0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,576
The conventional wisdom
about our world today

1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,720
is that this is a time
of terrible decline.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,696
And that's not surprising,
given the bad news all around us,

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,816
from ISIS to inequality,

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,256
political dysfunction, climate change,

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,320
Brexit, and on and on.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,680
But here's the thing,
and this may sound a little weird.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,000
I actually don't buy
this gloomy narrative,

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,736
and I don't think you should either.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,256
Look, it's not that
I don't see the problems.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,120
I read the same headlines that you do.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,816
What I dispute is the conclusion
that so many people draw from them,

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,736
namely that we're all screwed

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,856
because the problems are unsolvable

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,216
and our governments are useless.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,616
Now, why do I say this?

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,336
It's not like I'm particularly
optimistic by nature.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,056
But something about the media's
constant doom-mongering

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,776
with its fixation on problems
and not on answers

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,936
has always really bugged me.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,056
So a few years ago I decided,

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,976
well, I'm a journalist,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,976
I should see if I can do any better

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,536
by going around the world
and actually asking folks

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,816
if and how they've tackled

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,320
their big economic
and political challenges.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,600
And what I found astonished me.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
It turns out that there are remarkable
signs of progress out there,

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,776
often in the most unexpected places,

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,976
and they've convinced me
that our great global challenges

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,016
may not be so unsolvable after all.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,736
Not only are there theoretical fixes;

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,856
those fixes have been tried.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,616
They've worked.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
And they offer hope for the rest of us.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,016
I'm going to show you what I mean

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,896
by telling you about
how three of the countries I visited --

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,536
Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,880
overcame three supposedly
impossible problems.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,816
Their stories matter because they contain
tools the rest of us can use,

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,776
and not just for those
particular problems,

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,160
but for many others, too.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,336
When most people think
about my homeland, Canada, today,

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,980
if they think about Canada at all,

44
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:22,616
they think cold, they think boring,
they think polite.

45
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,840
They think we say "sorry" too much
in our funny accents.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,016
And that's all true.

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,576
(Laughter)

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,816
Sorry.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,336
(Laughter)

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
But Canada's also important

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,056
because of its triumph over a problem

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,736
currently tearing
many other countries apart:

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,056
immigration.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,496
Consider, Canada today is among
the world's most welcoming nations,

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,176
even compared to other
immigration-friendly countries.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,936
Its per capita immigration rate
is four times higher than France's,

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,136
and its percentage
of foreign-born residents

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,056
is double that of Sweden.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,816
Meanwhile, Canada admitted

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,576
10 times more Syrian refugees
in the last year

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,296
than did the United States.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,560
(Applause)

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,936
And now Canada is taking even more.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,816
And yet, if you ask Canadians

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,496
what makes them proudest of their country,

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,976
they rank "multiculturalism,"

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,216
a dirty word in most places,

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,456
second,

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,040
ahead of hockey.

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,936
Hockey.

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,000
(Laughter)

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,136
In other words,
at a time when other countries

73
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,416
are now frantically building
new barriers to keep foreigners out,

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,320
Canadians want even more of them in.

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,496
Now, here's the really interesting part.

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,936
Canada wasn't always like this.

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,400
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
an explicitly racist immigration policy.

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,776
They called it "White Canada,"

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,720
and as you can see, they were not
just talking about the snow.

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,280
So how did that Canada
become today's Canada?

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,736
Well, despite what my mom
in Ontario will tell you,

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,736
the answer had nothing to do with virtue.

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,136
Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.

84
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,816
The real explanation involves the man
who became Canada's leader in 1968,

85
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,096
Pierre Trudeau, who is also
the father of the current prime minister.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
(Applause)

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,016
The thing to know about that first Trudeau

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,935
is that he was very different
from Canada's previous leaders.

89
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,456
He was a French speaker in a country
long-dominated by its English elite.

90
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,056
He was an intellectual.

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,856
He was even kind of groovy.

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,536
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.

93
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,941
He hung out with the Beatles.

94
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,056
(Laughter)

95
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
And like all hipsters,
he could be infuriating at times.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,416
But he nevertheless pulled off

97
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,120
one of the most progressive
transformations any country has ever seen.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,696
His formula, I've learned,
involved two parts.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,696
First, Canada threw out
its old race-based immigration rules,

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,536
and it replaced them
with new color-blind ones

101
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,736
that emphasized education,
experience and language skills instead.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,256
And what that did
was greatly increase the odds

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,960
that newcomers would
contribute to the economy.

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,216
Then part two, Trudeau
created the world's first policy

105
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,416
of official multiculturalism
to promote integration

106
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,600
and the idea that diversity
was the key to Canada's identity.

107
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,016
Now, in the years that followed,
Ottawa kept pushing this message,

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,816
but at the same time, ordinary Canadians

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,336
soon started to see the economic,
the material benefits of multiculturalism

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,616
all around them.

111
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,256
And these two influences soon combined

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,880
to create the passionately
open-minded Canada of today.

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,136
Let's now turn to another country
and an even tougher problem,

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
Islamic extremism.

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,696
In 1998, the people of Indonesia
took to the streets

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
and overthrew
their longtime dictator, Suharto.

117
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,616
It was an amazing moment,

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,376
but it was also a scary one.

119
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,096
With 250 million people,

120
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,216
Indonesia is the largest
Muslim-majority country on Earth.

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,216
It's also hot, huge and unruly,

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,536
made up of 17,000 islands,

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,846
where people speak
close to a thousand languages.

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,176
Now, Suharto had been a dictator,

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,816
and a nasty one.

126
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,936
But he'd also been
a pretty effective tyrant,

127
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,256
and he'd always been careful
to keep religion out of politics.

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,856
So experts feared that without
him keeping a lid on things,

129
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,616
the country would explode,

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,536
or religious extremists would take over

131
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,440
and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,336
And that's just what seemed
to happen at first.

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,456
In the country's
first free elections, in 1999,

134
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,856
Islamist parties scored
36 percent of the vote,

135
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,536
and the islands burned

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,480
as riots and terror attacks
killed thousands.

137
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Since then, however,
Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,496
While ordinary folks have grown
more pious on a personal level --

139
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,696
I saw a lot more headscarves
on a recent visit

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,656
than I would have a decade ago --

141
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,160
the country's politics
have moved in the opposite direction.

142
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,480
Indonesia is now
a pretty decent democracy.

143
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,256
And yet, its Islamist parties
have steadily lost support,

144
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,616
from a high of about 38 percent in 2004

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,880
down to 25 percent in 2014.

146
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,016
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.

147
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,416
And while a few Indonesians
have recently joined ISIS,

148
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
their number is tiny,

149
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,816
far fewer in per capita terms

150
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,040
than the number of Belgians.

151
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,736
Try to think of one other
Muslim-majority country

152
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,176
that can say all those same things.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,096
In 2014, I went to Indonesia
to ask its current president,

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,696
a soft-spoken technocrat
named Joko Widodo,

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,160
"Why is Indonesia thriving when
so many other Muslim states are dying?"

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,936
"Well, what we realized," he told me,

157
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,816
"is that to deal with extremism,
we needed to deal with inequality first."

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,376
See, Indonesia's religious parties,
like similar parties elsewhere,

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,280
had tended to focus on things like
reducing poverty and cutting corruption.

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,616
So that's what Joko
and his predecessors did too,

161
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,560
thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.

162
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,096
They also cracked down hard on terrorism,

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,696
but Indonesia's democrats
have learned a key lesson

164
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,656
from the dark years of dictatorship,

165
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,320
namely that repression
only creates more extremism.

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,976
So they waged their war
with extraordinary delicacy.

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,056
They used the police instead of the army.

168
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,096
They only detained suspects
if they had enough evidence.

169
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,696
They held public trials.

170
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,416
They even sent
liberal imams into the jails

171
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
to persuade the jihadists
that terror is un-Islamic.

172
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,856
And all of this paid off
in spectacular fashion,

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,360
creating the kind of country
that was unimaginable 20 years ago.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,696
So at this point,
my optimism should, I hope,

175
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,536
be starting to make a bit more sense.

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,640
Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism
are impossible to deal with.

177
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,496
Join me now on one last trip,

178
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,160
this time to Mexico.

179
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,136
Now, of our three stories,
this one probably surprised me the most,

180
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,576
since as you all know,

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,696
the country is still struggling
with so many problems.

182
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,376
And yet, a few years ago,
Mexico did something

183
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,536
that many other countries
from France to India to the United States

184
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,456
can still only dream of.

185
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,040
It shattered the political paralysis
that had gripped it for years.

186
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,176
To understand how,
we need to rewind to the year 2000,

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,776
when Mexico finally became a democracy.

188
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,976
Rather than use their new freedoms
to fight for reform,

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,336
Mexico's politicians used them
to fight one another.

190
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,296
Congress deadlocked,
and the country's problems --

191
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,376
drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,976
spun out of control.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,616
Things got so bad that in 2008,

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,520
the Pentagon warned
that Mexico risked collapse.

195
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,056
Then in 2012, this guy
named Enrique Peña Nieto

196
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,960
somehow got himself elected president.

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
Now, this Peña hardly inspired
much confidence at first.

198
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,920
Sure, he was handsome,

199
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,856
but he came from Mexico's
corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,

200
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,720
and he was a notorious womanizer.

201
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,576
In fact, he seemed
like such a pretty boy lightweight

202
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,376
that women called him "bombón," sweetie,

203
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
at campaign rallies.

204
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,976
And yet this same bombón
soon surprised everyone

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,256
by hammering out a truce

206
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,296
between the country's
three warring political parties.

207
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,896
And over the next 18 months,
they together passed

208
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,856
an incredibly comprehensive
set of reforms.

209
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,936
They busted open Mexico's
smothering monopolies.

210
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,600
They liberalized
its rusting energy sector.

211
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,416
They restructured
its failing schools, and much more.

212
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,656
To appreciate the scale
of this accomplishment,

213
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,896
try to imagine the US Congress
passing immigration reform,

214
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,856
campaign finance reform
and banking reform.

215
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,320
Now, try to imagine Congress
doing it all at the same time.

216
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,120
That's what Mexico did.

217
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Not long ago, I met with Peña
and asked how he managed it all.

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,416
The President flashed me
his famous twinkly smile --

219
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
(Laughter)

220
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,576
and told me that the short answer
was "compromiso," compromise.

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,336
Of course, I pushed him for details,

222
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,896
and the long answer
that came out was essentially

223
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,520
"compromise, compromise
and more compromise."

224
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,056
See, Peña knew that he needed
to build trust early,

225
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,856
so he started talking to the opposition
just days after his election.

226
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,216
To ward off pressure
from special interests,

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,016
he kept their meetings small and secret,

228
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,336
and many of the participants
later told me that it was this intimacy,

229
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,016
plus a lot of shared tequila,

230
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
that helped build confidence.

231
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,456
So did the fact that all decisions
had to be unanimous,

232
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,616
and that Peña even agreed to pass
some of the other party's priorities

233
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,840
before his own.

234
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,856
As Santiago Creel,
an opposition senator, put it to me,

235
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,536
"Look, I'm not saying that I'm special
or that anyone is special,

236
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,400
but that group, that was special."

237
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,256
The proof?

238
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,616
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,

239
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,800
and Mexico moved forward
for the first time in years.

240
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,736
Bueno.

241
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,056
So now we've seen
how these three countries

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,616
overcame three of their great challenges.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,456
And that's very nice for them, right?

244
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,160
But what good does it do the rest of us?

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,576
Well, in the course of studying these
and a bunch of other success stories,

246
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,736
like the way Rwanda pulled itself
back together after civil war

247
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,496
or Brazil has reduced inequality,

248
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,256
or South Korea has kept its economy
growing faster and for longer

249
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,216
than any other country on Earth,

250
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,696
I've noticed a few common threads.

251
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,816
Now, before describing them,
I need to add a caveat.

252
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,456
I realize, of course,
that all countries are unique.

253
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,176
So you can't simply
take what worked in one,

254
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,896
port it to another
and expect it to work there too.

255
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,256
Nor do specific solutions work forever.

256
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,040
You've got to adapt them
as circumstances change.

257
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,496
That said, by stripping
these stories to their essence,

258
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,176
you absolutely can distill
a few common tools for problem-solving

259
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,136
that will work in other countries

260
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,456
and in boardrooms

261
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,800
and in all sorts of other contexts, too.

262
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,936
Number one, embrace the extreme.

263
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,896
In all the stories we've just looked at,

264
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,840
salvation came at a moment
of existential peril.

265
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,616
And that was no coincidence.

266
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,960
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.

267
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,296
First, though his vast,
underpopulated country

268
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,936
badly needed more bodies,

269
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,576
its preferred source
for white workers, Europe,

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,656
had just stopped exporting them
as it finally recovered from World War II.

271
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,176
The other problem was
that Canada's long cold war

272
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,016
between its French
and its English communities

273
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
had just become a hot one.

274
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,456
Quebec was threatening to secede,

275
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,256
and Canadians were actually
killing other Canadians over politics.

276
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,736
Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?

277
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,000
That's nothing special.

278
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,736
But Trudeau's genius
was to realize that Canada's crisis

279
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,320
had swept away all the hurdles
that usually block reform.

280
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
Canada had to open up. It had no choice.

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,816
And it had to rethink its identity.

282
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,536
Again, it had no choice.

283
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,096
And that gave Trudeau
a once-in-a-generation opportunity

284
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,720
to break the old rules and write new ones.

285
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,840
And like all our other heroes,
he was smart enough to seize it.

286
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,120
Number two, there's power
in promiscuous thinking.

287
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,136
Another striking similarity
among good problem-solvers

288
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,176
is that they're all pragmatists.

289
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,376
They'll steal the best answers
from wherever they find them,

290
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,776
and they don't let details

291
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,136
like party or ideology
or sentimentality get in their way.

292
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,456
As I mentioned earlier,
Indonesia's democrats were clever enough

293
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,256
to steal many of the Islamists'
best campaign promises for themselves.

294
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,176
They even invited some of the radicals
into their governing coalition.

295
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,720
Now, that horrified
a lot of secular Indonesians.

296
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,696
But by forcing the radicals
to actually help govern,

297
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,576
it quickly exposed the fact
that they weren't any good at the job,

298
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,616
and it got them mixed up
in all of the grubby compromises

299
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,696
and petty humiliations
that are part of everyday politics.

300
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,120
And that hurt their image so badly
that they've never recovered.

301
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,616
Number three,

302
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,480
please all of the people some of the time.

303
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,296
I know I just mentioned how crises
can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.

304
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,296
And that's true, but problem-solving
often requires more than just boldness.

305
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,896
It takes showing restraint, too,

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,576
just when that's
the last thing you want to do.

307
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,536
Take Trudeau: when he took office,

308
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,136
he could easily have put
his core constituency,

309
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,816
that is Canada's French community, first.

310
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,280
He could have pleased
some of the people all of the time.

311
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,456
And Peña could have used his power
to keep attacking the opposition,

312
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,256
as was traditional in Mexico.

313
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,416
Yet he chose to embrace
his enemies instead,

314
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,936
while forcing his own party to compromise.

315
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,136
And Trudeau pushed everyone
to stop thinking in tribal terms

316
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,656
and to see multiculturalism,
not language and not skin color,

317
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
as what made them
quintessentially Canadian.

318
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,456
Nobody got everything they wanted,

319
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,800
but everyone got just enough
that the bargains held.

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,976
So at this point you may be thinking,

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,216
"OK, Tepperman,

322
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,976
if the fixes really are out there
like you keep insisting,

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,520
then why aren't more countries
already using them?"

324
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,216
It's not like they require
special powers to pull off.

325
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,816
I mean, none of the leaders
we've just looked at were superheroes.

326
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,976
They didn't accomplish
anything on their own,

327
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,176
and they all had plenty of flaws.

328
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,616
Take Indonesia's
first democratic president,

329
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,296
Abdurrahman Wahid.

330
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,536
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic

331
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,656
that he once fell asleep

332
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,456
in the middle of his own speech.

333
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,096
(Laughter)

334
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
True story.

335
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,656
So what this tells us
is that the real obstacle is not ability,

336
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,496
and it's not circumstances.

337
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,576
It's something much simpler.

338
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,576
Making big changes
involves taking big risks,

339
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,640
and taking big risks is scary.

340
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,816
Overcoming that fear requires guts,

341
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,175
and as you all know,

342
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,640
gutsy politicians are painfully rare.

343
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,216
But that doesn't mean we voters

344
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,976
can't demand courage
from our political leaders.

345
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,810
I mean, that's why we put them
in office in the first place.

346
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,960
And given the state of the world today,
there's really no other option.

347
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,696
The answers are out there,

348
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,056
but now it's up to us

349
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,616
to elect more women and men

350
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,016
brave enough to find them,

351
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,416
to steal them

352
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,056
and to make them work.

353
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,456
Thank you.

354
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,791
(Applause)
