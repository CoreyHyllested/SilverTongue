0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,530
So the machine I'm going to talk you about

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,204
is what I call the greatest machine that never was.

3
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:17,203
It was a machine that was never built,

4
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,583
and yet, it will be built.

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,575
It was a machine that was designed

6
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,926
long before anyone thought about computers.

7
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:26,075
If you know anything about the history of computers,

8
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,595
you will know that in the '30s and the '40s,

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,150
simple computers were created

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,943
that started the computer revolution we have today,

11
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:35,229
and you would be correct,

12
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,711
except for you'd have the wrong century.

13
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,351
The first computer was really designed

14
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:43,023
in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.

15
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:45,351
It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,

16
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,487
and the bits of it that were built are here

17
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,480
in South Kensington.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,799
That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,555
Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,164
because his hair is always completely unkempt like this

21
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:59,505
in every single picture. (Laughter)

22
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,352
He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,

23
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,365
part of the aristocracy of Britain,

24
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,704
and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,

25
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,135
were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,

26
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,631
you would have been invited round to his house

27
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:12,590
for a soiree — and he invited everybody:

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,022
kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —

29
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,543
and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

30
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,583
I really miss that era, you know, where you could

31
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,931
go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer

32
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:25,044
get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)

33
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,310
But Babbage, Babbage himself was born

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,044
at the end of the 18th century,

35
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,088
and was a fairly famous mathematician.

36
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:35,231
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,

37
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,743
and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.

38
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:40,598
He's less well known than either of them because

39
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:43,748
he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices

40
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:46,033
and never made any of them.

41
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:49,318
The reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.

42
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,329
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think,

43
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,777
"That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.

44
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,372
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.

45
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:57,732
I'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."

46
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:00,612
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,

47
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:03,076
basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,

48
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,517
and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,

49
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:08,669
"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,649
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,088
the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,

52
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,960
this is a view from above.

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,073
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,

54
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,309
and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.

55
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,300
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,944
this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds

57
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,704
of what this thing would have sounded like.

58
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:30,481
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine

59
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,960
— that's why it's computer architecture —

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,287
and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.

61
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:38,690
So let's talk about the memory. The memory

62
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,937
is very like the memory of a computer today,

63
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:43,639
except it was all made out of metal,

64
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,183
stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.

65
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,253
Imagine a thing this high of cogs,

66
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,008
hundreds and hundreds of them,

67
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,898
and they've got numbers on them.

68
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,317
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.

69
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,902
And he thought about using binary. The problem

70
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,620
with using binary is that the machine would have been so

71
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,937
tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.

72
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,996
So he's got memory.

73
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,403
The memory is this bit over here.

74
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,733
You see it all like this.

75
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:13,268
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.

76
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,518
Of course, it's this big.

77
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:18,431
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.

78
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,572
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU

79
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,711
which is in the Science Museum.

80
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:28,343
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic --

81
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,796
so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division --

82
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,804
which already is a bit of a feat in metal,

83
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:36,433
but it could also do something that a computer does

84
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,132
and a calculator doesn't:

85
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:42,070
this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.

86
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,936
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers,

87
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,076
and that fundamentally made it into a computer.

88
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,674
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.

89
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:54,355
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,

90
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,226
and we think about chips today, we can't

91
00:03:56,226 --> 00:04:00,041
look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.

92
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,842
Yet if you did, you would see something

93
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,664
very, very similar to this.

94
00:04:03,664 --> 00:04:06,611
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU,

95
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,303
and this incredible regularity in the memory.

96
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,965
If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,

97
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,934
you'll see this. This all looks the same,

98
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,500
then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.

99
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,483
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,

100
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,576
but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,

101
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,601
Babbage used the technology of the day

102
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:28,247
and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,

103
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,116
which is punch cards. This thing over here

104
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,940
is one of three punch card readers in here,

105
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,620
and this is a program in the Science Museum, just

106
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,013
not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,

107
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,881
that is sitting there — you can go see it —

108
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,322
waiting for the machine to be built.

109
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,742
And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.

110
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:52,832
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.

111
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,805
Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,

112
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:56,977
in France, had created the Jacquard loom,

113
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,655
which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,

114
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,287
so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,

115
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,392
and like everything else he did, he's using the technology

116
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:09,139
of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,

117
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,077
mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year

118
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,249
as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,

119
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,926
who would completely revolutionize everything

120
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,439
with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.

121
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,597
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,

122
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:25,150
so steam and things.

123
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,823
Now, he needed accessories.

124
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,495
Obviously, you've got a computer now.

125
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,884
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.

126
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,819
You need accessories you're going to come with.

127
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,447
You're not just going to have that,

128
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:37,275
So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,

129
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,429
so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —

130
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,774
or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,

131
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,744
there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)

132
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,280
And there's actually an instruction on the punch card

133
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,182
which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"

134
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,382
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,

135
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,463
this thing, "Click, clack click click click,"

136
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:54,400
steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)

137
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,835
You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.

138
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,843
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for

139
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,326
another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,

140
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,261
which he never built, but which the Science Museum

141
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:06,432
did build in the '80s and '90s.

142
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,707
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.

143
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:11,405
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,

144
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,922
but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,

145
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:17,694
so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.

146
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,344
You also need graphics, right?

147
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,900
I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,

148
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,496
so he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper

149
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,604
and an ink pen and I'll make it plot."

150
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,434
So he designed a plotter as well,

151
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:31,359
and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much

152
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,890
a pretty good machine.

153
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,580
Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.

154
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,301
Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.

155
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,393
This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad

156
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,815
and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,

157
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,335
and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have

158
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:49,192
inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,

159
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:52,430
thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.

160
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,379
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."

161
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,135
(Laughter) Because of course,

162
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:03,050
there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,

163
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,451
so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)

164
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,789
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,

165
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,527
and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,

166
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:14,317
and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.

167
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,151
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,

168
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,723
get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,

169
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,474
and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,

170
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,766
who said, "I understand what this does,

171
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,973
and I understand the future of this machine."

172
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,060
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know

173
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,037
a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build

174
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,640
because of her.

175
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,397
Now, some people call her the first programmer.

176
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:38,783
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.

177
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:41,694
This is a program written in a particular style.

178
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,263
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,

179
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:47,316
and actually, she did something more amazing.

180
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,886
Rather than just being a programmer,

181
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,058
she saw something that Babbage didn't.

182
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,242
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.

183
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:58,191
He was building a machine to do mathematics,

184
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:01,450
and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics

185
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,285
on this machine." And just as you do,

186
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,910
everyone in this room already's got a computer on them

187
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,964
right now, because they've got a phone.

188
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:10,192
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone

189
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:12,207
or computer or any other computing device

190
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,288
is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.

191
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:18,981
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,

192
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,961
it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,

193
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,066
and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing

194
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:28,388
mathematical functions and symbols

195
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,635
doesn't mean these things can't represent

196
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,988
other things in the real world, such as music."

197
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:36,722
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,

198
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,944
"We could compute these amazing functions and print out

199
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:42,612
tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) —

200
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,508
and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,

201
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,984
this thing could even compose music if you

202
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,532
told it a representation of music numerically."

203
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,101
So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.

204
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,838
When you say she's a programmer, she did do some,

205
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,975
but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be

206
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:01,171
much, much more than this.

207
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,350
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,

208
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,803
Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.

209
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:11,380
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.

210
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,911
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.

211
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:16,702
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,

212
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,255
but Turing told us something very important.

213
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:22,190
He laid down the mathematical foundations

214
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,303
for computer science, and said,

215
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:27,490
"It doesn't matter how you make a computer."

216
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,368
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,

217
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,778
like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,

218
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:36,582
or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,

219
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,728
mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.

220
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,765
We could go back to Babbage's machine

221
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,341
and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.

222
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,973
There is in a sense a computing essence.

223
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,978
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.

224
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,645
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say

225
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:52,868
this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.

226
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,693
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today

227
00:09:55,693 --> 00:10:00,525
with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)

228
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,631
To give you an idea of how slowly,

229
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:06,470
it had about 1k of memory.

230
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,388
It used punch cards, which were being fed in,

231
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:15,148
and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.

232
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,751
It did have a RAM pack.

233
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,930
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.

234
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,256
(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?

235
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,864
So there are plans.

236
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,797
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,

237
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:28,491
there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages

238
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:31,960
of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.

239
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,921
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,

240
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:38,075
and that is also the name of a charity that I started

241
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,809
with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing

242
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,048
at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove

243
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,478
the project to build a difference engine,

244
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,036
and our plan is to build it.

245
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:50,902
Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.

246
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,904
The project has a number of parts to it.

247
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:55,424
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.

248
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:57,346
That's been done. The second is now the study

249
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:00,456
of all of those plans to determine what to build.

250
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:04,900
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,

251
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,823
and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.

252
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:10,399
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,

253
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,233
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,

254
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,843
you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,

255
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:18,178
I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,

256
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,045
I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)

257
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:24,644
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.

258
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:26,401
Babbage himself wrote, he said,

259
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,019
as soon as the analytical engine exists,

260
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,723
it will surely guide the future course of science.

261
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,568
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling

262
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,650
with new plans, but when it did get built, of course,

263
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,160
in the 1940s, everything changed.

264
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,983
Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like

265
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,616
in motion with a video which shows

266
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:48,210
just one part of the CPU mechanism working.

267
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,209
So this is just three sets of cogs,

268
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,031
and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism

269
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:59,688
in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.

270
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,847
So, give me five years.

271
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,191
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.

272
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:06,161
Thank you very much. (Applause)
