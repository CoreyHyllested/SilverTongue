00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,136
Half of the human workforce
is expected to be replaced

1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
by software and robots
in the next 20 years.

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,680
And many corporate leaders welcome
that as a chance to increase profits.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,816
Machines are more efficient;

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,800
humans are complicated
and difficult to manage.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,176
Well, I want our organizations
to remain human.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
In fact, I want them to become beautiful.

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,735
Because as machines take our jobs
and do them more efficiently,

8
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,976
soon the only work left for us humans
will be the kind of work

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,080
that must be done beautifully
rather than efficiently.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,936
To maintain our humanity
in the this second Machine Age,

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
we may have no other choice
than to create beauty.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,456
Beauty is an elusive concept.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,880
For the writer Stendhal
it was the promise of happiness.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,856
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,296
(Laughter)

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,896
So bear with me

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,296
as I am proposing four admittedly
very subjective principles

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,240
that you can use to build
a beautiful organization.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,496
First: do the unnecessary.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,736
[Do the Unnecessary]

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,456
the CEO and founder
of the yogurt company Chobani,

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,040
made headlines when he decided to grant
stock to all of his 2,000 employees.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,536
Some called it a PR stunt,

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,776
others -- a genuine act of giving back.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,480
But there is something else
that was remarkable about it.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,056
It came completely out of the blue.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,696
There had been no market
or stakeholder pressure,

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,696
and employees were so surprised

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,200
that they burst into tears
when they heard the news.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,920
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful
because they catch us off guard.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,976
They create something out of nothing

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
because they're completely unnecessary.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,096
I once worked at a company

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,696
that was the result of a merger

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,376
of a large IT outsourcing firm
and a small design firm.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,376
We were merging 9,000 software engineers

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,160
with 1,000 creative types.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,536
And to unify these
immensely different cultures,

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,616
we were going to launch
a third, new brand.

41
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,136
And the new brand color
was going to be orange.

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,576
And as we were going
through the budget for the rollouts,

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,656
we decided last minute

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,336
to cut the purchase
of 10,000 orange balloons,

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,160
which we had meant
to distribute to all staff worldwide.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,960
They just seemed
unnecessary and cute in the end.

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,816
I didn't know back then

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,376
that our decision
marked the beginning of the end --

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
that these two organizations
would never become one.

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,616
And sure enough,
the merger eventually failed.

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,456
Now, was it because
there weren't any orange balloons?

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,080
No, of course not.

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,920
But the kill-the-orange-balloons
mentality permeated everything else.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,896
You might not always realize it,
but when you cut the unnecessary,

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
you cut everything.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Leading with beauty means
rising above what is merely necessary.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,920
So do not kill your orange balloons.

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,696
The second principle:

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,056
create intimacy.

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,456
[Create Intimacy]

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,296
Studies show that
how we feel about our workplace

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,040
very much depends on the relationships
with our coworkers.

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,096
And what are relationships
other than a string of microinteractions?

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,336
There are hundreds of these
every day in our organizations

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,640
that have the potential to distinguish
a good life from a beautiful one.

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,456
The marriage researcher John Gottman says

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,096
that the secret of a healthy relationship

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,176
is not the great gesture
or the lofty promise,

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
it's small moments of attachment.

70
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,880
In other words, intimacy.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,656
In our networked organizations,

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,296
we tout the strength of weak ties

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,176
but we underestimate
the strength of strong ones.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,096
We forget the words of the writer
Richard Bach who once said,

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,336
"Intimacy --

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,576
not connectedness --

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,920
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,280
So how do we design
for organizational intimacy?

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,336
The humanitarian organization CARE

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,736
wanted to launch
a campaign on gender equality

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
in villages in northern India.

82
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,376
But it realized quickly

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,360
that it had to have this conversation
first with its own staff.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,016
So it invited all 36 team members
and their partners

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,776
to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,560
known for their famous erotic sculptures.

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,096
And there they openly discussed
their personal relationships --

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
their own experiences of gender equality

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,016
with the coworkers and the partners.

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,336
It was eye-opening for the participants.

91
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,376
Not only did it allow them
to relate to the communities they serve,

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,936
it also broke down invisible barriers

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,176
and created a lasting bond
amongst themselves.

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,960
Not a single team member
quit in the next four years.

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
So this is how you create intimacy.

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,080
No masks ...

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,536
or lots of masks.

98
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,776
(Laughter)

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,256
When Danone, the food company,

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,840
wanted to translate its new company
manifesto into product initiatives,

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,696
it gathered the management team

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,336
and 100 employees
from across different departments,

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,976
seniority levels and regions

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,120
for a three-day strategy retreat.

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,256
And it asked everybody
to wear costumes for the entire meeting:

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,376
wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,

107
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
huge glasses and so on.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,816
And they left with concrete outcomes

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
and full of enthusiasm.

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,016
And when I asked the woman
who had designed this experience

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,256
why it worked,

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,096
she simply said, "Never underestimate
the power of a ridiculous wig."

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,296
(Laughter)

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,680
(Applause)

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,056
Because wigs erase hierarchy,

116
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,936
and hierarchy kills intimacy --

117
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,176
both ways,

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,880
for the CEO and the intern.

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,576
Wigs allow us to use
the disguise of the false

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,040
to show something true about ourselves.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,336
And that's not easy
in our everyday work lives,

122
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,696
because the relationship
with our organizations

123
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,600
is often like that of a married couple
that has grown apart,

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,256
suffered betrayals and disappointments,

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,600
and is now desperate to be beautiful
for one another once again.

126
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,360
And for either of us the first step
towards beauty involves a huge risk.

127
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,736
The risk to be ugly.

[Be Ugly]

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,376
So many organizations these days
are keen on designing beautiful workplaces

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,016
that look like anything but work:

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,056
vacation resorts, coffee shops,
playgrounds or college campuses --

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,296
(Laughter)

133
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,496
Based on the promises
of positive psychology,

134
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,896
we speak of play and gamification,

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,456
and one start-up even says
that when someone gets fired,

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,776
they have graduated.

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,776
(Laughter)

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,296
That kind of beautiful language
only goes "skin deep,

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,560
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"

140
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,456
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.

141
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,000
To be authentic is to be ugly.

142
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,216
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun
or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,640
but it does mean that you speak
the actual ugly truth.

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,016
Like this manufacturer

145
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,776
that wanted to transform
one of its struggling business units.

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,216
It identified, named and pinned
on large boards all the issues --

147
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,896
and there were hundreds of them --

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,216
that had become obstacles
to better performance.

149
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,816
They put them on boards,
moved them all into one room,

150
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,096
which they called "the ugly room."

151
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,496
The ugly became visible
for everyone to see --

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,336
it was celebrated.

153
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,216
And the ugly room served as a mix
of mirror exhibition and operating room --

154
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,760
a biopsy on the living flesh
to cut out all the bureaucracy.

155
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,840
The ugliest part of our body is our brain.

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,176
Literally and neurologically.

157
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,440
Our brain renders ugly
what is unfamiliar ...

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,416
modern art, atonal music,

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,656
jazz, maybe --

160
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,376
VR goggles for that matter --

161
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,480
strange objects, sounds and people.

162
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,496
But we've all been ugly once.

163
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,200
We were a weird-looking baby,

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,160
a new kid on the block, a foreigner.

165
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,440
And we will be ugly again
when we don't belong.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,216
The Center for Political Beauty,

167
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,856
an activist collective in Berlin,

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,560
recently staged an extreme
artistic intervention.

169
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,096
With the permission of relatives,

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,256
it exhumed the corpses of refugees
who had drowned at Europe's borders,

171
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,176
transported them all the way to Berlin,

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
and then reburied them
at the heart of the German capital.

173
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,096
The idea was to allow them
to reach their desired destination,

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
if only after their death.

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,976
Such acts of beautification
may not be pretty,

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,256
but they are much needed.

177
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,736
Because things tend to get ugly
when there's only one meaning, one truth,

178
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
only answers and no questions.

179
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Beautiful organizations
keep asking questions.

180
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,600
They remain incomplete,

181
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:07,656
which is the fourth
and the last of the principles.

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,216
[Remain Incomplete]

183
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,560
Recently I was in Paris,

184
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,376
and a friend of mine
took me to Nuit Debout,

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,936
which stands for "up all night,"

186
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,896
the self-organized protest movement

187
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,840
that had formed in response
to the proposed labor laws in France.

188
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,896
Every night, hundreds gathered
at the Place de la République.

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,496
Every night they set up
a small, temporary village

190
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,120
to deliberate their own vision
of the French Republic.

191
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,776
And at the core of this adhocracy

192
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,056
was a general assembly
where anybody could speak

193
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,680
using a specially designed sign language.

194
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,176
Like Occupy Wall Street
and other protest movements,

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,096
Nuit Debout was born
in the face of crisis.

196
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,576
It was messy --

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,920
full of controversies and contradictions.

198
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,696
But whether you agreed
with the movement's goals or not,

199
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,440
every gathering was
a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.

200
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,656
And how fitting that Paris --

201
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,456
the city of ideals, the city of beauty --

202
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,696
was it's stage.

203
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,536
It reminds us that like great cities,

204
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,736
the most beautiful organizations
are ideas worth fighting for --

205
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
even and especially
when their outcome is uncertain.

206
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,776
They are movements;

207
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,136
they are always imperfect,
never fully organized,

208
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,856
so they avoid ever becoming banal.

209
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,216
They have something
but we don't know what it is.

210
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,176
They remain mysterious;
we can't take our eyes off them.

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,160
We find them beautiful.

212
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,096
So to do the unnecessary,

213
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,776
to create intimacy,

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,296
to be ugly,

215
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,880
to remain incomplete --

216
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,536
these are not only the qualities
of beautiful organizations,

217
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,000
these are inherently
human characteristics.

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,240
And these are also the qualities
of what we call home.

219
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,936
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,

220
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,256
the least we can do is to ensure

221
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,296
that we still feel at home
in our organizations,

222
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,720
and that we use our organizations
to create that feeling for others.

223
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,696
Beauty can save the world
when we embrace these principles

224
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
and design for them.

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,376
In the face of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

226
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,736
we need a new radical humanism.

227
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,160
We must acquire and promote
a new aesthetic and sentimental education.

228
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
Because if we don't,

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,816
we might end up feeling like aliens

230
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,856
in organizations and societies
that are full of smart machines

231
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,696
that have no appreciation whatsoever

232
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,336
for the unnecessary,

233
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,616
the intimate,

234
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,336
the incomplete

235
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
and definitely not for the ugly.

236
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,976
Thank you.

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,862
(Applause)
