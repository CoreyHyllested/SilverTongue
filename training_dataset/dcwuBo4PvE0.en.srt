0
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,536
I am British.

1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,696
(Laughter)

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,856
(Applause)

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,656
Never before has the phrase
"I am British" elicited so much pity.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,776
(Laughter)

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,536
I come from an island
where many of us like to believe

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,680
there's been a lot of continuity
over the last thousand years.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,136
We tend to have historically
imposed change on others

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
but done much less of it ourselves.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,816
So it came as an immense shock to me

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,616
when I woke up on the morning of June 24

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,496
to discover that my country
had voted to leave the European Union,

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,376
my Prime Minister had resigned,

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,976
and Scotland was considering a referendum

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,840
that could bring to an end
the very existence of the United Kingdom.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,856
So that was an immense shock for me,

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,160
and it was an immense
shock for many people,

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,536
but it was also something
that, over the following several days,

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,296
created a complete political meltdown

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,776
in my country.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,016
There were calls for a second referendum,

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,576
almost as if, following a sports match,

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,120
we could ask the opposition for a replay.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,336
Everybody was blaming everybody else.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,936
People blamed the Prime Minister

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,136
for calling the referendum
in the first place.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,616
They blamed the leader of the opposition
for not fighting it hard enough.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,896
The young accused the old.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,800
The educated blamed
the less well-educated.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,536
That complete meltdown was made even worse

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,656
by the most tragic element of it:

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,536
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
in the streets of Britain

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,816
at a level that I have never seen before

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,080
in my lifetime.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,176
People are now talking about whether
my country is becoming a Little England,

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,296
or, as one of my colleagues put it,

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,496
whether we're about to become
a 1950s nostalgia theme park

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,536
floating in the Atlantic Ocean.

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
(Laughter)

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,376
But my question is really,

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,680
should we have the degree of shock
that we've experienced since?

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,816
Was it something
that took place overnight?

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,336
Or are there deeper structural factors
that have led us to where we are today?

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,936
So I want to take a step back
and ask two very basic questions.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,856
First, what does Brexit represent,

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,416
not just for my country,

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,176
but for all of us around the world?

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,376
And second, what can we do about it?

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,736
How should we all respond?

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,280
So first, what does Brexit represent?

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,200
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,896
Brexit teaches us many things
about our society

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,280
and about societies around the world.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,616
It highlights in ways
that we seem embarrassingly unaware of

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
how divided our societies are.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,176
The vote split along lines of age,
education, class and geography.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,096
Young people didn't turn out
to vote in great numbers,

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,336
but those that did wanted to remain.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,096
Older people really wanted
to leave the European Union.

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,616
Geographically, it was London and Scotland
that most strongly committed

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,656
to being part of the European Union,

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,800
while in other parts of the country
there was very strong ambivalence.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,376
Those divisions are things we really
need to recognize and take seriously.

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,256
But more profoundly,
the vote teaches us something

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,616
about the nature of politics today.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,896
Contemporary politics
is no longer just about right and left.

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,656
It's no longer just about tax and spend.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,616
It's about globalization.

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,456
The fault line of contemporary politics is
between those that embrace globalization

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
and those that fear globalization.

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,600
(Applause)

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,336
If we look at why
those who wanted to leave --

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,896
we call them "Leavers,"
as opposed to "Remainers" --

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,136
we see two factors in the opinion polls

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,536
that really mattered.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,896
The first was immigration,
and the second sovereignty,

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,376
and these represent a desire for people
to take back control of their own lives

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,280
and the feeling that they
are unrepresented by politicians.

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,936
But those ideas are ones
that signify fear and alienation.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,976
They represent a retreat
back towards nationalism and borders

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,079
in ways that many of us would reject.

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,816
What I want to suggest is the picture
is more complicated than that,

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,376
that liberal internationalists,

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,616
like myself, and I firmly
include myself in that picture,

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,176
need to write ourselves
back into the picture

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,280
in order to understand
how we've got to where we are today.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,296
When we look at the voting patterns
across the United Kingdom,

87
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,520
we can visibly see the divisions.

88
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,576
The blue areas show Remain

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,696
and the red areas Leave.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,976
When I looked at this,

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,856
what personally struck me
was the very little time in my life

92
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,096
I've actually spent
in many of the red areas.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,256
I suddenly realized that,
looking at the top 50 areas in the UK

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,136
that have the strongest Leave vote,

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,560
I've spent a combined total
of four days of my life in those areas.

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,056
In some of those places,

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,656
I didn't even know the names
of the voting districts.

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,536
It was a real shock to me,

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,616
and it suggested that people like me

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,736
who think of ourselves
as inclusive, open and tolerant,

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,456
perhaps don't know
our own countries and societies

102
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,096
nearly as well as we like to believe.

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,000
(Applause)

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,976
And the challenge that comes from that
is we need to find a new way

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,096
to narrate globalization to those people,

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,496
to recognize that for those people who
have not necessarily been to university,

107
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,936
who haven't necessarily
grown up with the Internet,

108
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,976
that don't get opportunities to travel,

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,856
they may be unpersuaded
by the narrative that we find persuasive

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,080
in our often liberal bubbles.

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,040
(Applause)

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,496
It means that we need to reach out
more broadly and understand.

113
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,536
In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled
the politics of fear and hatred,

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,056
creating lies and mistrust

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,016
around, for instance,
the idea that the vote on Europe

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,176
could reduce the number of refugees
and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,

117
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,456
when the vote on leaving
had nothing to do with immigration

118
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
from outside the European Union.

119
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,656
But for a significant majority
of the Leave voters

120
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,336
the concern was disillusionment
with the political establishment.

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,536
This was a protest vote for many,

122
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,016
a sense that nobody represented them,

123
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,456
that they couldn't find
a political party that spoke for them,

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,720
and so they rejected
that political establishment.

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,496
This replicates around Europe
and much of the liberal democratic world.

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,416
We see it with the rise in popularity
of Donald Trump in the United States,

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,496
with the growing nationalism
of Viktor Orbán in Hungary,

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,216
with the increase in popularity
of Marine Le Pen in France.

129
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,120
The specter of Brexit
is in all of our societies.

130
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,096
So the question I think we need to ask
is my second question,

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,640
which is how should we
collectively respond?

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,256
For all of us who care about creating
liberal, open, tolerant societies,

133
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,936
we urgently need a new vision,

134
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,656
a vision of a more tolerant,
inclusive globalization,

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,480
one that brings people with us
rather than leaving them behind.

136
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,576
That vision of globalization

137
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,416
is one that has to start by a recognition
of the positive benefits of globalization.

138
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,016
The consensus amongst economists

139
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,816
is that free trade,
the movement of capital,

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,776
the movement of people across borders

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,536
benefit everyone on aggregate.

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,256
The consensus amongst
international relations scholars

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,896
is that globalization
brings interdependence,

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,856
which brings cooperation and peace.

145
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,336
But globalization
also has redistributive effects.

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,096
It creates winners and losers.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,256
To take the example of migration,

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,936
we know that immigration is a net positive
for the economy as a whole

149
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,480
under almost all circumstances.

150
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,136
But we also have to be very aware

151
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,216
that there are
redistributive consequences,

152
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,696
that importantly, low-skilled immigration

153
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,135
can lead to a reduction in wages
for the most impoverished in our societies

154
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,296
and also put pressure on house prices.

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,856
That doesn't detract
from the fact that it's positive,

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,775
but it means more people
have to share in those benefits

157
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,080
and recognize them.

158
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,096
In 2002, the former Secretary-General
of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,016
gave a speech at Yale University,

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,016
and that speech was on the topic
of inclusive globalization.

161
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,096
That was the speech
in which he coined that term.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,896
And he said, and I paraphrase,

163
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,256
"The glass house of globalization
has to be open to all

164
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,840
if it is to remain secure.

165
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,536
Bigotry and ignorance

166
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,136
are the ugly face of exclusionary
and antagonistic globalization."

167
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,336
That idea of inclusive globalization
was briefly revived in 2008

168
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,936
in a conference on progressive governance

169
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,400
involving many of the leaders
of European countries.

170
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,136
But amid austerity
and the financial crisis of 2008,

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,256
the concept disappeared
almost without a trace.

172
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,736
Globalization has been taken
to support a neoliberal agenda.

173
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,696
It's perceived to be
part of an elite agenda

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,296
rather than something that benefits all.

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,936
And it needs to be reclaimed
on a far more inclusive basis

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,160
than it is today.

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,456
So the question is,
how can we achieve that goal?

178
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,216
How can we balance on the one hand
addressing fear and alienation

179
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,656
while on the other hand
refusing vehemently

180
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,456
to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?

181
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,616
That is the question for all of us.

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,456
And I think, as a social scientist,

183
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,280
that social science
offers some places to start.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,216
Our transformation has to be about
both ideas and about material change,

185
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,856
and I want to give you four ideas
as a starting point.

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,416
The first relates to the idea
of civic education.

187
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,216
What stands out from Brexit

188
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,296
is the gap between public perception
and empirical reality.

189
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,016
It's been suggested that we've moved
to a postfactual society,

190
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,696
where evidence and truth no longer matter,

191
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,816
and lies have equal status
to the clarity of evidence.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,096
So how can we --

193
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,816
(Applause)

194
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,016
How can we rebuild respect for truth
and evidence into our liberal democracies?

195
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,976
It has to begin with education,

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,320
but it has to start with the recognition
that there are huge gaps.

197
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,616
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI

198
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,936
published a survey
on attitudes to immigration,

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,976
and it showed that as numbers
of immigrants increase,

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,216
so public concern
with immigration also increases,

201
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,656
although it obviously
didn't unpack causality,

202
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,816
because this could equally be to do
not so much with numbers

203
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,240
but the political
and media narrative around it.

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,576
But the same survey also revealed

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,736
huge public misinformation

206
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,496
and misunderstanding
about the nature of immigration.

207
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,736
For example, in these attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

208
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,496
the public believed that levels of asylum

209
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,936
were a greater proportion
of immigration than they were,

210
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,416
but they also believed
the levels of educational migration

211
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,536
were far lower as a proportion
of overall migration

212
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,056
than they actually are.

213
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,736
So we have to address this misinformation,

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,256
the gap between perception and reality
on key aspects of globalization.

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,096
And that can't just be something
that's left to our schools,

216
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,536
although that's important
to begin at an early age.

217
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,616
It has to be about lifelong
civic participation

218
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,800
and public engagement
that we all encourage as societies.

219
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,776
The second thing
that I think is an opportunity

220
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,416
is the idea to encourage more interaction
across diverse communities.

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,040
(Applause)

222
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,736
One of the things that stands out
for me very strikingly,

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,616
looking at immigration attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,416
is that ironically,
the regions of my country

225
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,345
that are the most tolerant of immigrants

226
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,136
have the highest numbers of immigrants.

227
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,496
So for instance, London and the Southeast
have the highest numbers of immigrants,

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,656
and they are also by far
the most tolerant areas.

229
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,296
It's those areas of the country
that have the lowest levels of immigration

230
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,840
that actually are the most exclusionary
and intolerant towards migrants.

231
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,736
So we need to encourage exchange programs.

232
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,216
We need to ensure that older generations
who maybe can't travel

233
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,376
get access to the Internet.

234
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,096
We need to encourage,
even on a local and national level,

235
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,976
more movement, more participation,

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,696
more interaction
with people who we don't know

237
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,640
and whose views we might
not necessarily agree with.

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,216
The third thing that I think
is crucial, though,

239
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,016
and this is really fundamental,

240
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,336
is we have to ensure that everybody shares

241
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,600
in the benefits of globalization.

242
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,256
This illustration from the Financial Times
post-Brexit is really striking.

243
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,016
It shows tragically that those people
who voted to leave the European Union

244
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,856
were those who actually
benefited the most materially

245
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,400
from trade with the European Union.

246
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,616
But the problem is
that those people in those areas

247
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,296
didn't perceive themselves
to be beneficiaries.

248
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,096
They didn't believe that they
were actually getting access

249
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,840
to material benefits of increased trade
and increased mobility around the world.

250
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,576
I work on questions
predominantly to do with refugees,

251
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,256
and one of the ideas
I spent a lot of my time preaching,

252
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,056
mainly to developing countries
around the world,

253
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,656
is that in order to encourage
the integration of refugees,

254
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,016
we can't just benefit
the refugee populations,

255
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,080
we also have to address the concerns
of the host communities in local areas.

256
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,816
But in looking at that,

257
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,856
one of the policy prescriptions
is that we have to provide

258
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,496
disproportionately better
education facilities, health facilities,

259
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,296
access to social services

260
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,576
in those regions of high immigration

261
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,416
to address the concerns
of those local populations.

262
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,096
But while we encourage that
around the developing world,

263
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,696
we don't take those lessons home

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,560
and incorporate them in our own societies.

265
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,536
Furthermore, if we're going
to really take seriously

266
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,896
the need to ensure people share
in the economic benefits,

267
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,576
our businesses and corporations
need a model of globalization

268
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,200
that recognizes that they, too,
have to take people with them.

269
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,496
The fourth and final idea
I want to put forward

270
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,400
is an idea that we need
more responsible politics.

271
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,216
There's very little
social science evidence

272
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,056
that compares attitudes on globalization.

273
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,616
But from the surveys that do exist,

274
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,376
what we can see is there's huge variation
across different countries

275
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,696
and time periods in those countries

276
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,096
for attitudes and tolerance

277
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,816
of questions like migration
and mobility on the one hand

278
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,896
and free trade on the other.

279
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,176
But one hypothesis that I think emerges
from a cursory look at that data

280
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,296
is the idea that polarized societies
are far less tolerant of globalization.

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,136
It's the societies
like Sweden in the past,

282
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,576
like Canada today,

283
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,416
where there is a centrist politics,

284
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,496
where right and left work together,

285
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,536
that we encourage supportive attitudes
towards globalization.

286
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,376
And what we see around the world today
is a tragic polarization,

287
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,416
a failure to have dialogue
between the extremes in politics,

288
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,216
and a gap in terms
of that liberal center ground

289
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,056
that can encourage communication
and a shared understanding.

290
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,696
We might not achieve that today,

291
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,536
but at the very least we have to call
upon our politicians and our media

292
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,336
to drop a language of fear
and be far more tolerant of one another.

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
(Applause)

294
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,576
These ideas are very tentative,

295
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,000
and that's in part because this needs
to be an inclusive and shared project.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
I am still British.

297
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,080
I am still European.

298
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I am still a global citizen.

299
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,216
For those of us who believe

300
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,336
that our identities
are not mutually exclusive,

301
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,376
we have to all work together

302
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,096
to ensure that globalization
takes everyone with us

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,336
and doesn't leave people behind.

304
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,936
Only then will we truly reconcile
democracy and globalization.

305
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,176
Thank you.

306
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:21,480
(Applause)
