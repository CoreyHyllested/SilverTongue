00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,611
Last year, I went on my first book tour.

1
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,589
In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries

2
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,922
and gave some hundred talks.

3
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,975
Every talk in every country

4
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,975
began with an introduction,

5
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,824
and every introduction began,
alas, with a lie:

6
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:35,888
"Taiye Selasi comes
from Ghana and Nigeria,"

7
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,991
or "Taiye Selasi comes
from England and the States."

8
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:42,975
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,

9
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,564
no matter the country that concluded it --

10
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,975
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --

11
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,571
I thought, "But that's not true."

12
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:55,126
Yes, I was born in England
and grew up in the United States.

13
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:58,783
My mum, born in England,
and raised in Nigeria,

14
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,791
currently lives in Ghana.

15
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:05,040
My father was born in Gold Coast,
a British colony,

16
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,649
raised in Ghana,

17
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:10,780
and has lived for over 30 years
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

18
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,967
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."

19
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:20,466
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,481
"I'm a human being."

21
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,284
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,

22
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:29,784
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark

23
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:33,136
where I shared the stage
with the writer Colum McCann.

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,470
We were discussing the role
of locality in writing,

25
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,673
when suddenly it hit me.

26
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,142
I'm not multinational.

27
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,162
I'm not a national at all.

28
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,558
How could I come from a nation?

29
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,340
How can a human being come from a concept?

30
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:55,038
It's a question that had been bothering me
for going on two decades.

31
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,576
From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,862
I had learned to speak of countries

33
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:05,649
as if they were eternal, singular,
naturally occurring things,

34
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:07,530
but I wondered:

35
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,326
to say that I came from a country

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,365
suggested that the country
was an absolute,

37
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,071
some fixed point in place in time,

38
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,443
a constant thing, but was it?

39
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:22,817
In my lifetime, countries
had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;

40
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:27,200
appeared -- Timor-Leste;
failed -- Somalia.

41
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:31,498
My parents came from countries
that didn't exist when they were born.

42
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:37,832
To me, a country -- this thing that could
be born, die, expand, contract --

43
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:41,277
hardly seemed the basis
for understanding a human being.

44
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:46,756
And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.

45
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,170
What we call countries are actually

46
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,843
various expressions
of sovereign statehood,

47
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:55,731
an idea that came into fashion
only 400 years ago.

48
00:02:56,295 --> 00:03:01,181
When I learned this, beginning my
masters degree in international relations,

49
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:03,574
I felt a sort of surge of relief.

50
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:05,844
It was as I had suspected.

51
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,023
History was real, cultures were real,

52
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,561
but countries were invented.

53
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:17,483
For the next 10 years, I sought
to re- or un-define myself,

54
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,975
my world, my work, my experience,

55
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,174
beyond the logic of the state.

56
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:26,737
In 2005, I wrote an essay,
"What is an Afropolitan,"

57
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:32,029
sketching out an identity
that privileged culture over country.

58
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:36,572
It was thrilling how many people
could relate to my experience,

59
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:41,573
and instructional how many others
didn't buy my sense of self.

60
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:47,224
"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"
one such critic asked,

61
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,516
"when she's never known the indignities

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,253
of traveling abroad
on a Ghanian passport?"

63
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:54,975
Now, if I'm honest,

64
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,431
I knew just what she meant.

65
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:00,448
I've got a friend named Layla
who was born and raised in Ghana.

66
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:05,014
Her parents are third-generation
Ghanians of Lebanese descent.

67
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:10,506
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
knows Accra like the back of her hand,

68
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,265
but when we first met years ago,
I thought, "She's not from Ghana."

69
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:18,235
In my mind, she came from Lebanon,

70
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,975
despite the patent fact
that all her formative experience

71
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,844
took place in suburban Accra.

72
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,718
I, like my critics,

73
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:32,272
was imagining some Ghana
where all Ghanaians had brown skin

74
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,807
or none held U.K. passports.

75
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,426
I'd fallen into the limiting trap

76
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,621
that the language of coming
from countries sets --

77
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:44,376
the privileging of a fiction,
the singular country,

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,609
over reality: human experience.

79
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:53,029
Speaking with Colum McCann that day,
the penny finally dropped.

80
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,177
"All experience is local," he said.

81
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:00,391
"All identity is experience," I thought.

82
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:04,297
"I'm not a national,"
I proclaimed onstage.

83
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,510
"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."

84
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:12,023
See, "Taiye Selasi comes
from the United States," isn't the truth.

85
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:15,229
I have no relationship
with the United States,

86
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,418
all 50 of them, not really.

87
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,614
My relationship is with Brookline,
the town where I grew up;

88
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,179
with New York City, where I started work;

89
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:26,987
with Lawrenceville,
where I spend Thanksgiving.

90
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:33,037
What makes America home for me
is not my passport or accent,

91
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,697
but these very particular experiences

92
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:37,679
and the places they occur.

93
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,807
Despite my pride in Ewe culture,

94
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:43,975
the Black Stars,
and my love of Ghanaian food,

95
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,357
I've never had a relationship
with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.

96
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:52,393
My relationship is with Accra,
where my mother lives,

97
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,028
where I go each year,

98
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:58,448
with the little garden in Dzorwulu
where my father and I talk for hours.

99
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,171
These are the places
that shape my experience.

100
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,956
My experience is where I'm from.

101
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,378
What if we asked, instead
of "Where are you from?" --

102
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,586
"Where are you a local?"

103
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,023
This would tell us so much more
about who and how similar we are.

104
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:20,631
Tell me you're from France,
and I see what, a set of clichés?

105
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:24,895
Adichie's dangerous single story,
the myth of the nation of France?

106
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:28,589
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,

107
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:32,978
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
a set of experiences.

108
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,975
Our experience is where we're from.

109
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,046
So, where are you a local?

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,141
I propose a three-step test.

111
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:46,262
I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.

112
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:50,533
First, think of your daily rituals,
whatever they may be:

113
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,590
making your coffee, driving to work,

114
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:55,490
harvesting your crops,
saying your prayers.

115
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,736
What kind of rituals are these?

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,213
Where do they occur?

117
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:03,876
In what city or cities in the world
do shopkeepers know your face?

118
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:08,975
As a child, I carried out fairly standard
suburban rituals in Boston,

119
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,630
with adjustments made for the rituals
my mother brought from London and Lagos.

120
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,501
We took off our shoes in the house,

121
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,215
we were unfailingly
polite with our elders,

122
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,476
we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.

123
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:25,561
In snowy North America,
ours were rituals of the global South.

124
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,975
The first time I went to Delhi
or to southern parts of Italy,

125
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,335
I was shocked by how at home I felt.

126
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,490
The rituals were familiar.

127
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,078
"R" number one, rituals.

128
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:41,692
Now, think of your relationships,
of the people who shape your days.

129
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,605
To whom do you speak at least once a week,

130
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,429
be it face to face or on FaceTime?

131
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,159
Be reasonable in your assessment;

132
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm not talking about
your Facebook friends.

133
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:56,347
I'm speaking of the people who shape
your weekly emotional experience.

134
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,975
My mother in Accra,
my twin sister in Boston,

135
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,041
my best friends in New York:

136
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,410
these relationships are home for me.

137
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:06,109
"R" number two, relationships.

138
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:10,975
We're local where we carry out
our rituals and relationships,

139
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,741
but how we experience our locality

140
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:17,051
depends in part on our restrictions.

141
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,918
By restrictions, I mean,
where are you able to live?

142
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,975
What passport do you hold?

143
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,266
Are you restricted by, say, racism,
from feeling fully at home where you live?

144
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,553
By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
economic inflation,

145
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,975
from living in the locality
where you had your rituals as a child?

146
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,993
This is the least sexy of the R’s,

147
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,975
less lyric than rituals and relationships,

148
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,309
but the question takes us past
"Where are you now?"

149
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,357
to "Why aren't you there, and why?"

150
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,011
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.

151
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,028
Take a piece of paper

152
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:57,344
and put those three words
on top of three columns,

153
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:00,684
then try to fill those columns
as honestly as you can.

154
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,202
A very different picture
of your life in local context,

155
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:08,640
of your identity as a set of experiences,

156
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:09,824
may emerge.

157
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,064
So let's try it.

158
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:12,853
I have a friend named Olu.

159
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:14,472
He's 35 years old.

160
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:18,441
His parents, born in Nigeria,
came to Germany on scholarships.

161
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:22,026
Olu was born in Nuremberg
and lived there until age 10.

162
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,843
When his family moved to Lagos,
he studied in London,

163
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,292
then came to Berlin.

164
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,975
He loves going to Nigeria --

165
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,633
the weather, the food, the friends --

166
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,171
but hates the political corruption there.

167
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:35,855
Where is Olu from?

168
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:38,617
I have another friend named Udo.

169
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,148
He's also 35 years old.

170
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:43,823
Udo was born in Córdoba,
in northwest Argentina,

171
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:47,035
where his grandparents migrated
from Germany, what is now Poland,

172
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,487
after the war.

173
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,393
Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
and nine years ago came to Berlin.

174
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:56,618
He loves going to Argentina --
the weather, the food, the friends --

175
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:59,102
but hates the economic corruption there.

176
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,405
Where is Udo from?

177
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:05,062
With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
Udo could pass for German,

178
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:09,142
but holds an Argentinian passport,
so needs a visa to live in Berlin.

179
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,475
That Udo is from Argentina
has largely to do with history.

180
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,656
That he's a local
of Buenos Aires and Berlin,

181
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,465
that has to do with life.

182
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:22,975
Olu, who looks Nigerian,
needs a visa to visit Nigeria.

183
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,390
He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,

184
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:27,493
and English with a German one.

185
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:30,058
To claim that he's
"not really Nigerian," though,

186
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,410
denies his experience in Lagos,

187
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,617
the rituals he practiced growing up,

188
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:37,070
his relationship with family and friends.

189
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:41,452
Meanwhile, though Lagos
is undoubtedly one of his homes,

190
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:43,975
Olu always feels restricted there,

191
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,268
not least by the fact that he's gay.

192
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:50,950
Both he and Udo are restricted
by the political conditions

193
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,628
of their parents' countries,

194
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,636
from living where some of their
most meaningful rituals

195
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,610
and relationships occur.

196
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:01,735
To say Olu is from Nigeria
and Udo is from Argentina

197
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,872
distracts from their common experience.

198
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,511
Their rituals, their relationships,
and their restrictions are the same.

199
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:10,560
Of course, when we ask,
"Where are you from?"

200
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,505
we're using a kind of shorthand.

201
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,456
It's quicker to say "Nigeria"
than "Lagos and Berlin,"

202
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,747
and as with Google Maps,
we can always zoom in closer,

203
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:23,231
from country to city to neighborhood.

204
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:25,548
But that's not quite the point.

205
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,899
The difference between
"Where are you from?"

206
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,439
and "Where are you a local?"

207
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:33,425
isn't the specificity of the answer;

208
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:35,564
it's the intention of the question.

209
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,181
Replacing the language of nationality
with the language of locality asks us

210
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:44,897
to shift our focus
to where real life occurs.

211
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:49,566
Even that most glorious expression
of countryhood, the World Cup,

212
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,286
gives us national teams comprised
mostly of multilocal players.

213
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,176
As a unit of measurement
for human experience,

214
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,975
the country doesn't quite work.

215
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,852
That's why Olu says, "I'm German,
but my parents come from Nigeria."

216
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:10,605
The "but" in that sentence
belies the inflexibility of the units,

217
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,767
one fixed and fictional entity
bumping up against another.

218
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:19,586
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"
suggests overlapping experiences,

219
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,835
layers that merge together,
that can't be denied or removed.

220
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,408
You can take away my passport,

221
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,539
but you can't take away my experience.

222
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:30,674
That I carry within me.

223
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:33,340
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.

224
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,620
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
that we do away with countries.

225
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,778
There's much to be said
for national history,

226
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:41,764
more for the sovereign state.

227
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:46,485
Culture exists in community,
and community exists in context.

228
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,475
Geography, tradition, collective memory:
these things are important.

229
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:53,514
What I'm questioning is primacy.

230
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:58,663
All of those introductions on tour
began with reference to nation,

231
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:03,010
as if knowing what country I came
from would tell my audience who I was.

232
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,415
What are we really seeking, though,
when we ask where someone comes from?

233
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:10,380
And what are we really seeing
when we hear an answer?

234
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,270
Here's one possibility:

235
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:15,064
basically, countries represent power.

236
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:20,163
"Where are you from?"
Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.

237
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:24,165
America. Germany. Japan. More power.

238
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:27,076
China. Russia. Ambiguous.

239
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,363
(Laughter)

240
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:33,048
It's possible that without realizing it,
we're playing a power game,

241
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:36,413
especially in the context
of multi-ethnic countries.

242
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:38,706
As any recent immigrant knows,

243
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:42,975
the question "Where are you from?"
or "Where are you really from?"

244
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,468
is often code for "Why are you here?"

245
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:49,436
Then we have the scholar
William Deresiewicz's writing

246
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,233
of elite American colleges.

247
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:54,408
"Students think that
their environment is diverse

248
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:57,687
if one comes from Missouri
and another from Pakistan --

249
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,749
never mind that all of their parents
are doctors or bankers."

250
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:03,273
I'm with him.

251
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:06,768
To call one student American,
another Pakistani,

252
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:10,053
then triumphantly claim
student body diversity

253
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:13,720
ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.

254
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:17,093
The same holds true on the other end
of the economic spectrum.

255
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:22,265
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi

256
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,112
have more in common
in terms of rituals and restrictions

257
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:27,922
than nationality implies.

258
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:31,541
Perhaps my biggest problem
with coming from countries

259
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:33,279
is the myth of going back to them.

260
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:36,398
I'm often asked if I plan
to "go back" to Ghana.

261
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:40,742
I go to Accra every year,
but I can't "go back" to Ghana.

262
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,567
It's not because I wasn't born there.

263
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,924
My father can't go back, either.

264
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,975
The country in which he was born,

265
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,333
that country no longer exists.

266
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:53,192
We can never go back to a place
and find it exactly where we left it.

267
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:56,064
Something, somewhere
will always have changed,

268
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,984
most of all, ourselves.

269
00:14:58,738 --> 00:14:59,960
People.

270
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:02,532
Finally, what we're talking
about is human experience,

271
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:06,419
this notoriously and gloriously
disorderly affair.

272
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:10,286
In creative writing,
locality bespeaks humanity.

273
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,587
The more we know
about where a story is set,

274
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,975
the more local color and texture,

275
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,476
the more human
the characters start to feel,

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,776
the more relatable, not less.

277
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,244
The myth of national identity
and the vocabulary of coming from

278
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:29,230
confuses us into placing ourselves
into mutually exclusive categories.

279
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:33,559
In fact, all of us are multi --
multi-local, multi-layered.

280
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,367
To begin our conversations
with an acknowledgement of this complexity

281
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:40,972
brings us closer together, I think,
not further apart.

282
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:44,298
So the next time that I'm introduced,

283
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:46,171
I'd love to hear the truth:

284
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,202
"Taiye Selasi is a human being,
like everybody here.

285
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:54,284
She isn't a citizen of the world,
but a citizen of worlds.

286
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:57,069
She is a local of New York,
Rome and Accra."

287
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,572
Thank you.

288
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:02,999
(Applause)
