00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:16,643
One hot October morning,

1
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,377
I got off the all-night train

2
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,559
in Mandalay,

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,701
the old royal capital of Burma,

4
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,142
now Myanmar.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,858
And out on the street, I ran into
a group of rough men

6
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:33,775
standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.

7
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,169
And one of them came up

8
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:37,375
and offered to show me around.

9
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:41,279
The price he quoted was outrageous.

10
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:45,820
It was less than I would pay
for a bar of chocolate at home.

11
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:48,985
So I clambered into his trishaw,

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:54,880
and he began pedaling us slowly
between palaces and pagodas.

13
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:01,271
And as he did, he told me how
he had come to the city from his village.

14
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,674
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.

15
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,025
His dream was to be a teacher.

16
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:11,257
But of course, life is hard
under a military dictatorship,

17
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:15,401
and so for now, this was the only way
he could make a living.

18
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:20,737
Many nights, he told me,
he actually slept in his trishaw

19
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:25,147
so he could catch the first visitors
off the all-night train.

20
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:31,392
And very soon, we found
that in certain ways,

21
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,082
we had so much in common --

22
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,967
we were both in our 20s,

23
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,203
we were both fascinated
by foreign cultures --

24
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:40,658
that he invited me home.

25
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,863
So we turned off the wide,
crowded streets,

26
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:50,097
and we began bumping
down rough, wild alleyways.

27
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,469
There were broken shacks all around.

28
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:55,335
I really lost the sense of where I was,

29
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:59,818
and I realized that anything
could happen to me now.

30
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:02,284
I could get mugged or drugged

31
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,624
or something worse.

32
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,032
Nobody would know.

33
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:10,006
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,354
which consisted of just one tiny room.

35
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,405
And then he leaned down,

36
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,371
and reached under his bed.

37
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,786
And something in me froze.

38
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:26,746
I waited to see what he would pull out.

39
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,371
And finally he extracted a box.

40
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:36,226
Inside it was every single letter
he had ever received

41
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,291
from visitors from abroad,

42
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,103
and on some of them he had pasted

43
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,518
little black-and-white worn snapshots

44
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,746
of his new foreign friends.

45
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:52,014
So when we said goodbye that night,

46
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,625
I realized he had also shown me

47
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,959
the secret point of travel,

48
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:59,039
which is to take a plunge,

49
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,755
to go inwardly as well as outwardly

50
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,294
to places you would never go otherwise,

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,498
to venture into uncertainty,

52
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,101
ambiguity,

53
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,780
even fear.

54
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,737
At home, it's dangerously easy

55
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,971
to assume we're on top of things.

56
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,822
Out in the world, you are reminded
every moment that you're not,

57
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:24,855
and you can't get to the bottom
of things, either.

58
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:29,137
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,"

59
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,440
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,

60
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,140
"but only insofar
as we are unsettled

61
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:35,850
is there any hope for us."

62
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,318
At this conference,
we've been lucky enough

63
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,795
to hear some exhilarating
new ideas and discoveries

64
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,575
and, really, about all the ways

65
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,922
in which knowledge is being
pushed excitingly forwards.

66
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:52,026
But at some point, knowledge gives out.

67
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:54,026
And that is the moment

68
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,685
when your life is truly decided:

69
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,507
you fall in love;

70
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,928
you lose a friend;

71
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:04,465
the lights go out.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,014
And it's then, when you're lost
or uneasy or carried out of yourself,

73
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:12,200
that you find out who you are.

74
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:17,552
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.

75
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:21,324
Science has unquestionably made our lives

76
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,816
brighter and longer and healthier.

77
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:29,652
And I am forever grateful to the teachers
who showed me the laws of physics

78
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:33,189
and pointed out that
three times three makes nine.

79
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:36,503
I can count that out on my fingers

80
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,869
any time of night or day.

81
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,414
But when a mathematician tells me

82
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:45,961
that minus three times
minus three makes nine,

83
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,854
that's a kind of logic
that almost feels like trust.

84
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:56,435
The opposite of knowledge, in other words,
isn't always ignorance.

85
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,098
It can be wonder.

86
00:04:58,482 --> 00:04:59,632
Or mystery.

87
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,147
Possibility.

88
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:05,731
And in my life, I've found
it's the things I don't know

89
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,434
that have lifted me up
and pushed me forwards

90
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,026
much more than the things I do know.

91
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:14,021
It's also the things I don't know

92
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:17,439
that have often brought me closer
to everybody around me.

93
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,549
For eight straight Novembers, recently,

94
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:25,001
I traveled every year across Japan
with the Dalai Lama.

95
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,101
And the one thing he said every day

96
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,672
that most seemed to give people
reassurance and confidence

97
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,754
was, "I don't know."

98
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:38,202
"What's going to happen to Tibet?"

99
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:42,206
"When are we ever
going to get world peace?"

100
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,826
"What's the best way to raise children?"

101
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:49,205
"Frankly," says this very wise man,

102
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,466
"I don't know."

103
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:55,818
The Nobel Prize-winning
economist Daniel Kahneman

104
00:05:55,842 --> 00:06:00,345
has spent more than 60 years now
researching human behavior,

105
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,401
and his conclusion is

106
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:07,039
that we are always much more confident
of what we think we know

107
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:08,788
than we should be.

108
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:11,471
We have, as he memorably puts it,

109
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:15,699
an "unlimited ability
to ignore our ignorance."

110
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:21,936
We know -- quote, unquote -- our team
is going to win this weekend,

111
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,129
and we only remember that knowledge

112
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,502
on the rare occasions when we're right.

113
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:30,425
Most of the time, we're in the dark.

114
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,794
And that's where real intimacy lies.

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,513
Do you know what your lover
is going to do tomorrow?

116
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:41,946
Do you want to know?

117
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,434
The parents of us all,
as some people call them,

118
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,617
Adam and Eve,

119
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,799
could never die, so long as they
were eating from the tree of life.

120
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,829
But the minute they began nibbling

121
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:57,435
from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

122
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,263
they fell from their innocence.

123
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,833
They grew embarrassed and fretful,

124
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,054
self-conscious.

125
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:07,233
And they learned,
a little too late, perhaps,

126
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:09,997
that there are certainly some things
that we need to know,

127
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,968
but there are many, many more
that are better left unexplored.

128
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,924
Now, when I was a kid,

129
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:21,266
I knew it all, of course.

130
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,502
I had been spending 20 years
in classrooms collecting facts,

131
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:28,245
and I was actually
in the information business,

132
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,419
writing articles for Time Magazine.

133
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,305
And I took my first real trip to Japan
for two-and-a-half weeks,

134
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:39,609
and I came back with a 40-page essay

135
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,197
explaining every last detail
about Japan's temples,

136
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,903
its fashions, its baseball games,

137
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,649
its soul.

138
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:51,606
But underneath all that,

139
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,807
something that I couldn't understand

140
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:59,325
so moved me for reasons
I couldn't explain to you yet,

141
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,296
that I decided to go and live in Japan.

142
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,201
And now that I've been there for 28 years,

143
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,625
I really couldn't tell you
very much at all

144
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,313
about my adopted home.

145
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,569
Which is wonderful,

146
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,473
because it means every day
I'm making some new discovery,

147
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,988
and in the process,

148
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:21,906
looking around the corner
and seeing the hundred thousand things

149
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,231
I'll never know.

150
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,430
Knowledge is a priceless gift.

151
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:33,007
But the illusion of knowledge
can be more dangerous than ignorance.

152
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,528
Thinking that you know your lover

153
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,272
or your enemy

154
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,076
can be more treacherous

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,548
than acknowledging you'll never know them.

156
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:48,409
Every morning in Japan, as the sun
is flooding into our little apartment,

157
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:52,791
I take great pains not to consult
the weather forecast,

158
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,453
because if I do,

159
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:57,740
my mind will be overclouded, distracted,

160
00:08:57,764 --> 00:09:00,278
even when the day is bright.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,353
I've been a full-time
writer now for 34 years.

162
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:09,696
And the one thing that I have learned

163
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,256
is that transformation comes
when I'm not in charge,

164
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,457
when I don't know what's coming next,

165
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:20,008
when I can't assume I am bigger
than everything around me.

166
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,097
And the same is true in love

167
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,919
or in moments of crisis.

168
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,371
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again

169
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:34,430
and we're bumping off the broad,
well-lit streets;

170
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:38,118
and we're reminded, really,
of the first law of travel

171
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,868
and, therefore, of life:

172
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,829
you're only as strong
as your readiness to surrender.

173
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,521
In the end, perhaps,

174
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,739
being human

175
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,015
is much more important

176
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,694
than being fully in the know.

177
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,949
