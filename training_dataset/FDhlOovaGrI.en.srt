0
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,881
Imagine that you invented a device

1
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:16,577
that can record my memories,

2
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,638
my dreams, my ideas,

3
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,325
and transmit them to your brain.

4
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:23,830
That would be a game-changing
technology, right?

5
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:26,892
But in fact, we already
possess this device,

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,560
and it's called human communication system

7
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:31,432
and effective storytelling.

8
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:34,334
To understand how this device works,

9
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:36,773
we have to look into our brains.

10
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:40,383
And we have to formulate the question
in a slightly different manner.

11
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,870
Now we have to ask

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,925
how these neuron patterns in my brain

13
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,151
that are associated
with my memories and ideas

14
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,694
are transmitted into your brains.

15
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:55,070
And we think there are two factors
that enable us to communicate.

16
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:59,149
First, your brain is now
physically coupled to the sound wave

17
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,648
that I'm transmitting to your brain.

18
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:05,050
And second, we developed
a common neural protocol

19
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,832
that enabled us to communicate.

20
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,721
So how do we know that?

21
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,185
In my lab in Princeton,

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,714
we bring people to the fMRI scanner
and we scan their brains

23
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:18,638
while they are either telling
or listening to real-life stories.

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,286
And to give you a sense
of the stimulus we are using,

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,294
let me play 20 seconds
from a story that we used,

26
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,642
told by a very talented storyteller,

27
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,817
Jim O'Grady.

28
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:33,577
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out
my story and I know it's good,

29
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,891
and then I start to make it better --

30
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,399
(Laughter)

31
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:40,758
by adding an element of embellishment.

32
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,810
Reporters call this "making shit up."

33
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:47,105
(Laughter)

34
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,851
And they recommend
against crossing that line.

35
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:56,812
But I had just seen the line crossed
between a high-powered dean

36
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:58,262
and assault with a pastry.

37
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,778
And I kinda liked it."

38
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:02,176
Uri Hasson: OK, so now
let's look into your brain

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,428
and see what's happening
when you listen to these kinds of stories.

40
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:09,496
And let's start simple -- let's start
with one listener and one brain area:

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,009
the auditory cortex that processes
the sounds that come from the ear.

42
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,477
And as you can see,
in this particular brain area,

43
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,993
the responses are going up and down
as the story is unfolding.

44
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,610
Now we can take these responses

45
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:23,435
and compare them to the responses
in other listeners

46
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,934
in the same brain area.

47
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,125
And we can ask:

48
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:29,384
How similar are the responses
across all listeners?

49
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,380
So here you can see five listeners.

50
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:36,436
And we start to scan their brains
before the story starts,

51
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,999
when they're simply lying in the dark
and waiting for the story to begin.

52
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:41,177
As you can see,

53
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,959
the brain area is going up and down
in each one of them,

54
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,758
but the responses are very different,

55
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,449
and not in sync.

56
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:50,179
However, immediately
as the story is starting,

57
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,889
something amazing is happening.

58
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:55,786
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story
and I know it's good,

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,338
and then I start to make it --

60
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:00,659
UH: Suddenly, you can see
that the responses in all of the subjects

61
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,835
lock to the story,

62
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:05,288
and now they are going up and down
in a very similar way

63
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:06,866
across all listeners.

64
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,939
And in fact, this is exactly
what is happening now in your brains

65
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:12,836
when you listen to my sound speaking.

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,868
We call this effect "neural entrainment."

67
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,686
And to explain to you
what is neural entrainment,

68
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,320
let me first explain
what is physical entrainment.

69
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,826
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.

70
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,846
Think of these five metronomes
as five brains.

71
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,620
And similar to the listeners
before the story starts,

72
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,457
these metronomes are going to click,

73
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,640
but they're going to click out of phase.

74
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:39,455
(Clicking)

75
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,480
Now see what will happen
when I connect them together

76
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,645
by placing them on these two cylinders.

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,101
(Clicking)

78
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,737
Now these two cylinders start to rotate.

79
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,890
This rotation vibration
is going through the wood

80
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:57,919
and is going to couple
all the metronomes together.

81
00:03:57,943 --> 00:03:59,555
And now listen to the click.

82
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,246
(Synchronized clicking)

83
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,458
This is what you call
physical entrainment.

84
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,725
Now let's go back to the brain and ask:

85
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:16,893
What's driving this neural entrainment?

86
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,702
Is it simply the sounds
that the speaker is producing?

87
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,049
Or maybe it's the words.

88
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:24,719
Or maybe it's the meaning
that the speaker is trying to convey.

89
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,503
So to test it, we did
the following experiment.

90
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:30,728
First, we took the story
and played it backwards.

91
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:33,878
And that preserved many
of the original auditory features,

92
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,915
but removed the meaning.

93
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,610
And it sounds something like that.

94
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:42,772
(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)

95
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,648
And we flashed colors in the two brains

96
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:49,584
to indicate brain areas that respond
very similarly across people.

97
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:50,762
And as you can see,

98
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:54,554
this incoming sound induced entrainment
or alignment in all of the brains

99
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,310
in auditory cortices
that process the sounds,

100
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,558
but it didn't spread
deeper into the brain.

101
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:03,455
Now we can take these sounds
and build words out of it.

102
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,135
So if we take Jim O'Grady
and scramble the words,

103
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,399
we'll get a list of words.

104
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,685
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...
assorted facts ...

105
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,601
and right on ... pie man ...
potentially ... my stories

106
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,567
UH: And you can see that these words
start to induce alignment

107
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,196
in early language areas,
but not more than that.

108
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,037
Now we can take the words
and start to build sentences out of them.

109
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,561
(Audio) JO: And they recommend
against crossing that line.

110
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:31,663
He says: "Dear Jim,
Good story. Nice details.

111
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,521
Didn't she only know
about him through me?"

112
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:37,680
UH: Now you can see that the responses
in all the language areas

113
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,395
that process the incoming language

114
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,798
become aligned or similar
across all listeners.

115
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:46,895
However, only when we use
the full, engaging, coherent story

116
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,144
do the responses spread
deeper into the brain

117
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,699
into higher-order areas,

118
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,824
which include the frontal cortex
and the parietal cortex,

119
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:56,436
and make all of them
respond very similarly.

120
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,729
And we believe that these responses
in higher-order areas are induced

121
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,879
or become similar across listeners

122
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,643
because of the meaning
conveyed by the speaker,

123
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,268
and not by words or sound.

124
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:09,350
And if we are right,
there's a strong prediction over here

125
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,736
if I tell you the exact same ideas

126
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,404
using two very different sets of words,

127
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:16,979
your brain responses
will still be similar.

128
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,513
And to test it, we did
the following experiment in my lab.

129
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:22,950
We took the English story

130
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:25,110
and translated it to Russian.

131
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:29,358
Now you have two different sounds
and linguistic systems

132
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,676
that convey the exact same meaning.

133
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,348
And you play the English story
to the English listeners

134
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,724
and the Russian story
to the Russian listeners,

135
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,793
and we can compare their responses
across the groups.

136
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,388
And when we did that, we didn't see
responses that are similar

137
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,693
in auditory cortices in language,

138
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:49,095
because the language
and sound are very different.

139
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,887
However, you can see
that the responses in high-order areas

140
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:54,415
were still similar
across these two groups.

141
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:59,160
We believe this is because they understood
the story in a very similar way,

142
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:03,210
as we confirmed, using a test
after the story ended.

143
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:08,008
And we think that this alignment
is necessary for communication.

144
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,658
For example, as you can tell,

145
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:12,709
I am not a native English speaker.

146
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,614
I grew up with another language,

147
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:17,292
and the same might be for many
of you in the audience.

148
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,315
And still, we can communicate.

149
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,490
How come?

150
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:23,593
We think we can communicate
because we have this common code

151
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,044
that presents meaning.

152
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:29,367
So far, I've only talked about
what's happening in the listener's brain,

153
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,638
in your brain, when
you're listening to talks.

154
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:34,361
But what's happening
in the speaker's brain, in my brain,

155
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:36,192
when I'm speaking to you?

156
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,073
To look in the speaker's brain,

157
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:41,193
we asked the speaker
to go into the scanner,

158
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,819
we scan his brain

159
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:46,850
and then compare his brain responses
to the brain responses of the listeners

160
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,676
listening to the story.

161
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,910
You have to remember that producing speech
and comprehending speech

162
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,657
are very different processes.

163
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,925
Here we're asking: How similar are they?

164
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,571
To our surprise,

165
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:04,466
we saw that all these complex
patterns within the listeners

166
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,197
actually came from the speaker brain.

167
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,906
So production and comprehension
rely on very similar processes.

168
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,502
And we also found

169
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:16,232
the stronger the similarity
between the listener's brain

170
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,755
and the speaker's brain,

171
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,684
the better the communication.

172
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,673
So I know that if you
are completely confused now,

173
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,718
and I do hope that this is not the case,

174
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:28,135
your brain responses
are very different than mine.

175
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,266
But I also know that if you really
understand me now,

176
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,181
then your brain ... and your brain
... and your brain

177
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,933
are really similar to mine.

178
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:40,888
Now, let's take all
this information together and ask:

179
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:44,249
How can we use it to transmit
a memory that I have

180
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,459
from my brain to your brains?

181
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,155
So we did the following experiment.

182
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:52,221
We let people watch,
for the first time in their life,

183
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:56,379
a TV episode from the BBC series
"Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.

184
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,204
And then we asked them
to go back to the scanner

185
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:03,127
and tell the story to another person
that never watched the movie.

186
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,811
So let's be specific.

187
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,882
Think about this exact scene,

188
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,490
when Sherlock is entering
the cab in London

189
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,810
driven by the murderer he is looking for.

190
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,894
With me, as a viewer,

191
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:18,418
there is a specific brain pattern
in my brain when I watch it.

192
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,951
Now, the exact same pattern,
I can reactivate in my brain again

193
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:26,631
by telling the word:
Sherlock, London, murderer.

194
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,479
And when I'm transmitting
these words to your brains now,

195
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,988
you have to reconstruct it in your mind.

196
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:37,561
In fact, we see that pattern
emerging now in your brains.

197
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,100
And we were really surprised to see

198
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:42,379
that the pattern you have
now in your brains

199
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:44,315
when I'm describing to you these scenes

200
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,161
would be very similar to the pattern
I had when I watched this movie

201
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,323
a few months ago in the scanner.

202
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,451
This starts to tell you
about the mechanism

203
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:55,217
by which we can tell stories
and transmit information.

204
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,609
Because, for example,

205
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:01,145
now you're listening really hard
and trying to understand what I'm saying.

206
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,719
And I know that it's not easy.

207
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:06,779
But I hope that at one point
in the talk we clicked, and you got me.

208
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:10,701
And I think that in a few hours,
a few days, a few months,

209
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,869
you're going to meet someone at a party,

210
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:16,441
and you're going to tell him
about this lecture,

211
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:20,103
and suddenly it will be as if
he is standing now here with us.

212
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,977
Now you can see
how we can take this mechanism

213
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,932
and try to transmit memories
and knowledge across people,

214
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,003
which is wonderful, right?

215
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:32,194
But our ability to communicate
relies on our ability

216
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,784
to have common ground.

217
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,013
Because, for example,

218
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:39,804
if I'm going to use the British synonym

219
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:42,206
"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"

220
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,269
I know that I'm going to be misaligned
with most of you in the audience.

221
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,911
This alignment depends
not only on our ability

222
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,969
to understand the basic concept;

223
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:55,788
it also depends on our ability to develop
common ground and understanding

224
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,599
and shared belief systems.

225
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,457
Because we know that in many cases,

226
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:03,524
people understand the exact
same story in very different ways.

227
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,501
So to test it in the lab,
we did the following experiment.

228
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,020
We took a story by J.D. Salinger,

229
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:15,379
in which a husband lost track
of his wife in the middle of a party,

230
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:19,090
and he's calling his best friend, asking,
"Did you see my wife?"

231
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,043
For half of the subjects,

232
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:25,208
we said that the wife was having
an affair with the best friend.

233
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:26,383
For the other half,

234
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:31,512
we said that the wife is loyal
and the husband is very jealous.

235
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,815
This one sentence before the story started

236
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,140
was enough to make the brain responses

237
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,208
of all the people that believed
the wife was having an affair

238
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,669
be very similar in these high-order areas

239
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,915
and different than the other group.

240
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:48,612
And if one sentence is enough
to make your brain similar

241
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,239
to people that think like you

242
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:53,216
and very different than people
that think differently than you,

243
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,717
think how this effect is going
to be amplified in real life,

244
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,633
when we are all listening
to the exact same news item

245
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:03,405
after being exposed
day after day after day

246
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:07,241
to different media channels,
like Fox News or The New York Times,

247
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,378
that give us very different
perspectives on reality.

248
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,909
So let me summarize.

249
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,618
If everything worked as planned tonight,

250
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:19,941
I used my ability to vocalize sound
to be coupled to your brains.

251
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,468
And I used this coupling

252
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:25,333
to transmit my brain patterns associated
with my memories and ideas

253
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,673
into your brains.

254
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:30,999
In this, I start to reveal
the hidden neural mechanism

255
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,658
by which we communicate.

256
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:35,649
And we know that in the future
it will enable us to improve

257
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,663
and facilitate communication.

258
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,805
But these studies also reveal

259
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,821
that communication relies
on a common ground.

260
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:46,307
And we have to be
really worried as a society

261
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:50,367
if we lose this common ground
and our ability to speak with people

262
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,508
that are slightly different than us

263
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:55,920
because we let a few very strong
media channels

264
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:57,485
take control of the mic,

265
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,284
and manipulate and control
the way we all think.

266
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:04,209
And I'm not sure how to fix it
because I'm only a scientist.

267
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,693
But maybe one way to do it

268
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,364
is to go back to the more
natural way of communication,

269
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,990
which is a dialogue,

270
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,521
in which it's not only me
speaking to you now,

271
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,210
but a more natural way of talking,

272
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,511
in which I am speaking and I am listening,

273
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:24,255
and together we are trying to come
to a common ground and new ideas.

274
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,437
Because after all,

275
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:29,125
the people we are coupled to
define who we are.

276
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,538
And our desire to be coupled
to another brain

277
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:36,079
is something very basic
that starts at a very early age.

278
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:40,290
So let me finish with an example
from my own private life

279
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:45,355
that I think is a good example
of how coupling to other people

280
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,653
is really going to define who we are.

281
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,368
This my son Jonathan at a very early age.

282
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:55,542
See how he developed
a vocal game together with my wife,

283
00:13:55,566 --> 00:14:00,797
only from the desire and pure joy
of being coupled to another human being.

284
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:06,473
(Both vocalizing)

285
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:17,243
(Laughter)

286
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:21,064
Now, think how the ability of my son

287
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,850
to be coupled to us
and other people in his life

288
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,732
is going to shape the man
he is going to become.

289
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:29,171
And think how you change on a daily basis

290
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:33,518
from the interaction and coupling
to other people in your life.

291
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,665
So keep being coupled to other people.

292
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,706
Keep spreading your ideas,

293
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,974
because the sum of all of us
together, coupled,

294
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,592
is greater than our parts.

295
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,782
Thank you.

296
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:50,468
(Applause)
