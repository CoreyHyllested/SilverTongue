0
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:18,518
If you want to buy high-quality,
low-price cocaine,

1
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,379
there really is only one place to go,

2
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:24,882
and that is the dark net
anonymous markets.

3
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:27,288
Now, you can't get to these sites

4
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:31,775
with a normal browser --
Chrome or Firefox --

5
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,932
because they're on this
hidden part of the Internet,

6
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,058
known as Tor hidden services,

7
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:41,775
where URLs are a string of meaningless
numbers and letters that end in .onion,

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,605
and which you access
with a special browser

9
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,074
called the Tor browser.

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,375
Now, the Tor browser was originally
a U.S. Naval intelligence project.

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,280
It then became open source,

12
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,891
and it allows anybody to browse the net

13
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:58,367
without giving away their location.

14
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:02,495
And it does this
by encrypting your IP address

15
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,295
and then routing it via several
other computers around the world

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,658
that use the same software.

17
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:11,775
You can use it on the normal Internet,

18
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,514
but it's also your key to the dark net.

19
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,508
And because of this fiendishly
clever encryption system,

20
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:24,951
the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --
thousand sites that operate there

21
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:28,182
are incredibly difficult to shut down.

22
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:34,095
It is a censorship-free world
visited by anonymous users.

23
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:39,586
Little wonder, then,
that it's a natural place to go

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,522
for anybody with something to hide,

25
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:46,137
and that something, of course,
need not be illegal.

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,638
On the dark net, you will find

27
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:50,900
whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.

28
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,711
You will find political activism blogs.

29
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,843
You will find libraries of pirated books.

30
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,490
But you'll also find the drugs markets,

31
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:04,619
illegal pornography,
commercial hacking services,

32
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,240
and much more besides.

33
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:12,074
Now, the dark net is one of the most
interesting, exciting places

34
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,775
anywhere on the net.

35
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,475
And the reason is, because
although innovation, of course,

36
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,775
takes place in big businesses,

37
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,198
takes place in world-class universities,

38
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,775
it also takes place in the fringes,

39
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,342
because those on the fringes --
the pariahs, the outcasts --

40
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,603
they're often the most creative,
because they have to be.

41
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:36,052
In this part of the Internet,

42
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,355
you will not find a single lolcat,

43
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,560
a single pop-up advert anywhere.

44
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,862
And that's one of the reasons why I think

45
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:47,575
many of you here will be
on the dark net fairly soon.

46
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,599
(Laughter)

47
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:53,469
Not that I'm suggesting
anyone in this audience would use it

48
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,770
to go and procure high-quality narcotics.

49
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:58,390
But let's say for a moment that you were.

50
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,987
(Laughter)

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,591
Bear with me.

52
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:07,444
The first thing you will notice
on signing up to one of these sites

53
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,053
is how familiar it looks.

54
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,265
Every single product --

55
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,153
thousands of products --

56
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:19,193
has a glossy, high-res image,

57
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,065
a detailed product description, a price.

58
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,494
There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.

59
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:28,276
There is even, most beautifully of all,

60
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,458
a "Report this item" button.

61
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:33,189
(Laughter)

62
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,139
Incredible.

63
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,550
You browse through the site,
you make your choice,

64
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:39,993
you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,

65
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:43,046
you enter an address --
preferably not your home address --

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,775
and you wait for your product
to arrive in the post,

67
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,662
which it nearly always does.

68
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:53,139
And the reason it does
is not because of the clever encryption.

69
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:54,328
That's important.

70
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:58,003
Something far simpler than that.

71
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,252
It's the user reviews.

72
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,259
(Laughter)

73
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,054
You see, every single vendor
on these sites

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,396
uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,

75
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,213
but they keep the same pseudonym
to build up a reputation.

76
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,910
And because it's easy for the buyer
to change allegiance whenever they want,

77
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:21,207
the only way of trusting a vendor

78
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,869
is if they have a good history
of positive feedback

79
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:26,483
from other users of the site.

80
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:31,873
And this introduction
of competition and choice

81
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:36,166
does exactly what
the economists would predict.

82
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:42,032
Prices tend to go down,
product quality tends to go up,

83
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,429
and the vendors are attentive,

84
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,884
they're polite, they're consumer-centric,

85
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:51,220
offering you all manner
of special deals, one-offs,

86
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:54,415
buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,

87
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,623
to keep you happy.

88
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,871
I spoke to Drugsheaven.

89
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:05,785
Drugsheaven was offering
excellent and consistent marijuana

90
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,351
at a reasonable price.

91
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:11,963
He had a very generous refund policy,

92
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,775
detailed T's and C's,

93
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,211
and good shipping times.

94
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,869
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,

95
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:21,707
via the internal emailing system
that's also encrypted, of course.

96
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:26,538
"I'm new here. Do you mind
if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"

97
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,574
A couple of hours later, I get a reply.

98
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:30,784
They always reply.

99
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,026
"Hi there, thanks for your email.

100
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:39,422
Starting small is a wise thing to do.
I would, too, if I were you."

101
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,208
(Laughter)

102
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:44,353
"So no problem if you'd like to start
with just one gram.

103
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,888
I do hope we can do business together.

104
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,775
Best wishes, Drugsheaven."

105
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,775
(Laughter)

106
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:54,063
I don't know why he had a posh
English accent, but I assume he did.

107
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,775
Now, this kind
of consumer-centric attitude

108
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:06,235
is the reason why, when I reviewed
120,000 pieces of feedback

109
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:10,239
that had been left on one of these sites
over a three-month period,

110
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:13,392
95 percent of them were five out of five.

111
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,104
The customer, you see, is king.

112
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,009
But what does that mean?

113
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:20,974
Well, on the one hand,

114
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:25,032
that means there are more drugs,
more available, more easily,

115
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:26,207
to more people.

116
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,729
And by my reckoning,
that is not a good thing.

117
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:34,512
But, on the other hand,
if you are going to take drugs,

118
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,597
you have a reasonably good way

119
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:42,035
of guaranteeing a certain level
of purity and quality,

120
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:45,775
which is incredibly important
if you're taking drugs.

121
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,917
And you can do so
from the comfort of your own home,

122
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:53,128
without the risks associated
with buying on the streets.

123
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,437
Now, as I said,

124
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,563
you've got to be creative and innovative
to survive in this marketplace.

125
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,371
And the 20 or so sites
that are currently in operation --

126
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:07,100
by the way, they don't always work,
they're not always perfect;

127
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,726
the site that I showed you
was shut down 18 months ago,

128
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,901
but not before it had turned
over a billion dollars' worth of trade.

129
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,623
But these markets,

130
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,709
because of the difficult conditions
in which they are operating,

131
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,221
the inhospitable conditions,

132
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:26,593
are always innovating, always
thinking of ways of getting smarter,

133
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,855
more decentralized, harder to censor,

134
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,235
and more customer-friendly.

135
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,775
Let's take the payment system.

136
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,181
You don't pay with your credit card,

137
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,550
of course -- that would lead
directly back to you.

138
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,551
So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,

139
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:45,030
which is easily exchanged
for real-world currencies

140
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:48,799
and gives quite a high degree
of anonymity to its users.

141
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,294
But at the beginning of these sites,
people noticed a flaw.

142
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:56,383
Some of the unscrupulous dealers
were running away with peoples' bitcoin

143
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,212
before they'd mailed the drugs out.

144
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:05,050
The community came up with a solution,
called multi-signature escrow payments.

145
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,628
So on purchasing my item,

146
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:13,678
I would send my bitcoin

147
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,994
to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.

148
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,388
The vendor, who would see
that I'd sent it,

149
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:24,368
would be confident that they
could then send the product to me,

150
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:25,775
and then when I received it,

151
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,775
at least two of the three people
engaged in the transaction --

152
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,339
vendor, buyer, site administrator --

153
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,775
would have to sign the transaction off

154
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,877
with a unique digital signature,

155
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,876
and then the money would be transferred.

156
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,563
Brilliant!

157
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,738
Elegant.

158
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:41,913
It works.

159
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:45,528
But then they realized there was
a problem with bitcoin,

160
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,253
because every bitcoin transaction

161
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,775
is actually recorded publicly
in a public ledger.

162
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,076
So if you're clever, you can try
and work out who's behind them.

163
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,385
So they came up with a tumbling service.

164
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,800
Hundreds of people send
their bitcoin into one address,

165
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,799
they're tumbled and jumbled up,

166
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,613
and then the right amount
is sent on to the right recipients,

167
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:07,459
but they're different bitcoins:

168
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:09,173
micro-laundering systems.

169
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:10,731
(Laughter)

170
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:11,911
It's incredible.

171
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,128
Interested in what drugs are trending
right now on the dark net markets?

172
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,229
Check Grams, the search engine.

173
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,418
You can even buy some advertising space.

174
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:23,507
(Laughter)

175
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:28,469
Are you an ethical consumer worried
about what the drugs industry is doing?

176
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,215
Yeah.

177
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,986
One vendor will offer you
fair trade organic cocaine.

178
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,152
(Laughter)

179
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:38,471
That's not being sourced
from Colombian druglords,

180
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,924
but Guatemalan farmers.

181
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:43,260
They even promised to reinvest
20 percent of any profits

182
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:45,074
into local education programs.

183
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,120
(Laughter)

184
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:48,123
There's even a mystery shopper.

185
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:52,320
Now, whatever you think
about the morality of these sites --

186
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,659
and I submit that it's not
actually an easy question --

187
00:09:55,683 --> 00:10:01,185
the creation of functioning,
competitive, anonymous markets,

188
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,775
where nobody knows who anybody else is,

189
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,898
constantly at risk of being shut down
by the authorities,

190
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,456
is a staggering achievement,

191
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,518
a phenomenal achievement.

192
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,993
And it's that kind of innovation

193
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,775
that's why those on the fringes

194
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,646
are often the harbingers
of what is to come.

195
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,464
It's easy to forget

196
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:26,550
that because of its short life,

197
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:30,221
the Internet has actually
changed many times

198
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:31,775
over the last 30 years or so.

199
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,775
It started in the '70s
as a military project,

200
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,775
morphed in the 1980s
to an academic network,

201
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,261
co-opted by commercial
companies in the '90s,

202
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,740
and then invaded by all of us
via social media in the noughties,

203
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:46,693
but I think it's going to change again.

204
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,775
And I think things
like the dark net markets --

205
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,775
creative, secure, difficult to censor --

206
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,401
I think that's the future.

207
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,557
And the reason it's the future

208
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:01,249
is because we're all worried
about our privacy.

209
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:04,498
Surveys consistently show
concerns about privacy.

210
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:08,481
The more time we spend online,
the more we worry about them,

211
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,775
and those surveys show
our worries are growing.

212
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,915
We're worried about
what happens to our data.

213
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,048
We're worried about
who might be watching us.

214
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,640
Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,

215
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:20,110
there's been a huge increase
in the number of people

216
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:23,226
using various privacy-enhancing tools.

217
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,487
There are now between two
and three million daily users

218
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,786
of the Tor browser,

219
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,977
the majority of which use
is perfectly legitimate,

220
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,760
sometimes even mundane.

221
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,809
And there are hundreds of activists
around the world

222
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:44,099
working on techniques and tools
to keep you private online --

223
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,592
default encrypted messaging services.

224
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:51,639
Ethereum, which is a project
which tries to link up

225
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:56,741
the connected but unused hard drives
of millions of computers around the world,

226
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,636
to create a sort of distributed Internet
that no one really controls.

227
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,553
Now, we've had distributed
computing before, of course.

228
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:07,775
We use it for everything from Skype
to the search for extraterrestrial life.

229
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,288
But you add distributed computing
and powerful encryption --

230
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:16,199
that's very, very hard
to censor and control.

231
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,438
Another called MaidSafe
works on similar principles.

232
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,910
Another called Twister,
and so on and so on.

233
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,386
And here's the thing --

234
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,874
the more of us join,

235
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:29,349
the more interesting those sites become,

236
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,861
and then the more of us join, and so on.

237
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,293
And I think that's what's going to happen.

238
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,465
In fact, it's already happening.

239
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,365
The dark net is no longer
a den for dealers

240
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,956
and a hideout for whistle-blowers.

241
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,667
It's already going mainstream.

242
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:52,272
Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin
released his album as a dark net site.

243
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:56,249
Facebook has started a dark net site.

244
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:59,906
A group of London architects
have opened a dark net site

245
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,775
for people worried
about regeneration projects.

246
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,372
Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,

247
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:09,013
and I predict that fairly soon,
every social media company,

248
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,472
every major news outlet,

249
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:13,580
and therefore most of you
in this audience,

250
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:15,960
will be using the dark net, too.

251
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:19,971
So the Internet is about to get
more interesting,

252
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:22,775
more exciting, more innovative,

253
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,524
more terrible,

254
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:25,902
more destructive.

255
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,413
That's good news
if you care about liberty.

256
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,407
It's good news if you care about freedom.

257
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:33,550
It's good news if you care
about democracy.

258
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:34,952
It's also good news

259
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:37,422
if you want to browse
for illegal pornography

260
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,775
and if you want to buy and sell drugs

261
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,092
with impunity.

262
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:45,775
Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.

263
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,476
It's not one side or the other
that's going to win out, but both.

264
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:52,240
Thank you very much, indeed.

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,950
(Applause)
