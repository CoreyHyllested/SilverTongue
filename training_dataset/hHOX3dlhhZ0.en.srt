0
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,656
For over a decade,

1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,736
I have studied young people
that have been pushed out of school,

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
so called "dropouts."

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,776
As they end up failed
by the education system,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,336
they're on the streets
where they're vulnerable to violence,

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,816
police harassment,

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,296
police brutality

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,960
and incarceration.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,776
I follow these young people
for years at a time,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,216
across institutional settings,

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,400
to try to understand what some of us call
the "school-to-prison pipeline."

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,696
When you look at a picture like this,

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,280
of young people who are in my study ...

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,856
you might see trouble.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,056
I mean one of the boys
has a bottle of liquor in his hand,

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,216
he's 14 years old

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,760
and it's a school day.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,936
Other people, when they see this picture,

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,976
might see gangs,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,096
thugs, delinquents --

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
criminals.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,320
But I see it different.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,496
I see these young people
through a perspective

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
that looks at the assets
that they bring to the education system.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,336
So will you join me in changing
the way we label young people

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,000
from "at-risk" to "at-promise?"

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,520
(Applause)

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,616
How do I know that these young people

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,096
have the potential
and the promise to change?

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,160
I know this because I am one of them.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,016
You see, I grew up
in dire poverty in the inner city,

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,256
without a father --

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,360
he abandoned me before I was even born.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,096
We were on welfare,

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,416
sometimes homeless,

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,920
many times hungry.

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,016
By the time I was 15 years old,

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,320
I had been incarcerated in juvy
three times for three felonies.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,480
My best friend had already been killed.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,256
And soon after,

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,816
while I'm standing next to my uncle,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,039
he gets shot.

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,056
And as I'm waiting
for the ambulance to arrive

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
for over an hour ...

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,680
he bleeds to death on the street.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
I had lost faith and hope in the world,

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,496
and I had given up on the system
because the system had failed me.

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,616
I had nothing to offer

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
and no one had anything to offer me.

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,736
I was fatalistic.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I didn't even think
I could make it to my 18th birthday.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,656
The reason I'm here today

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,176
is because a teacher
that cared reached out

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
and managed to tap into my soul.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,376
This teacher,

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Ms. Russ ...

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,216
she was the kind of teacher
that was always in your business.

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,976
(Laughter)

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,456
She was the kind of teacher that was like,

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,616
"Victor, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
(Laughter)

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,536
I wasn't ready.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,200
But she understood one basic principle
about young people like me.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
We're like oysters.

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,496
We're only going to open up
when we're ready,

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,000
and if you're not there when we're ready,

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,294
we're going to clam back up.

67
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,096
Ms. Russ was there for me.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,136
She was culturally relevant,

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,296
she respected my community,
my people, my family.

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,640
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,896
He would take me to work with him
because I was broke,

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,776
and he knew I needed some money.

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,480
He collected glass bottles for a living.

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,376
Four in the morning on a school day,

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,000
we'd throw the glass bottles
in the back of his van,

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
and the bottles would break.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,816
And my hands and arms would start to bleed

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,520
and my tennis shoes and pants
would get all bloody.

79
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,400
And I was terrified and in pain,
and I would stop working.

80
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,176
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes
and he would say to me,

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,536
"Mijo,

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,240
estamos buscando vida."

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,576
"We're searching for a better life,

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
we're trying to make
something out of nothing."

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,696
Ms. Russ listened to my story,

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,216
welcomed it into the classroom and said,

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,280
"Victor, this is your power.

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,240
This is your potential.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,136
Your family, your culture, your community
have taught you a hard-work ethic

90
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,496
and you will use it to empower
yourself in the academic world

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,240
so you can come back
and empower your community."

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,416
With Ms. Russ's help,

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
I ended up returning to school.

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,040
I even finished my credits on time

95
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,720
and graduated with my class.

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,200
(Applause)

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,416
But Ms. Russ said to me
right before graduation,

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,760
"Victor, I'm so proud of you.

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,696
I knew you could do it.

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,936
Now it's time to go to college."

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
(Laughter)

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,536
College, me?

103
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
Man, what is this teacher smoking
thinking I'm going to college?

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,120
I applied with the mentors
and support she provided,

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,016
got a letter of acceptance,

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,256
and one of the paragraphs read,

107
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,640
"You've been admitted
under probationary status."

108
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,896
I said, "Probation?
I'm already on probation,

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,136
that don't matter?"

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,416
(Laughter)

111
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,320
It was academic probation,
not criminal probation.

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,136
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ
do to succeed with young people

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,056
like the ones I study?

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,256
I propose three strategies.

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,496
The first:

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,696
let's get rid of our
deficit perspective in education.

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,976
"These people
come from a culture of violence,

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,256
a culture of poverty.

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,856
These people are at-risk;
these people are truant.

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,760
These people are empty containers
for us to fill with knowledge.

121
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,696
They have the problems,

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
we have the solutions."

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Number two.

124
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,760
Let's value the stories that young people
bring to the schoolhouse.

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,056
Their stories of overcoming
insurmountable odds are so powerful.

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,760
And I know you know some of these stories.

127
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,096
These very same stories and experiences

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,760
already have grit, character
and resilience in them.

129
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,816
So let's help young people
refine those stories.

130
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,816
Let's help them be proud of who they are,

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,776
because our education system
welcomes their families, their cultures,

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,016
their communities

133
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,840
and the skill set
they've learned to survive.

134
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,816
And of course the third strategy
being the most important:

135
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,056
resources.

136
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,920
We have to provide
adequate resources to young people.

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Grit alone isn't going to cut it.

138
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,256
You can sit there
and tell me all you want,

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,416
"Hey man, pick yourself up
by the bootstraps."

140
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,496
But if I was born
without any straps on my boots --

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,736
(Laughter)

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,496
How am I supposed to pick myself up?

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
(Applause)

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,736
Job training,

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,976
mentoring,

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,696
counseling ...

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,456
Teaching young people
to learn from their mistakes

148
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,176
instead of criminalizing them,

149
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,720
and dragging them out
of their classrooms like animals.

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,616
How about this?

151
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,376
I propose that we implement restorative
justice in every high school in America.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,080
(Applause)

153
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,056
So we went out to test these ideas
in the community of Watts in LA

154
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,336
with 40 young people
that had been pushed out of school.

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,040
William was one of them.

156
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,896
William was the kind of kid
that had been given every label.

157
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,136
He had dropped out, he was a gang member,

158
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
a criminal.

159
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,776
And when we met him he was very resistant.

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,216
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,536
"Hey, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

162
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,015
(Laughter)

163
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,320
So over time --

164
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,696
over time he began to open up.

165
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,159
And I remember the day
that he made the switch.

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,616
We were in a large group

167
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,736
and a young lady in our program was crying

168
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,440
because she told us her powerful story

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,696
of her dad being killed

170
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,720
and then his body being shown
in the newspaper the next day.

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,176
And as she's crying,
I don't know what to do,

172
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,936
so I give her her space,

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
and William had enough.

174
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,616
He slammed his hands
on the desk and he said,

175
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,120
"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"

176
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,280
(Applause)

177
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,176
This young lady's tears and pain
turned into joy and laughter

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,776
knowing that her community had her back,

179
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,576
and William had now learned
that he did have a purpose in life:

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,560
to help to heal the souls
of people in his own community.

181
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,176
He told us his story.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,976
We refined his story

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,816
to go from being the story of a victim
to being the story of a survivor

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,216
that has overcome adversity.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,160
We placed high value on it.

186
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,160
William went on to finish high school,

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,096
get his security guard certificate
to become a security guard,

188
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,976
and is now working
at a local school district.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,920
(Applause)

190
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,336
Ms. Russ's mantra --

191
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,616
her mantra was always,

192
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,040
"when you teach to the heart,
the mind will follow."

193
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,520
The great writer Khalil Gibran says,

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,640
"Out of suffering
have emerged the greatest souls.

195
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,360
The massive characters
are seared with scars."

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,696
I believe that in this education
revolution that we're talking about

197
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,656
we need to invite the souls
of the young people that we work with,

198
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,936
and once they're able to refine --

199
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,016
identify their grit,
resilience and character

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
that they've already developed --

201
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,120
their academic performance will improve.

202
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,696
Let's believe in young people.

203
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,016
Let's provide them
the right kinds of resources.

204
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,696
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.

205
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,200
She believed in me so much

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,216
that she tricked me
into believing in myself.

207
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,456
Thank you.

208
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
(Applause)
