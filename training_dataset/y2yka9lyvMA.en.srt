00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,982
Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!

1
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,348
(Applause)

2
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:19,550
Thanks, Pat.

3
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:21,132
Thank you!

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,516
Getting me all wound up, now!

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,546
(Laughter)

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,757
Pat Mitchell: Good!

7
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:32,538
You know, when I was watching
the video again of the match,

8
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:37,051
you must have felt
like the fate of the world's women

9
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,673
was on every stroke you took.

10
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,963
Were you feeling that?

11
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:46,154
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --
he was the former number one player,

12
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:48,180
he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.

13
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:51,086
He was one of my heroes and I admired him.

14
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,336
And that's the reason I beat him,
actually, because I respected him.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,459
(Laughter)

16
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:59,079
It's true -- my mom
and especially my dad always said:

17
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,981
"Respect your opponent,
and never underestimate them, ever."

18
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,293
And he was correct.
He was absolutely correct.

19
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,282
But I knew it was about social change.

20
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,324
And I was really nervous
whenever we announced it,

21
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,217
and I felt like the whole world
was on my shoulders.

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,902
And I thought, "If I lose, it's going
to put women back 50 years, at least."

23
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:24,823
Title IX had just been passed
the year before -- June 23, 1972.

24
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:28,466
And women's professional tennis --

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,763
there were nine of us who signed
a one-dollar contract in 1970 --

26
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,886
now remember, the match is in '73.

27
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:37,614
So we were only in our
third year of having a tour

28
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:41,898
where we could actually play,
have a place to compete and make a living.

29
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,918
So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.

30
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:49,911
And our dream was for any girl,
born any place in the world --

31
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,493
if she was good enough --

32
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:55,628
there would be a place for her to compete
and for us to make a living.

33
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:59,412
Because before 1968,
we made 14 dollars a day,

34
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,888
and we were under the control
of organizations.

35
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,105
So we really wanted
to break away from that.

36
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,845
But we knew it wasn't really
about our generation so much;

37
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,919
we knew it was about
the future generations.

38
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:12,948
We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.

39
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:15,505
But every generation
has the chance to make it better.

40
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,682
That was really on my mind.

41
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:22,325
I really wanted to start matching
the hearts and minds to Title IX.

42
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,136
Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,
which a lot of people probably don't,

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,438
said that any federal funds given
to a high school, college or university,

44
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:32,536
either public or private,

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,462
had to -- finally --
give equal monies to boys and girls.

46
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,400
And that changed everything.

47
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:42,250
(Applause)

48
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,032
So you can have a law,

49
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:46,971
but it's changing the hearts and minds
to match up with it.

50
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,542
That's when it really rocks, totally.

51
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,717
So that was on my mind.

52
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:54,330
I wanted to start that change
in the hearts and minds.

53
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:57,146
But two things came out of that match.

54
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,326
For women: self-confidence, empowerment.

55
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,892
They actually had enough nerve
to ask for a raise.

56
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:07,516
Some women have waited
10, 15 years to ask.

57
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,839
I said, "More importantly,
did you get it?"

58
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:10,931
(Laughter)

59
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,129
And they did!

60
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:13,947
And for the men?

61
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:16,802
A lot of the men today don't realize it,

62
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:22,231
but if you're in your 50s, 60s
or whatever, late 40s,

63
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:25,831
you're the first generation of men
of the Women's Movement --

64
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,147
whether you like it or not!

65
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:30,193
(Laughter)

66
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:31,500
(Applause)

67
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,675
And for the men,

68
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,314
what happened for the men,
they'd come up to me --

69
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:38,439
and most times, the men are the ones
who have tears in their eyes,

70
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:39,614
it's very interesting.

71
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:43,651
They go, "Billie, I was very young
when I saw that match,

72
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,029
and now I have a daughter.

73
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,990
And I am so happy I saw that
as a young man."

74
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:54,137
And one of those young men,
at 12 years old, was President Obama.

75
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,654
And he actually told me that
when I met him, he said:

76
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:00,636
"You don't realize it,
but I saw that match at 12.

77
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,513
And now I have two daughters,

78
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,963
and it has made a difference
in how I raise them."

79
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:09,704
So both men and women got a lot
out of it, but different things.

80
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:13,431
PM: And now there are generations --
at least one or two --

81
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,155
who have experienced the equality

82
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:21,065
that Title IX and other fights
along the way made possible.

83
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,680
And for women, there are generations
who have also experienced teamwork.

84
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:29,754
They got to play team sports
in a way they hadn't before.

85
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:35,227
So you had a legacy already built
in terms of being an athlete,

86
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:40,506
a legacy of the work you did
to lobby for equal pay for women athletes

87
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,804
and the Women's Sports Foundation.

88
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,070
What now are you looking to accomplish

89
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:49,050
with The Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative?

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,208
BJK: I think it goes back
to an epiphany I had at 12.

91
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,233
At 11, I wanted to be the number one
tennis player in the world,

92
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:58,568
and a friend had asked me to play
and I said, "What's that?"

93
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,573
Tennis was not in my family --
basketball was, other sports.

94
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:04,465
Fast forward to 12 years old,

95
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,086
(Laughter)

96
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,324
and I'm finally starting
to play in tournaments

97
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:10,799
where you get a ranking
at the end of the year.

98
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:14,801
So I was daydreaming
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

99
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:19,589
and I started thinking about my sport
and how tiny it was,

100
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,262
but also that everybody who played
wore white shoes, white clothes,

101
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:26,180
played with white balls --
everybody who played was white.

102
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,842
And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
"Where is everyone else?"

103
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:37,373
And that just kept sticking in my brain.

104
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:38,548
And that moment,

105
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,526
I promised myself I'd fight
for equal rights and opportunities

106
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,298
for boys and girls, men and women,
the rest of my life.

107
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,991
And that tennis, if I was fortunate
enough to become number one --

108
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,506
and I knew, being a girl,
it would be harder to have influence,

109
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,507
already at that age --

110
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,577
that I had this platform.

111
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,969
And tennis is global.

112
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:03,192
And I thought, "You know what?

113
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,091
I've been given an opportunity
that very few people have had."

114
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:10,070
I didn't know if I was going
to make it -- this was only 12.

115
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:13,222
I sure wanted it, but making it
is a whole other discussion.

116
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:17,449
I just remember I promised myself,
and I really try to keep my word.

117
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:21,976
That's who I truly am,
just fighting for people.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,210
And, unfortunately, women have had less.

119
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,300
And we are considered less.

120
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:31,592
And so my attentions,
where did they have to go?

121
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:33,801
It was just ... you have to.

122
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:37,056
And learn to stick up for yourself,
hear your own voice.

123
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,417
You hear the same words
keep coming out all the time,

124
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,158
and I got really lucky
because I had an education.

125
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,750
And I think if you can see it
you can be it, you know?

126
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,990
If you can see it, you can be it.

127
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,018
You look at Pat,
you look at other leaders,

128
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,188
you look at these speakers,
look at yourself,

129
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,870
because everyone --

130
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,252
everyone --

131
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,089
can do something extraordinary.

132
00:06:58,113 --> 00:06:59,555
Every single person.

133
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:03,812
PM: And your story, Billie,
has inspired so many women everywhere.

134
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:07,158
Now with the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative,

135
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,366
you're taking on an even bigger cause.

136
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,414
Because one thing we hear a lot
about is women taking their voice,

137
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:16,865
working to find their way
into leadership positions.

138
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,721
But what you're talking
about is even bigger than that.

139
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,974
It's inclusive leadership.

140
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:25,588
And this is a generation that has grown up
thinking more inclusively --

141
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,733
BJK: Isn't it great?
Look at the technology!

142
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:32,309
It's amazing how it connects us all!
It's about connection.

143
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,947
It's simply amazing
what's possible because of it.

144
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,411
But the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative

145
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:41,499
is really about the workforce mostly,
and trying to change it,

146
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:45,868
so people can actually go to work
and be their authentic selves.

147
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,929
Because most of us have two jobs:

148
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,572
One, to fit in -- I'll give you
a perfect example.

149
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,927
An African American woman
gets up an hour earlier to go to work,

150
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,752
straightens her hair in the bathroom,

151
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,959
goes to the bathroom
probably four, five, six times a day

152
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:03,071
to keep straightening her hair,
to keep making sure she fits in.

153
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:04,365
So she's working two jobs.

154
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,774
She's got this other job,
whatever that may be,

155
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:09,008
but she's also trying to fit in.

156
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:13,075
Or this poor man who kept his diploma --

157
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,815
he went to University of Michigan,

158
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,160
but he never would talk about
his poverty as a youngster, ever --

159
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,503
just would not mention it.

160
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,776
So he made sure they saw
he was well-educated.

161
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,782
And then you see a gay guy
who has an NFL --

162
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,447
which means American football
for all of you out there,

163
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,422
it's a big deal, it's very macho --

164
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,469
and he talked about football all the time,

165
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:35,073
because he was gay
and he didn't want anybody to know.

166
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,874
It just goes on and on.

167
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:43,011
So my wish for everyone is to be able
to be their authentic self 24/7,

168
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,841
that would be the ultimate.

169
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:48,391
And we catch ourselves -- I mean,
I catch myself to this day.

170
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:50,562
Even being gay I catch myself,
you know, like,

171
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:51,736
(Gasp)

172
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:55,552
a little uncomfortable,
a little surge in my gut,

173
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,644
feeling not totally
comfortable in my own skin.

174
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,884
So, I think you have to ask yourself --

175
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:06,055
I want people to be themselves,
whatever that is, just let it be.

176
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,791
PM: And the first research
the Leadership Initiative did showed that,

177
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,051
that these examples you just used --

178
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:17,880
that many of us have the problem
of being authentic.

179
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:21,929
But what you've just looked at
is this millennial generation,

180
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:25,491
who have benefited from all these
equal opportunities --

181
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,676
which may not be equal
but exist everywhere --

182
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,419
BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.

183
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,975
Partnership with Teneo,
a strategic company that's amazing.

184
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:36,172
That's really the reason
I'm able to do this.

185
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:37,978
I've had two times in my life

186
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,688
where I've actually had men
really behind me with power.

187
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:44,002
And that was in the old days
with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,

188
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,360
and this is the second time
in my entire life.

189
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:47,733
And then Deloitte.

190
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,942
The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.

191
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:54,192
So Deloitte sent out a survey,

192
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:58,221
and over 4,000 people now have answered,

193
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:00,129
and we're continuing in the workplace.

194
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,300
And what do the millennials feel?

195
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:07,418
Well, they feel a lot, but what
they're so fantastic about is --

196
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,971
you know, our generation was like,
"Oh, we're going to get representation."

197
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,783
So if you walk into a room,
you see everybody represented.

198
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,277
That's not good enough anymore,
which is so good!

199
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:20,521
So the millennials are fantastic;
they want connection, engagement.

200
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,969
They just want you to tell us
what you're feeling, what you're thinking,

201
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:25,246
and get into the solution.

202
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,508
They're problem-solvers,

203
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:29,407
and of course, you've got
the information at your fingertips,

204
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:32,133
compared to when I was growing up.

205
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,685
PM: What did the research show you
about millennials?

206
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,428
Are they going to make a difference?

207
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:40,469
Are they going to create a world where
there is really an inclusive work force?

208
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:46,385
BJK: Well, in 2025,
75 percent of the global workforce

209
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,849
is going to be millennials.

210
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,489
I think they are going
to help solve problems.

211
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,609
I think they have
the wherewithal to do it.

212
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,204
I know they care a lot.

213
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:58,704
They have big ideas
and they can make big things happen.

214
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,367
I want to stay in the now
with the young people,

215
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,285
I don't want to get behind.

216
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,344
(Laughter)

217
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,174
PM: I don't think there's any chance!

218
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,599
But what you found out
in the research about millennials

219
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:17,250
is not really the experience that a lot
of people have with millennials.

220
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:21,038
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --
OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.

221
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:25,945
I've been talking to the Boomers,
who are their bosses, and I go,

222
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,015
"What do you think about the millennials?"

223
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,915
And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,

224
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,395
and they get this face --

225
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,735
(Laughter)

226
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,441
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"

227
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,046
(Laughter)

228
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,558
I say, "Do you really think so?

229
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:41,464
Because I do think they care
about the environment

230
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,783
and all these things."

231
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:47,927
And they go, "Oh, Billie,
they cannot focus."

232
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:50,653
(Laughter)

233
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,296
They actually have proven

234
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,814
that the average focus
for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.

235
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,407
(Laughter)

236
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:58,830
They can't focus.

237
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,263
And they don't really care.

238
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,128
I just heard a story the other night:

239
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,582
a woman owns a gallery
and she has these workers.

240
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,712
She gets a text from one of the workers,

241
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:11,384
like an intern, she's
just starting -- she goes,

242
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,791
"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late
because I'm at the hairdresser's."

243
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:19,727
(Laughter)

244
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:23,563
So she arrives, and this boss says,

245
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:24,738
"What's going on?"

246
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:27,288
And she says, "Oh, I was late,
sorry, how's it going?"

247
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:31,412
She says, "Well, guess what?
I'd like you leave, you're finished."

248
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:32,802
She goes, "OK."

249
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:36,028
(Laughter)

250
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:37,203
No problem!

251
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:38,649
PM: Now Billie, that story --

252
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:41,107
I know, but that's what
scares the boomers --

253
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,994
I'm just telling you --
so I think it's good for us to share.

254
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,587
(Laughter)

255
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,094
No, it is good for us to share,

256
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,187
because we're our authentic selves
and what we're really feeling,

257
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,484
so we've got to take it
both ways, you know?

258
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,455
But I have great faith because --

259
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,372
if you've been in sports like I have --

260
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:59,029
every generation gets better.

261
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,338
It's a fact.

262
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,371
With the Women's Sports Foundation
being the advocates for Title IX still,

263
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,648
because we're trying
to keep protecting the law,

264
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:09,817
because it's in a tenuous position always,

265
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,721
so we really are concerned,

266
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,436
and we do a lot of research.

267
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,134
That's very important to us.

268
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:16,753
And I want to hear from people.

269
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:22,856
But we really have to protect
what Title IX stands for worldwide.

270
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,646
And you heard President Carter
talk about how Title IX is protected.

271
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:32,192
And do you know that every single lawsuit

272
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,734
that girls, at least in sports,
have gone up against --

273
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,167
whatever institutions --

274
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:39,592
has won?

275
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,747
Title IX is there to protect us.

276
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,788
And it is amazing.

277
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:47,788
But we still have to get
the hearts and minds --

278
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:50,549
the hearts and minds
to match the legislation is huge.

279
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,656
PM: So what gets you up every morning?

280
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,112
What keeps you sustaining your work,

281
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,334
sustaining the fight
for equality, extending it,

282
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:01,789
always exploring new areas,
trying to find new ways ... ?

283
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:05,583
BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy
because I was always the curious one.

284
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,422
I'm highly motivated.

285
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:12,225
My younger brother was
a Major League Baseball player.

286
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:15,296
My poor parents did not care
if we were any good.

287
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,562
(Laughter)

288
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,325
And we drove them crazy because we pushed,

289
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,351
we pushed because
we wanted to be the best.

290
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:29,413
And I think it's because of what
I'm hearing today in TED talks.

291
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:33,514
I think to listen to these
different women,

292
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,018
to listen to different people,

293
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,288
to listen to President Carter --
90 years old, by the way,

294
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,784
and he we was throwing these figures
out that I would never --

295
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:42,962
I'd have to go,

296
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:46,277
"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need
to get a list out of these figures."

297
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,978
He was rattling off --
I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.

298
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,329
PM: He's an amazing man.

299
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:54,061
(Applause)

300
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:57,477
BJK: And then you're going to have
President Mary Robinson,

301
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,386
who's a former president --

302
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,292
Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!

303
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,470
(Applause)

304
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:08,911
Congress is voting in June
on same-sex marriage,

305
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:12,871
so these are things that for some people
are very hard to hear.

306
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,676
But always remember,
every one of us is an individual,

307
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,372
a human being with a beating heart,

308
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:21,524
who cares and wants to live
their authentic life.

309
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,374
OK? You don't have to agree with somebody,

310
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:26,111
but everyone has the opportunity.

311
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,999
I think we all have an obligation

312
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:35,887
to continue to keep moving
the needle forward, always.

313
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,909
And these people have been so inspiring.

314
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,863
Everyone matters.

315
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,764
And every one of you is an influencer.

316
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:45,198
You out there listening, out there
in the world, plus the people here --

317
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,037
every single person's an influencer.

318
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,579
Never, ever forget that. OK?

319
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:51,923
So don't ever give up on yourself.

320
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,900
PM: Billie, you have been
an inspiration for us.

321
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:56,074
BJK: Thanks, Pat!

322
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:59,913
(Applause)

323
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:01,088
Thanks, TED!

324
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:03,104
(Applause)

325
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,278
Thanks a lot!
