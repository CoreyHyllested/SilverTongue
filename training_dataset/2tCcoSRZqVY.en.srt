0
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,571
It would be nice to be
objective in life,

1
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,593
in many ways.

2
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,971
The problem is that we have
these color-tinted glasses

3
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:25,650
as we look at all kinds of situations.

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,366
For example, think about
something as simple as beer.

5
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,548
If I gave you a few beers to taste

6
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:35,356
and I asked you to rate them
on intensity and bitterness,

7
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:39,053
different beers would occupy
different space.

8
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,810
But what if we tried
to be objective about it?

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,970
In the case of beer,
it would be very simple.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,122
What if we did a blind taste?

11
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,846
Well, if we did the same thing,
you tasted the same beer,

12
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:52,817
now in the blind taste,
things would look slightly different.

13
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:55,039
Most of the beers will go into one place.

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,484
You will basically not
be able to distinguish them,

15
00:00:57,484 --> 00:01:00,573
and the exception, of course,
will be Guinness.

16
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,801
(Laughter)

17
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,587
Similarly, we can think about physiology.

18
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,629
What happens when people expect
something from their physiology?

19
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:11,137
For example, we sold people
pain medications.

20
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,876
Some people, we told them
the medications were expensive.

21
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,757
Some people, we told them it was cheap.

22
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,729
And the expensive
pain medication worked better.

23
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,283
It relieved more pain from people,

24
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:24,787
because expectations
do change our physiology.

25
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:26,849
And of course, we all know that in sports,

26
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,667
if you are a fan of a particular team,

27
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,036
you can't help but see the game

28
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:34,541
develop from the perspective of your team.

29
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,717
So all of those are cases in which
our preconceived notions

30
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:42,157
and our expectations color our world.

31
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:45,559
But what happened
in more important questions?

32
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:49,111
What happened with questions
that had to do with social justice?

33
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,516
So we wanted to think about
what is the blind tasting version

34
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:55,581
for thinking about inequality?

35
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,880
So we started looking at inequality,

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,830
and we did some large-scale surveys

37
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,384
around the U.S. and other countries.

38
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:04,335
So we asked two questions:

39
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,701
Do people know what kind of
level of inequality we have?

40
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:11,812
And then, what level of inequality
do we want to have?

41
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,226
So let's think about the first question.

42
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,339
Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.

43
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:19,264
and I sorted them from
the poorest on the right

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,656
to the richest on the left,

45
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:24,318
and then I divided them into five buckets:

46
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,616
the poorest 20 percent,
the next 20 percent,

47
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:29,472
the next, the next,
and the richest 20 percent.

48
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,468
And then I asked you to tell me
how much wealth do you think

49
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:35,417
is concentrated in each of those buckets.

50
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,878
So to make it simpler,
imagine I ask you to tell me,

51
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,138
how much wealth do you think
is concentrated

52
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:42,398
in the bottom two buckets,

53
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:44,659
the bottom 40 percent?

54
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:47,351
Take a second. Think about it
and have a number.

55
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,255
Usually we don't think.

56
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,740
Think for a second,
have a real number in your mind.

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,365
You have it?

58
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,430
Okay, here's what lots
of Americans tell us.

59
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,357
They think that the bottom 20 percent

60
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,679
has about 2,9 percent of the wealth,

61
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,862
the next group has 6,4,

62
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:05,369
so together it's slightly more than nine.

63
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:08,782
The next group, they say, has 12 percent,

64
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,431
20 percent,

65
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:15,075
and the richest 20 percent, people think
has 58 percent of the wealth.

66
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:18,210
You can see how this relates
to what you thought.

67
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,951
Now, what's reality?

68
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,762
Reality is slightly different.

69
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:25,575
The bottom 20 percent
has 0,1 percent of the wealth.

70
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,826
The next 20 percent
has 0,2 percent of the wealth.

71
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,939
Together, it's 0,3.

72
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,468
The next group has 3,9,

73
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:36,651
11,3,

74
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:42,392
and the richest group
has 84-85 percent of the wealth.

75
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:45,358
So what we actually have
and what we think we have

76
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,331
are very different.

77
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:49,421
What about what we want?

78
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,418
How do we even figure this out?

79
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:52,829
So to look at this,

80
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,407
to look at what we really want,

81
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,472
we thought about
the philosopher John Rawls.

82
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:59,307
If you remember John Rawls,

83
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:02,557
he had this notion
of what's a just society.

84
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,039
He said a just society

85
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,754
is a society that if
you knew everything about it,

86
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:09,187
you would be willing
to enter it in a random place.

87
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:10,711
And it's a beautiful definition,

88
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:13,189
because if you're wealthy,
you might want the wealthy

89
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,226
to have more money, the poor to have less.

90
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,335
If you're poor, you might
want more equality.

91
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:19,339
But if you're going
to go into that society

92
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,659
in every possible situation,
and you don't know,

93
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,865
you have to consider all the aspects.

94
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,791
It's a little bit like blind tasting
in which you don't know

95
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,461
what the outcome will be
when you make a decision,

96
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:34,176
and Rawls called this
the "veil of ignorance."

97
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:37,783
So, we took another group,
a large group of Americans,

98
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:40,538
and we asked them the question
in the veil of ignorance.

99
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:44,648
What are the characteristics of a country
that would make you want to join it,

100
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:47,806
knowing that you could end
randomly at any place?

101
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:49,285
And here is what we got.

102
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,544
What did people want to give
to the first group,

103
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:53,727
the bottom 20 percent?

104
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,421
They wanted to give them
about 10 percent of the wealth.

105
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,021
The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,

106
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:04,384
21, 22 and 32.

107
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,890
Now, nobody in our sample
wanted full equality.

108
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,323
Nobody thought that socialism
is a fantastic idea in our sample.

109
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,611
But what does it mean?

110
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,649
It means that we have this knowledge gap

111
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,307
between what we have
and what we think we have,

112
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,022
but we have at least as big a gap
between what we think is right

113
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,820
to what we think we have.

114
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,012
Now, we can ask these questions,
by the way, not just about wealth.

115
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,427
We can ask it about other things as well.

116
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:34,630
So for example, we asked people
from different parts of the world

117
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,348
about this question,

118
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,691
people who are liberals and conservatives,

119
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,735
and they gave us basically
the same answer.

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,217
We asked rich and poor,
they gave us the same answer,

121
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,518
men and women,

122
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,211
NPR listeners and Forbes readers.

123
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:50,440
We asked people in England,
Australia, the U.S. --

124
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,157
very similar answers.

125
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,928
We even asked different
departments of a university.

126
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,686
We went to Harvard and we checked
almost every department,

127
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,698
and in fact, from Harvard Business School,

128
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:03,410
where a few people wanted the wealthy
to have more and the [poor] to have less,

129
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,950
the similarity was astonishing.

130
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,774
I know some of you went
to Harvard Business School.

131
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:12,120
We also asked this question
about something else.

132
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,089
We asked, what about the ratio
of CEO pay to unskilled workers?

133
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,246
So you can see what
people think is the ratio,

134
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,147
and then we can ask the question,
what do they think should be the ratio?

135
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,774
And then we can ask, what is reality?

136
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:30,052
What is reality? And you could say,
well, it's not that bad, right?

137
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:32,205
The red and the yellow
are not that different.

138
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:36,125
But the fact is, it's because
I didn't draw them on the same scale.

139
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:42,015
It's hard to see, there's yellow
and blue in there.

140
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,360
So what about other outcomes of wealth?

141
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,055
Wealth is not just about wealth.

142
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,679
We asked, what about things like health?

143
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:52,812
What about availability
of prescription medication?

144
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,832
What about life expectancy?

145
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,247
What about life expectancy of infants?

146
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:59,592
How do we want this to be distributed?

147
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:02,401
What about education for young people?

148
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,271
And for older people?

149
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:07,254
And across all of those things,
what we learned was that people

150
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:10,412
don't like inequality of wealth,

151
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:13,918
but there's other things where inequality,
which is an outcome of wealth,

152
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,961
is even more aversive to them:

153
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:19,932
for example, inequality
in health or education.

154
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:22,393
We also learned that people
are particularly open

155
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:24,947
to changes in equality
when it comes to people

156
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,991
who have less agency --

157
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,336
basically, young kids and babies,

158
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:34,003
because we don't think of them
as responsible for their situation.

159
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,348
So what are some lessons from this?

160
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,508
We have two gaps:

161
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:40,088
We have a knowledge gap
and we have a desirability gap

162
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,710
And the knowledge gap
is something that we think about,

163
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,080
how do we educate people?

164
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,796
How do we get people to think
differently about inequality

165
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:50,558
and the consequences of inequality
in terms of health, education,

166
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,949
jealousy, crime rate, and so on?

167
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,830
Then we have the desirability gap.

168
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,653
How do we get people to think differently
about what we really want?

169
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:02,028
You see, the Rawls definition,
the Rawls way of looking at the world,

170
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,770
the blind tasting approach,

171
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,695
takes our selfish motivation
out of the picture.

172
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,272
How do we implement that
to a higher degree

173
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,896
on a more extensive scale?

174
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,752
And finally, we also have an action gap.

175
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,701
How do we take these things
and actually do something about it?

176
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:20,603
I think part of the answer
is to think about people

177
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:23,715
like young kids and babies
that don't have much agency,

178
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:27,523
because people seem to be
more willing to do this.

179
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:32,793
To summarize, I would say,
next time you go to drink beer or wine,

180
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:36,880
first of all, think about, what is it
in your experience that is real,

181
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,154
and what is it in your experience
that is a placebo effect

182
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,758
coming from expectations?

183
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:45,287
And then think about what it also means
for other decisions in your life,

184
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,362
and hopefully also for policy questions

185
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,667
that affect all of us.

186
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,394
Thanks a lot.

187
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,731
(Applause)
