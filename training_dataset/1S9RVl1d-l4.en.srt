0
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,735
"We're declaring war against cancer,

1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,360
and we will win this war by 2015."

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,176
This is what the US Congress
and the National Cancer Institute declared

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,760
just a few years ago, in 2003.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,656
Now, I don't know about you,
but I don't buy that.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,736
I don't think we quite won this war yet,

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,400
and I don't think
anyone here will question that.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,296
Now, I will argue that a primary reason

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,456
why we're not winning
this war against cancer

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,776
is because we're fighting blindly.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,375
I'm going to start by sharing with you
a story about a good friend of mine.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,616
His name is Ehud,

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,776
and a few years ago,
Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,656
And not just any type of brain cancer:

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,856
he was diagnosed with one
of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,096
In fact, it was so deadly

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,776
that the doctors told him
that they only have 12 months,

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,216
and during those 12 months,
they have to find a treatment.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,696
They have to find a cure,

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,880
and if they cannot
find a cure, he will die.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,256
Now, the good news, they said,

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,216
is that there are tons
of different treatments to choose from,

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,456
but the bad news is

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,016
that in order for them to tell
if a treatment is even working or not,

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,536
well, that takes them
about three months or so.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,936
So they cannot try that many things.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,056
Well, Ehud is now going
into his first treatment,

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,336
and during that first treatment,
just a few days into that treatment,

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,696
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,
"Adam, I think this is working.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,536
I think we really lucked out here.
Something is happening."

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,016
And I ask him, "Really?
How do you know that, Ehud?"

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,256
And he says, "Well,
I feel so terrible inside.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,136
Something's gotta be working up there.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,376
It just has to."

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,840
Well, unfortunately, three months later,
we got the news, it didn't work.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,576
And so Ehud goes
into his second treatment.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,856
And again, the same story.

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,616
"It feels so bad, something's
gotta be working there."

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,576
And then three months later,
again we get bad news.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,536
Ehud is going into his third treatment,
and then his fourth treatment.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,080
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,376
Now, when someone really close to you
is going through such a huge struggle,

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,216
you get really swamped with emotions.

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,336
A lot of things
are going through your head.

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,816
For me, it was mostly outrage.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,536
I was just outraged that, how come
this is the best that we can offer?

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,856
And I started looking
more and more into this.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,336
As it turns out, this is not just
the best that doctors could offer Ehud.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,176
It's not just the best doctors could offer
patients with brain cancer generally.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,400
We're actually not doing that well
all across the board with cancer.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,096
I picked up one of those statistics,

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,896
and I'm sure some of you
have seen those statistics before.

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,376
This is going to show you here
how many patients actually died of cancer,

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,416
in this case females in the United States,

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,736
ever since the 1930s.

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,936
You'll notice that there aren't
that many things that have changed.

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,256
It's still a huge issue.

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,016
You'll see a few changes, though.

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,576
You'll see lung cancer,
for example, on the rise.

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Thank you, cigarettes.

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,856
And you'll also see that,
for example, stomach cancer

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,216
once used to be one
of the biggest killers of all cancers,

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,680
is essentially eliminated.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,536
Now, why is that?
Anyone knows, by the way?

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,896
Why is it that humanity is no longer
struck by stomach cancer?

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,776
What was the huge, huge
medical technology breakthrough

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,160
that came to our world
that saved humanity from stomach cancer?

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,056
Was it maybe a new drug,
or a better diagnostic?

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,376
You guys are right, yeah.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,016
It's the invention of the refrigerator,

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,656
and the fact that we're
no longer eating spoiled meats.

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,976
So the best thing
that happened to us so far

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,936
in the medical arena in cancer research

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,151
is the fact that
the refrigerator was invented.

74
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,376
(Laughter)

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,656
And so -- yeah, I know.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,096
We're not doing so well here.

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,456
I don't want to miniaturize the progress

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,856
and everything that's been done
in cancer research.

79
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,296
Look, there is like 50-plus years
of good cancer research

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,736
that discovered major, major things
that taught us about cancer.

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,496
But all that said,

82
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,092
we have a lot of heavy lifting
to still do ahead of us.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,016
Again, I will argue that the primary
reason why this is the case,

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
why we have not done that remarkably well,

85
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:01,896
is really we're fighting blindly here.

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,136
And this is where
medical imaging comes in.

87
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
This is where my own work comes in.

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,136
And so to give you a sense
of the best medical imaging

89
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,656
that's offered today
to brain cancer patients,

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,856
or actually generally
to all cancer patients,

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,816
take a look at this PET scan right here.

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,080
Let's see. There we go.

93
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,336
So this is a PET/CT scan,

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,816
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,056
is the CT scan will show you
where the bones are,

96
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
and the PET scan will show you
where tumors are.

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,176
Now, what you can see here

98
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,616
is essentially a sugar molecule

99
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,456
that was added a small little tag

100
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,576
that is signaling to us
outside of the body,

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,896
"Hey, I'm here."

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,736
And those sugar molecules are injected
into these patients by the billions,

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,456
and they're going all over the body

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,560
looking for cells
that are hungry for sugar.

105
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,976
You'll see that the heart,
for example, lights up there.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,216
That's because the heart
needs a lot of sugar.

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,576
You'll also see that the bladder
lights up there.

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,216
That's because the bladder
is the thing that's clearing

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,640
the sugar away from our body.

110
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,096
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,736
and these are in fact the tumors.

112
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,896
Now, this is a really
a wonderful technology.

113
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,056
For the first time it allowed us
to look into someone's body

114
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,456
without picking up
each and every one of the cells

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,336
and putting them under the microscope,

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,376
but in a noninvasive way
allowing us to look into someone's body

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,536
and ask, "Hey,
has the cancer metastasized?

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,776
Where is it?"

119
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,296
And the PET scans here
are showing you very clearly

120
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,600
where are these hot spots,
where is the tumor.

121
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,776
So as miraculous as this might seem,

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.

123
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
You see, those
small little hot spots there.

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,760
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells
are in any one of these tumors?

125
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,936
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,

126
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,656
and let me make sure
that this number sunk in.

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,016
In each and every one
of these small little blips

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,616
that you're seeing on the image,

129
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,736
there needs to be
at least 100 million cancer cells

130
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,296
in order for it to be detected.

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,776
Now, if that seemed to you
like a very large number,

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
it is a very large number.

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,696
This is in fact
an incredibly large number,

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,056
because what we really need
in order to pick up something early enough

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,016
to do something about it,
to do something meaningful about it,

136
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,176
well, we need to pick up tumors
that are a thousand cells in size,

137
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,336
and ideally just
a handful of cells in size.

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,376
So we're clearly
pretty far away from this.

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,656
So we're going to play
a little experiment here.

140
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,136
I'm going to ask each of you
to now play and imagine

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,520
that you are brain surgeons.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,016
And you guys are now at an operating room,

143
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,056
and there's a patient in front of you,

144
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,800
and your task is to make sure
that the tumor is out.

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,776
So you're looking down at the patient,

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,136
the skin and the skull
have already been removed,

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,696
so you're looking at the brain.

148
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,416
And all you know about this patient

149
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,256
is that there's a tumor
about the size of a golf ball or so

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
in the right frontal lobe
of this person's brain.

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,416
And that's more or less it.

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,656
So you're looking down, and unfortunately
everything looks the same,

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,776
because brain cancer tissue
and healthy brain tissue

154
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,376
really just look the same.

155
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,296
And so you're going in with your thumb,

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,656
and you start to press
a little bit on the brain,

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,096
because tumors tend to be
a little harder, stiffer,

158
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,736
and so you go in and go
a little bit like this and say,

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,736
"It seems like the tumor is right there."

160
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,416
Then you take out your knife
and start cutting the tumor

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,696
piece by piece by piece.

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,416
And as you're taking the tumor out,

163
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,656
then you're getting
to a stage where you think,

164
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,816
"Alright, I'm done.
I took out everything."

165
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,376
And at this stage, if that's --

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,096
so far everything sounded,
like, pretty crazy --

167
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,816
you're now about to face the most
challenging decision of your life here.

168
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,376
Because now you need to decide,

169
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,096
should I stop here
and let this patient go,

170
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,056
risking that there might be
some leftover cancer cells behind

171
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,936
that I just couldn't see,

172
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,616
or should I take away some extra margins,

173
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,496
typically about an inch or so
around the tumor

174
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,720
just to be sure that I removed everything?

175
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,240
So this is not a simple decision to make,

176
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,776
and unfortunately this is the decision

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,136
that brain cancer surgeons
have to take every single day

178
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
as they're seeing their patients.

179
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,256
And so I remember talking
to a few friends of mine in the lab,

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,656
and we say, "Boy,
there's got to be a better way."

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,096
But not just like you tell a friend
that there's got to be a better way.

182
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,073
There's just got to be a better way here.

183
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,616
This is just incredible.

184
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,296
And so we looked back.

185
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,296
Remember those PET scans I told you about,
the sugar and so on.

186
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,056
We said, hey, how about
instead of using sugar molecules,

187
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,216
let's maybe take tiny, tiny
little particles made of gold,

188
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,896
and let's program them with some
interesting chemistry around them.

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,336
Let's program them
to look for cancer cells.

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,456
And then we will inject
these gold particles

191
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,736
into these patients by the billions again,

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,736
and we'll have them go all over the body,

193
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,736
and just like secret agents, if you will,

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,576
go and walk by
every single cell in our body

195
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,296
and knock on the door of that cell,

196
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,056
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell
or are you a healthy cell?

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,096
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,856
If you're a cancer cell,
we're sticking in and shining out

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,976
and telling us,
"Hey, look at me, I'm here."

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,376
And they'll do it
through some interesting cameras

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,816
that we developed in the lab.

202
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,775
And once we see that,
maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons

203
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,200
towards taking only the tumor
and leaving the healthy brain alone.

204
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,776
And so we've tested that,
and boy, this works well.

205
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,776
So I'm going to show you an example now.

206
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,576
What you're looking at here

207
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,536
is an image of a mouse's brain,

208
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,696
and we've implanted
into this mouse's brain

209
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,976
a small little tumor.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,616
And so this tumor is now
growing in this mouse's brain,

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,296
and then we've taken a doctor
and asked the doctor

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,136
to please operate on the mouse
as if that was a patient,

213
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,576
and take out piece by piece
out of the tumor.

214
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,376
And while he's doing that,

215
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,376
we're going to take images
to see where the gold particles are.

216
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,016
And so we're going to first start

217
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,456
by injecting these gold particles
into this mouse,

218
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,376
and we're going to see
right here at the very left there

219
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,656
that image at the bottom

220
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,176
is the image that shows
where the gold particles are.

221
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,256
The nice thing
is that these gold particles

222
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,296
actually made it all the way to the tumor,

223
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,976
and then they shine out and tell us,
"Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,376
So now we can see the tumor,

225
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,536
but we're not showing this
to the doctor yet.

226
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,616
We're asking the doctor,
now please start cutting away the tumor,

227
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,056
and you'll see here the doctor
just took the first quadrant of the tumor

228
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,296
and you see that first quadrant
is now missing.

229
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,776
The doctor then took
the second quadrant, the third,

230
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,536
and now it appears to be everything.

231
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,296
And so at this stage,
the doctor came back to us and said,

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,576
"Alright, I'm done.
What do you want me to do?

233
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,176
Should I keep things as they are

234
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,696
or do you want me to take
some extra margins around?"

235
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,376
And then we said, "Well, hang on."

236
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,816
We told the doctor,
"You've missed those two spots,

237
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
so rather than taking huge margins around,

238
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,696
only take out those tiny little areas.

239
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,736
Take them out,
and then let's take a look."

240
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,616
And so the doctor took them away,
and lo and behold,

241
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,656
the cancer is now completely gone.

242
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,056
Now, the important thing

243
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,700
is that it's not just
that the cancer is completely gone

244
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,056
from this person's brain,

245
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,400
or from this mouse's brain.

246
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,416
The most important thing

247
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,336
is that we did not have to take
huge amounts of healthy brain

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,576
in the process.

249
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,776
And so now we can actually imagine a world

250
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,696
where doctors and surgeons,
as they take away a tumor,

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,140
they actually know what to take out,

252
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,280
and they no longer
have to guess with their thumb.

253
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,456
Now, here's why it's extremely important
to take those tiny little leftover tumors.

254
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,336
Those leftover tumors,
even if it's just a handful of cells,

255
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,416
they will grow to recur the tumor,

256
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,096
for the tumor to come back.

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,056
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent

258
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,296
of those brain cancer surgeries
ultimately fail

259
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,096
is because of those small little
extra margins that were left positive,

260
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,800
those small little leftover tumors
that were left there.

261
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,616
So this is clearly very nice,

262
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,936
but what I really want to share with you
is where I think we're heading from here.

263
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,616
And so in my lab at Stanford,

264
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,160
my students and I are asking,
what should we be working on now?

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,456
And I think where
medical imaging is heading to

266
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,816
is the ability to look into the human body

267
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,280
and actually see each and every one
of these cells separately.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,736
The ability like this would allow us

269
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,656
to actually pick up tumors
way, way earlier in the process,

270
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
way before it's 100 million cells inside,
so we can actually do something about it.

271
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,616
An ability to see each and every one
of the cells might also allow us

272
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,016
to ask insightful questions.

273
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,136
So in the lab,
we are now getting to a point

274
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,416
where we can actually start asking
these cancer cells real questions,

275
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,216
like, for example, are you responding
to the treatment we are giving you or not?

276
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,696
So if you're not responding, we'll know
to stop the treatment right away,

277
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,760
days into the treatment, not three months.

278
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,656
And so also for patients like Ehud

279
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,096
that are going through these
nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,376
for them not to suffer

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,296
through those horrendous
side effects of the drugs

282
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,976
when the drugs are
in fact not even helping them.

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,936
So to be frank here,

284
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,416
we're pretty far away
from winning the war against cancer,

285
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,696
just to be realistic.

286
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,616
But at least I am hopeful

287
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,776
that we should be able to fight this war
with better medical imaging techniques

288
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,656
in the way that is not blind.

289
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,896
Thank you.

290
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,160
(Applause)
