0
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:15,022
In the spring of 2016,

1
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:19,450
a legal battle between Apple
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

2
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:21,152
captured the world's attention.

3
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,972
Apple has built security features
into its mobile products

4
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:28,829
which protect data on its devices
from everyone but the owner.

5
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:33,498
That means that criminals, hackers
and yes, even governments

6
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:34,842
are all locked out.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,779
For Apple's customers,
this is a great thing.

8
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,620
But governments are not so happy.

9
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:43,469
You see, Apple has made
a conscious decision

10
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,053
to get out of the surveillance business.

11
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:49,288
Apple has tried to make surveillance
as difficult as possible

12
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,678
for governments and any other actors.

13
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:56,006
There are really two
smartphone operating systems

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,658
in the global smartphone market:

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,396
iOS and Android.

16
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,817
iOS is made by Apple.
Android is made by Google.

17
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:06,570
Apple has spent a lot of time and money

18
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,865
to make sure that its products
are as secure as possible.

19
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,892
Apple encrypts all data
stored on iPhones by default,

20
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,922
and text messages sent from one
Apple customer to another Apple customer

21
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,648
are encrypted by default

22
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:22,189
without the user having
to take any actions.

23
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,380
What this means is that,

24
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:28,184
if the police seize an iPhone
and it has a password,

25
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:32,366
they'll have a difficult time
getting any data off of it,

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,802
if they can do it at all.

27
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:38,512
In contrast, the security of Android
just really isn't as good.

28
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:41,582
Android phones, or at least
most of the Android phones

29
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,212
that have been sold to consumers,

30
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,091
do not encrypt data stored
on the device by default,

31
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:51,101
and the built-in text messaging app
in Android does not use encryption.

32
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:54,249
So if the police seize an Android phone,

33
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:57,630
chances are, they'll be able to get
all the data they want

34
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:58,946
off of that device.

35
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,544
Two smartphones

36
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,901
from two of the biggest
companies in the world;

37
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,282
one that protects data by default,

38
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:08,222
and one that doesn't.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,982
Apple is a seller of luxury goods.

40
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,255
It dominates the high end of the market.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,064
And we would expect a manufacturer
of luxury goods to have products

42
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,045
that include more features.

43
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,974
But not everyone can afford an iPhone.

44
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:26,585
That's where Android
really, really dominates:

45
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,360
at the middle and low end of the market,

46
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:32,010
smartphones for the billion
and a half people

47
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:34,904
who cannot or will not spend

48
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:37,389
600 dollars on a phone.

49
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:47,105
But the dominance of Android
has led to what I call

50
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,341
the "digital security divide."

51
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,350
That is, there is now increasingly a gap

52
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:56,499
between the privacy
and security of the rich,

53
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,293
who can afford devices
that secure their data by default,

54
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,288
and of the poor,

55
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:06,525
whose devices do very little
to protect them by default.

56
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,782
So, think of the average Apple customer:

57
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:16,875
a banker, a lawyer,
a doctor, a politician.

58
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:22,641
These individuals now increasingly have
smartphones in their pockets

59
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:26,138
that encrypt their calls,
their text messages,

60
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:27,697
all the data on the device,

61
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:31,729
without them doing really anything
to secure their information.

62
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,949
In contrast, the poor
and the most vulnerable in our societies

63
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:42,160
are using devices that leave them
completely vulnerable to surveillance.

64
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:45,054
In the United States, where I live,

65
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:49,027
African-Americans are more likely
to be seen as suspicious

66
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,902
or more likely to be profiled,

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,305
and are more likely to be targeted
by the state with surveillance.

68
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,797
But African-Americans
are also disproportionately likely

69
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,917
to use Android devices
that do nothing at all

70
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,011
to protect them from that surveillance.

71
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:06,298
This is a problem.

72
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:10,045
We must remember
that surveillance is a tool.

73
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,458
It's a tool used by those in power

74
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,192
against those who have no power.

75
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,923
And while I think it's absolutely great

76
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:25,395
that companies like Apple
are making it easy for people to encrypt,

77
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:30,170
if the only people
who can protect themselves

78
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:31,685
from the gaze of the government

79
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,269
are the rich and powerful,

80
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,928
that's a problem.

81
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:39,111
And it's not just a privacy
or a cybersecurity problem.

82
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,283
It's a civil rights problem.

83
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:45,673
So the lack of default security in Android

84
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:51,076
is not just a problem
for the poor and vulnerable users

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,318
who are depending on these devices.

86
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,602
This is actually a problem
for our democracy.

87
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,705
I'll explain what I mean.

88
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,389
Modern social movements
rely on technology --

89
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:06,836
from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring
to Occupy Wall Street.

90
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:11,213
The organizers of these movements
and the members of these movements

91
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:15,177
increasingly communicate
and coordinate with smartphones.

92
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:20,297
And so, naturally governments
that feel threatened by these movements

93
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,977
will also target the organizers
and their smartphones.

94
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,536
Now, it's quite possible

95
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,624
that a future Martin Luther King
or a Mandela or a Gandhi

96
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:35,505
will have an iPhone and be protected
from government surveillance.

97
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,830
But chances are,

98
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,568
they'll probably have a cheap,
$20 Android phone in their pocket.

99
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,497
And so if we do nothing
to address the digital security divide,

100
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,389
if we do nothing to ensure
that everyone in our society

101
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,452
gets the same benefits of encryption

102
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:57,133
and is equally able to protect themselves
from surveillance by the state,

103
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:01,939
not only will the poor and vulnerable
be exposed to surveillance,

104
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,345
but future civil rights
movements may be crushed

105
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,789
before they ever reach
their full potential.

106
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:08,980
Thank you.

107
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:12,111
(Applause)

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,866
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.

109
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,762
I have a question for you.

110
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:21,639
We saw recently in the press

111
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:27,167
that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook
covers over his camera

112
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:30,165
and does something
with his headphone mic jack.

113
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,734
So I wanted to ask you
a personal question, which is:

114
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,910
Do you do that?

115
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,513
And, on behalf of everyone
here, particularly myself,

116
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:37,862
Should we be doing that?

117
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,654
Should we be covering these things?

118
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:43,839
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --
actually, I like Band-Aids,

119
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,128
because you can remove them
and put them back on

120
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,464
whenever you want to make
a call or a Skype call.

121
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,190
Putting a sticker over your web cam

122
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,890
is probably the best thing
you can do for your privacy

123
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,420
in terms of bang for buck.

124
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:58,341
There really is malware,
malicious software out there

125
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,222
that can take over your web cam,

126
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,116
even without the light turning on.

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,309
This is used by criminals.
This is used by stalkers.

128
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:10,271
You can buy $19,99 "spy
on your ex-girlfriend" software online.

129
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,446
It's really terrifying.

130
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,994
And then, of course,
it's used by governments.

131
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:17,239
And there's obviously
a sexual violence component to this,

132
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:20,964
which is that this kind of surveillance
can be used most effectively

133
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:27,791
against women and other people
who can be shamed in our society.

134
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,525
Even if you think
you have nothing to hide,

135
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:35,107
at the very least, if you have
children, teenagers in your lives,

136
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:38,141
make sure you put a sticker
on their camera and protect them.

137
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,159
HW: Wow. Thank you so much.
CS: Thank you.

138
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,334
HW: Thanks, Chris.

139
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,830
(Applause)
