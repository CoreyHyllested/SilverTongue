0
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,261
When I was only three or four,

1
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:17,753
I fell in love with poetry,

2
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:20,888
with the rhythms
and the music of language;

3
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:24,555
with the power of metaphor and of imagery,

4
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,341
poetry being the essence
of communication --

5
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:30,072
the discipline, the distillation.

6
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,961
And all these years later,
the poems I'll read today

7
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:37,286
are from my just-finished
seventh book of poetry.

8
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,326
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease.

9
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:44,794
Though there's no cure yet,

10
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:47,604
advances in treatment
are really impressive.

11
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,975
But you can imagine
that I was appalled to learn

12
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:55,493
that women are largely
left out of research trials,

13
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:59,038
despite gender-specific
medical findings having demonstrated

14
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,721
that we are not actually just small men --

15
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,842
(Laughter)

16
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:07,118
who happen to have
different reproductive systems.

17
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:09,971
Gender-specific medicine
is good for men, too.

18
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:15,078
But you bring to a crisis
the person you already are,

19
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:18,975
including the, yes, momentum
that you've learned to invoke

20
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:22,308
through passionate caring
and through action,

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,700
both of which require
but also create energy.

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,756
So as an activist, I began working
with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,961
that's pdf.org --

24
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:40,724
to create a major initiative to put women
on the Parkinson's disease map.

25
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,044
And as a poet, I began working
with this subject matter,

26
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:49,792
finding it tragic, hilarious,
sometimes even joyful.

27
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:52,723
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;

28
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:55,372
I feel distilled by it,

29
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:59,834
and I actually very much
like the woman I'm distilling into.

30
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,429
"No Signs of Struggle"

31
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,619
Growing small requires enormity of will:

32
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,231
just sitting still
in the doctor's waiting room

33
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:14,841
watching the future shuffle in and out,

34
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:17,608
watching it stoop; stare at you

35
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:19,594
while you try not to look.

36
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,856
Rare is an exchange:

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,023
a smile of brief, wry recognition.

38
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,716
You are the new kid on the block.

39
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,352
Everyone here was you once.

40
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,998
You are still learning that growing small
requires a largeness of spirit

41
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,481
you can't fit into yet:

42
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:41,454
acceptance of irritating help
from those who love you;

43
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,562
giving way and over, but not up.

44
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:48,722
You've swallowed hard the contents
of the "Drink Me" bottle,

45
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,931
and felt yourself shrink.

46
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,319
Now, familiar furniture looms,

47
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:59,129
floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only
when wrestled round with both hands.

48
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:04,555
It demands colossal patience,
all this growing small:

49
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,475
your diminished sleep at night,

50
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:09,928
your handwriting, your voice, your height.

51
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,893
You are more the incredible
shrinking woman

52
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:17,840
than the Buddhist mystic,
serene, making do with less.

53
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,645
Less is not always more.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,140
Yet in this emptying space,
space glimmers,

55
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,798
becoming visible.

56
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:31,474
Here is a place behind the eyes
of those accustomed

57
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,767
by what some would call diminishment.

58
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:39,143
It is a place of merciless poetry,

59
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,486
a gift of presence previously ignored,

60
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,579
drowned in the daily clutter.

61
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:48,438
Here every gesture needs intention,

62
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,468
is alive with consciousness.

63
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,346
Nothing is automatic.

64
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,661
You can spot it
in the provocation of a button,

65
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,898
an arm poking at a sleeve,

66
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:03,271
a balancing act at a night-time curb
while negotiating the dark.

67
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:07,167
Feats of such modest valor,

68
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:12,495
who would suspect them to be exercises
in an intimate, fierce discipline,

69
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,820
a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?

70
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,452
Such understated power here,

71
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:23,764
in these tottering dancers
who exert stupendous effort

72
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,874
on tasks most view as insignificant.

73
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,913
Such quiet beauty here, in these,

74
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,210
my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;

75
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,932
such resolve masked by each placid face.

76
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:44,530
There is immensity required
in growing small,

77
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,565
so bent on such unbending grace.

78
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,319
(Applause)

79
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,921
Thank you.

80
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:59,128
This one is called
"On Donating My Brain to Science."

81
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,344
(Laughter)

82
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,254
Not a problem.

83
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,862
Skip over all the pages
reassuring religious people.

84
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,036
Already a universal donor:
kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,282
tissue, heart, veins, whatever.

86
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:19,575
Odd that the modest brain never
imagined its unique value in research,

87
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,913
maybe saving someone else from what it is
they're not quite sure I have.

88
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,170
Flattering, that.

89
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,818
So fill in the forms,

90
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:29,701
drill through the answers,

91
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,688
trill out a blithe spirit.

92
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:36,000
And slice me, dice me,
spread me on your slides.

93
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,666
Find what I'm trying to tell you.

94
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:43,991
Earn me, learn me, scan me,
squint through your lens.

95
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,694
Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.

96
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:51,182
Be my guest, do your best,
harvest me, track the clues.

97
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,680
This was a good brain while alive.

98
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,060
This was a brain that paid its dues.

99
00:05:56,084 --> 00:06:00,975
So slice me, dice me,
smear me on your slides,

100
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,520
stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.

101
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,620
Share me, hear me:

102
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,244
I want to be used
I want to be used

103
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,314
I want to be used
up.

104
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,933
(Applause)

105
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:21,260
(Applause ends)

106
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,531
And this one's called "The Ghost Light."

107
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,779
Lit from within is the sole secure way

108
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,797
to traverse dark matter.

109
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:37,421
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms,
snails, jellyfish, worms --

110
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,717
glow bioluminescent,

111
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,510
and people as well;

112
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,786
we emit infra-red light
from our most lucent selves.

113
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,602
Our tragedy is we can't see it.

114
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,258
We see by reflecting.

115
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:56,701
We need biofluorescence
to show our true colors.

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,503
External illumination can distort, though.

117
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:02,529
When gravity bends light,

118
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:06,162
huge galaxy clusters
can act as telescopes,

119
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:11,363
elongating background images
of star systems to faint arcs --

120
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:12,541
a lensing effect

121
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,508
like viewing distant street lamps
through a glass of wine.

122
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,242
A glass of wine or two now makes me weave

123
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:23,128
as if acting the drunkard's part;

124
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,498
as if, besotted with unrequited love

125
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:30,607
for the dynamic Turner canvasses
spied out by the Hubble,

126
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,912
I could lurch down a city street set

127
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:36,855
without provoking
every pedestrian walk-on stare.

128
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,924
Stare as long as you need to.

129
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:45,841
If you think about it, walking,
even standing, is illogical --

130
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,841
such tiny things, feet! --

131
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:49,782
(Laughter)

132
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:53,717
especially when one's body
is not al dente anymore.

133
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:57,327
(Laughter)

134
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,851
Besides, creature of extremes and excess,

135
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,911
I've always thought Apollo
beautiful but boring,

136
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,919
and a bit of a dumb blonde.

137
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,748
Dionysians don't do balance.

138
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,574
Balance, in other words,
has never been my strong point.

139
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,272
But I digress.

140
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,511
More and more these days,

141
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:20,533
digression seems
the most direct route through

142
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,634
from where I've lost or found myself

143
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,349
out of place, mind, turn, time.

144
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:31,558
Place your foot just so,
mind how you turn:

145
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:34,359
too swift a swivel can bring you down.

146
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:38,134
Take your time ushering the audience out,

147
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,190
saying goodbye to the actors.

148
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,199
The ghost light

149
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,009
is what they call the single bulb

150
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:47,634
hanging above the bare stage
in an empty theater.

151
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,968
In the empty theater of such a night,

152
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:54,810
waking to meet no external radiance,

153
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,026
this is the final struggle left to win,

154
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,285
this the sole beacon
to beckon the darkness in

155
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,954
and let the rest begin,

156
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:08,931
this the lens through which at last
to see both Self and Other

157
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:13,575
arrayed with the bright stain
of original sin:

158
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,051
lit from within.

159
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,825
(Applause)

160
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,107
And this is the last one.

161
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,103
"This Dark Hour"

162
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:32,028
Late summer, 4 A.M.

163
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:35,020
The rain slows to a stop,

164
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,292
dripping still from the broad leaves

165
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:40,503
of blue hostas unseen
in the garden's dark.

166
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:44,953
Barefoot, careful
on the slick slate slabs,

167
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:48,260
I need no light, I know the way,

168
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,163
stoop by the mint bed,

169
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,992
scoop a fistful of moist earth,

170
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,724
then grope for a chair,

171
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:57,402
spread a shawl, and sit,

172
00:09:57,426 --> 00:10:01,184
breathing in the wet green August air.

173
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,230
This is the small, still hour

174
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:09,068
before the newspaper
lands in the vestibule like a grenade,

175
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:13,663
the phone shrills, the computer screen
blinks and glares awake.

176
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,823
There is this hour:

177
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:20,823
poem in my head, soil in my hand:

178
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,793
unnamable fullness.

179
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,245
This hour, when blood of my blood

180
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,301
bone of bone, child grown
to manhood now --

181
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:35,789
stranger, intimate,
not distant but apart --

182
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:39,547
lies safe, off dreaming melodies

183
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,100
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.

184
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,340
To have come to this place,

185
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,455
lived to this moment:

186
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,594
immeasurable lightness.

187
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:54,313
The density of black starts to blur umber.

188
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,767
Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,

189
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,802
then the mourning dove's elegy.

190
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,780
Sable glimmers toward grey;

191
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,972
objects emerge, trailing shadows;

192
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,971
night ages toward day.

193
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,006
The city stirs.

194
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,858
There will be other dawns,
nights, gaudy noons.

195
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,417
Likely, I'll lose my way.

196
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,272
There will be stumbling, falling,

197
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,537
cursing the dark.

198
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,110
Whatever comes,

199
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:28,081
there was this hour when nothing mattered,

200
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,786
all was unbearably dear.

201
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,116
And when I'm done with daylights,

202
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,101
should those who loved me
grieve too long a while,

203
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,354
let them remember that I had this hour --

204
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:45,986
this dark, perfect hour --

205
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,412
and smile.

206
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:49,572
Thank you.

207
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:55,948
(Applause)
