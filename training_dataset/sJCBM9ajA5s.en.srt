0
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:15,388
We all go to doctors.

1
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:21,282
And we do so with trust and blind faith

2
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:25,164
that the test they are ordering
and the medications they're prescribing

3
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:28,363
are based upon evidence --

4
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:31,314
evidence that's designed to help us.

5
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:38,181
However, the reality is that that hasn't
always been the case for everyone.

6
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,381
What if I told you

7
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:44,351
that the medical science discovered
over the past century

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,042
has been based on only
half the population?

9
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

10
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:54,400
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,389
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

12
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,652
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,

13
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:07,341
but no matter who walks
through the door to the ER,

14
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:09,817
we order the same tests,

15
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:11,975
we prescribe the same medication,

16
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:16,401
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,624
Why would we?

18
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:22,794
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.

19
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:27,377
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

20
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,552
withdrawn from the market

21
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:31,969
are due to side effects on women.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,391
So let's think about that for a minute.

23
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:39,289
Why are we discovering
side effects on women

24
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:42,599
only after a drug has been
released to the market?

25
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:49,156
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,337
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

27
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,329
to animal studies,

28
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:56,480
to then clinical trials on humans,

29
00:01:56,504 --> 00:02:00,375
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,

30
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,735
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,540
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding

32
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:11,946
it takes to go through that process.

33
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:16,549
So why are we discovering
unacceptable side effects

34
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:21,024
on half the population
after that has gone through?

35
00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:24,427
What's happening?

36
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,881
Well, it turns out that those cells
used in that laboratory,

37
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,835
they're male cells,

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,261
and the animals used
in the animal studies were male animals,

39
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:39,375
and the clinical trials have been
performed almost exclusively on men.

40
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:46,530
How is it that the male model became
our framework for medical research?

41
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:50,625
Let's look at an example that has been
popularized in the media,

42
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:53,855
and it has to do
with the sleep aid Ambien.

43
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,643
Ambien was released on the market
over 20 years ago,

44
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:03,480
and since then, hundreds of millions
of prescriptions have been written,

45
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,952
primarily to women, because women
suffer more sleep disorders than men.

46
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,223
But just this past year,

47
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:14,671
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half

48
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,582
for women only,

49
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:20,443
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug

50
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,380
at a slower rate than men,

51
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,443
causing them to wake up in the morning

52
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:28,661
with more of the active drug
in their system.

53
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:32,615
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,

54
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,606
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.

55
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:40,899
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,

56
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:45,716
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,546
were involved in a motor vehicle accident

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,022
that possibly could have been prevented

59
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:57,161
if this type of analysis was performed
and acted upon 20 years ago

60
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:59,193
when this drug was first released.

61
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:04,284
How many other things need
to be analyzed by gender?

62
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:06,879
What else are we missing?

63
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:13,231
World War II changed a lot of things,

64
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,136
and one of them was this need
to protect people

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,500
from becoming victims of medical research
without informed consent.

66
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:25,143
So some much-needed guidelines
or rules were set into place,

67
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:30,189
and part of that was this desire
to protect women of childbearing age

68
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:33,164
from entering into any
medical research studies.

69
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:38,579
There was fear: what if something
happened to the fetus during the study?

70
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,915
Who would be responsible?

71
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,488
And so the scientists
at this time actually thought

72
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,128
this was a blessing in disguise,

73
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:52,365
because let's face it -- men's bodies
are pretty homogeneous.

74
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:56,313
They don't have the constantly
fluctuating levels of hormones

75
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,081
that could disrupt clean data
they could get if they had only men.

76
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,920
It was easier. It was cheaper.

77
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:08,484
Not to mention, at this time,
there was a general assumption

78
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,733
that men and women
were alike in every way,

79
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:16,200
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.

80
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,028
So it was decided:

81
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:24,633
medical research was performed on men,

82
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,414
and the results were later
applied to women.

83
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,744
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?

84
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:37,024
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:

85
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:41,593
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.

86
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,387
It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."

87
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,105
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,

88
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,614
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community

89
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:56,779
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that

90
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:01,106
by excluding women
from all medical research studies

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,619
we actually did them a disservice,

92
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,975
in that apart from reproductive issues,

93
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,563
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs

94
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,305
of the female patient.

95
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:18,513
Since that time, an overwhelming amount
of evidence has come to light

96
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:24,048
that shows us just how different
men and women are in every way.

97
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:32,050
You know, we have this saying in medicine:

98
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,022
children are not just little adults.

99
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,747
And we say that to remind ourselves

100
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:43,448
that children actually have
a different physiology than normal adults.

101
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:49,635
And it's because of this that the medical
specialty of pediatrics came to light.

102
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,905
And we now conduct research on children
in order to improve their lives.

103
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,936
And I know the same thing
can be said about women.

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,021
Women are not just men
with boobs and tubes.

105
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,117
But they have their own
anatomy and physiology

106
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:13,671
that deserves to be studied
with the same intensity.

107
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,312
Let's take the cardiovascular
system, for example.

108
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,706
This area in medicine has done the most
to try to figure out

109
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,879
why it seems men and women have
completely different heart attacks.

110
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,089
Heart disease is the number one killer
for both men and women,

111
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:37,549
but more women die within the first year
of having a heart attack than men.

112
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:43,063
Men will complain
of crushing chest pain --

113
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,569
an elephant is sitting on their chest.

114
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:47,995
And we call this typical.

115
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,712
Women have chest pain, too.

116
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:59,433
But more women than men
will complain of "just not feeling right,"

117
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,767
"can't seem to get enough air in,"

118
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,765
"just so tired lately."

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,903
And for some reason we call this atypical,

120
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:13,854
even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.

121
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:21,308
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?

122
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,530
If we look at the anatomy,

123
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:30,569
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,

124
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:35,073
and the way that those blood vessels
develop disease is different

125
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,152
in women compared to men.

126
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:43,027
And the test that we use to determine
if someone is at risk for a heart attack,

127
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:47,623
well, they were initially designed
and tested and perfected in men,

128
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:50,781
and so aren't as good
at determining that in women.

129
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,242
And then if we think
about the medications --

130
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,513
common medications
that we use, like aspirin.

131
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:04,294
We give aspirin to healthy men to help
prevent them from having a heart attack,

132
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:08,552
but do you know that if you
give aspirin to a healthy woman,

133
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:10,162
it's actually harmful?

134
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,758
What this is doing is merely telling us

135
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,534
that we are scratching the surface.

136
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:22,571
Emergency medicine
is a fast-paced business.

137
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,916
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,

138
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,916
like cancer and stroke,

139
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,073
are there important differences between
men and women that we could be utilizing?

140
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:41,056
Or even, why is it that some people
get those runny noses

141
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,265
more than others,

142
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:46,616
or why the pain medication that we give
to those stubbed toes

143
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,845
work in some and not in others?

144
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:58,518
The Institute of Medicine has said
every cell has a sex.

145
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,233
What does this mean?

146
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,930
Sex is DNA.

147
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:09,295
Gender is how someone
presents themselves in society.

148
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:12,423
And these two may not always match up,

149
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,613
as we can see with our
transgendered population.

150
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,655
But it's important to realize
that from the moment of conception,

151
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,801
every cell in our bodies --

152
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:27,126
skin, hair, heart and lungs --

153
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,437
contains our own unique DNA,

154
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:34,212
and that DNA contains
the chromosomes that determine

155
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:39,297
whether we become
male or female, man or woman.

156
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,988
It used to be thought

157
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:46,340
that those sex-determining
chromosomes pictured here --

158
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:49,737
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --

159
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:54,975
merely determined whether you
would be born with ovaries or testes,

160
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,740
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced

161
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:03,329
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.

162
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:09,591
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --

163
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,060
or it's at least a little incomplete.

164
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:16,862
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
from the Whitehead Institute,

165
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,860
who works on the Y chromosome,

166
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:21,051
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,

167
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:26,734
they have found evidence that tells us
that those sex-determining chromosomes

168
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,355
that are in every cell in our bodies

169
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:34,738
continue to remain active
for our entire lives

170
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:40,092
and could be what's responsible
for the differences we see

171
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,331
in the dosing of drugs,

172
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:45,321
or why there are differences
between men and women

173
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:48,861
in the susceptibility
and severity of diseases.

174
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:53,952
This new knowledge is the game-changer,

175
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,799
and it's up to those scientists
that continue to find that evidence,

176
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:04,976
but it's up to the clinicians
to start translating this data

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,999
at the bedside, today.

178
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:10,324
Right now.

179
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,474
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization

180
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,481
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,

181
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:24,125
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching

182
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,554
and for patient care.

183
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,748
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.

184
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,224
That's a big job.

185
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:39,301
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.

186
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,882
But I believe in them.

187
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:49,479
I know they're going to see the value
of incorporating the gender lens

188
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,225
into the current curriculum.

189
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:57,216
It's about training the future
health care providers correctly.

190
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:01,588
And regionally,

191
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:05,473
I'm a co-creator of a division within
the Department of Emergency Medicine

192
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,217
here at Brown University,

193
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,851
called Sex and Gender
in Emergency Medicine,

194
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:14,501
and we conduct the research to determine
the differences between men and women

195
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,683
in emergent conditions,

196
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:21,975
like heart disease and stroke
and sepsis and substance abuse,

197
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,376
but we also believe
that education is paramount.

198
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:31,305
We've created a 360-degree
model of education.

199
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:37,287
We have programs for the doctors,
for the nurses, for the students

200
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,017
and for the patients.

201
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:43,569
Because this cannot just be left up
to the health care leaders.

202
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:47,792
We all have a role in making a difference.

203
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,507
But I must warn you: this is not easy.

204
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,432
In fact, it's hard.

205
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:01,538
It's essentially changing the way
we think about medicine

206
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,559
and health and research.

207
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,847
It's changing our relationship
to the health care system.

208
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,648
But there's no going back.

209
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,038
We now know just enough

210
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:19,418
to know that we weren't doing it right.

211
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,990
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,

212
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:28,663
"Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,

213
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,861
but comes through continuous struggle."

214
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,044
And the first step
towards change is awareness.

215
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:40,194
This is not just about improving
medical care for women.

216
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:45,661
This is about personalized,
individualized health care for everyone.

217
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:53,192
This awareness has the power to transform
medical care for men and women.

218
00:14:54,827 --> 00:15:00,515
And from now on, I want you
to ask your doctors

219
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,816
whether the treatments you are receiving
are specific to your sex and gender.

220
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,935
They may not know the answer --

221
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,125
yet.

222
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:14,963
But the conversation has begun,
and together we can all learn.

223
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:20,174
Remember, for me
and my colleagues in this field,

224
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,475
your sex and gender matter.

225
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,531
Thank you.

226
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:28,999
(Applause)
