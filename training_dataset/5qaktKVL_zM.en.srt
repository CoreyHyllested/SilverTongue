0
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:14,912
I am a palliative care physician

1
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:17,927
and I would like to talk to you
today about health care.

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:22,102
I'd like to talk to you
about the health and care

3
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,764
of the most vulnerable
population in our country --

4
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:31,039
those people dealing with the most
complex serious health issues.

5
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:35,004
I'd like to talk to you
about economics as well.

6
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,484
And the intersection of these two
should scare the hell out of you --

7
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,279
it scares the hell out of me.

8
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,874
I'd also like to talk to you
about palliative medicine:

9
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:52,152
a paradigm of care for this population,
grounded in what they value.

10
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:55,741
Patient-centric care based on their values

11
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:59,342
that helps this population
live better and longer.

12
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,808
It's a care model that tells the truth

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,984
and engages one-on-one

14
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,829
and meets people where they're at.

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,223
I'd like to start by telling the story
of my very first patient.

16
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,283
It was my first day as a physician,

17
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:16,798
with the long white coat ...

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,001
I stumbled into the hospital

19
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,825
and right away there's a gentleman,
Harold, 68 years old,

20
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,450
came to the emergency department.

21
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:25,457
He had had headaches for about six weeks

22
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,630
that got worse and worse
and worse and worse.

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,093
Evaluation revealed he had cancer
that had spread to his brain.

24
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:38,443
The attending physician directed me
to go share with Harold and his family

25
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,113
the diagnosis, the prognosis
and options of care.

26
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:47,068
Five hours into my new career,

27
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,126
I did the only thing I knew how.

28
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,206
I walked in,

29
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,134
sat down,

30
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,137
took Harold's hand,

31
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:57,290
took his wife's hand

32
00:01:58,142 --> 00:01:59,419
and just breathed.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,701
He said, "It's not good
news is it, sonny?"

34
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:04,540
I said, "No."

35
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:07,915
And so we talked
and we listened and we shared.

36
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,100
And after a while I said,

37
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:13,349
"Harold, what is it
that has meaning to you?

38
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:15,002
What is it that you hold sacred?"

39
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,341
And he said,

40
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:17,769
"My family."

41
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,546
I said, "What do you want to do?"

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,737
He slapped me on the knee
and said, "I want to go fishing."

43
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,632
I said, "That, I know how to do."

44
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,600
Harold went fishing the next day.

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,392
He died a week later.

46
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:35,074
As I've gone through
my training in my career,

47
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,585
I think back to Harold.

48
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:39,029
And I think that this is a conversation

49
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,966
that happens far too infrequently.

50
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:47,502
And it's a conversation
that had led us to crisis,

51
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,837
to the biggest threat
to the American way of life today,

52
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:52,967
which is health care expenditures.

53
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,103
So what do we know?

54
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:58,056
We know that
this population, the most ill,

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,664
takes up 15 percent
of the gross domestic product --

56
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,482
nearly 2,3 trillion dollars.

57
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:07,867
So the sickest 15 percent
take up 15 percent of the GDP.

58
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:11,056
If we extrapolate this out
over the next two decades

59
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,746
with the growth of baby boomers,

60
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:18,754
at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.

61
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:22,456
Sixty percent of the gross
domestic product

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,104
of the United States of America --

63
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,822
it has very little to do
with health care at that point.

64
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:28,962
It has to do with a gallon of milk,

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,064
with college tuition.

66
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,088
It has to do with
every thing that we value

67
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:37,237
and every thing that we know presently.

68
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:42,705
It has at stake the free-market
economy and capitalism

69
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,483
of the United States of America.

70
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:50,121
Let's forget all the statistics
for a minute, forget the numbers.

71
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,525
Let's talk about the value we get
for all these dollars we spend.

72
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:57,415
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,
about six years ago,

73
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,192
looked at every dollar
spent by Medicare --

74
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,827
generally this population.

75
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:05,787
We found that those patients who have
the highest per capita expenditures

76
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,425
had the highest suffering,
pain, depression.

77
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:14,743
And, more often than not, they die sooner.

78
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,349
How can this be?

79
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,193
We live in the United States,

80
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,707
it has the greatest health care
system on the planet.

81
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,236
We spend 10 times more on these patients

82
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,446
than the second-leading
country in the world.

83
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,649
That doesn't make sense.

84
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:31,123
But what we know is,

85
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:34,318
out of the top 50 countries on the planet

86
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,925
with organized health care systems,

87
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,047
we rank 37th.

88
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:46,303
Former Eastern Bloc countries
and sub-Saharan African countries

89
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,863
rank higher than us
as far as quality and value.

90
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:55,023
Something I experience
every day in my practice,

91
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:59,100
and I'm sure, something many of you
on your own journeys have experienced:

92
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,807
more is not more.

93
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,185
Those individuals who had more tests,

94
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,479
more bells, more whistles,

95
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,931
more chemotherapy,
more surgery, more whatever --

96
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:12,404
the more that we do to someone,

97
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,880
it decreases the quality of their life.

98
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,693
And it shortens it, most often.

99
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,721
So what are we going to do about this?

100
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,148
What are we doing about this?

101
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,073
And why is this so?

102
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:29,001
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,

103
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,423
is that we, the health care industry --
long white-coat physicians --

104
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,857
are stealing from you.

105
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,068
Stealing from you the opportunity

106
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:40,334
to choose how you want to live your lives

107
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:42,839
in the context of whatever disease it is.

108
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,632
We focus on disease
and pathology and surgery

109
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:47,037
and pharmacology.

110
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,395
We miss the human being.

111
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,961
How can we treat this

112
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,778
without understanding this?

113
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,968
We do things to this;

114
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:06,425
we need to do things for this.

115
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,941
The triple aim of healthcare:

116
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:13,057
one, improve patient experience.

117
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,275
Two, improve the population health.

118
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:22,250
Three, decrease per capita expenditure
across a continuum.

119
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,334
Our group, palliative care,

120
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:29,375
in 2012, working with
the sickest of the sick --

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,151
cancer,

122
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,520
heart disease, lung disease,

123
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,168
renal disease,

124
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:36,389
dementia --

125
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,839
how did we improve patient experience?

126
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,609
"I want to be at home, Doc."

127
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,844
"OK, we'll bring the care to you."

128
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,680
Quality of life, enhanced.

129
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,090
Think about the human being.

130
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,045
Two: population health.

131
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,920
How did we look
at this population differently,

132
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:56,792
and engage with them
at a different level, a deeper level,

133
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,017
and connect to a broader sense
of the human condition than my own?

134
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,675
How do we manage this group,

135
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,353
so that of our outpatient population,

136
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:11,275
94 percent, in 2012,
never had to go to the hospital?

137
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,552
Not because they couldn't.

138
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:16,998
But they didn't have to.

139
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,751
We brought the care to them.

140
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,385
We maintained their value, their quality.

141
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,227
Number three: per capita expenditures.

142
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:30,144
For this population,

143
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:35,221
that today is 2,3 trillion dollars
and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,

144
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:39,979
we reduced health care expenditures
by nearly 70 percent.

145
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:44,322
They got more of what they wanted
based on their values,

146
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,405
lived better and are living longer,

147
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:49,233
for two-thirds less money.

148
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,915
While Harold's time was limited,

149
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,564
palliative care's is not.

150
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:04,964
Palliative care is a paradigm
from diagnosis through the end of life.

151
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:07,854
The hours,

152
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,753
weeks, months, years,

153
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,074
across a continuum --

154
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:14,982
with treatment, without treatment.

155
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,362
Meet Christine.

156
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,127
Stage III cervical cancer,

157
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:22,172
so, metastatic cancer
that started in her cervix,

158
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:23,679
spread throughout her body.

159
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,362
She's in her 50s and she is living.

160
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,336
This is not about end of life,

161
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,875
this is about life.

162
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,070
This is not just about the elderly,

163
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,756
this is about people.

164
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,141
This is Richard.

165
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,347
End-stage lung disease.

166
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:44,853
"Richard, what is it
that you hold sacred?"

167
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:48,596
"My kids, my wife and my Harley."

168
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,105
(Laughter)

169
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,279
"Alright!

170
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,782
I can't drive you around on it
because I can barely pedal a bicycle,

171
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,297
but let's see what we can do."

172
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,922
Richard came to me,

173
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:03,843
and he was in rough shape.

174
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,225
He had this little voice telling him

175
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,650
that maybe his time was weeks to months.

176
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,754
And then we just talked.

177
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:14,867
And I listened and tried to hear --

178
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,178
big difference.

179
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,371
Use these in proportion to this.

180
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,004
I said, "Alright, let's take it
one day at a time,"

181
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,555
like we do in every
other chapter of our life.

182
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:30,982
And we have met Richard
where Richard's at day-to-day.

183
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:34,028
And it's a phone call or two a week,

184
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,222
but he's thriving in the context
of end-stage lung disease.

185
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,533
Now, palliative medicine is not
just for the elderly,

186
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:48,161
it is not just for the middle-aged.

187
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,066
It is for everyone.

188
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,629
Meet my friend Jonathan.

189
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:55,383
We have the honor and pleasure

190
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,727
of Jonathan and his father
joining us here today.

191
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,583
Jonathan is in his 20s,
and I met him several years ago.

192
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,929
He was dealing with
metastatic testicular cancer,

193
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,952
spread to his brain.

194
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:07,647
He had a stroke,

195
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,923
he had brain surgery,

196
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,959
radiation, chemotherapy.

197
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,375
Upon meeting him and his family,

198
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,230
he was a couple of weeks away
from a bone marrow transplant,

199
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,515
and in listening and engaging,

200
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,585
they said, "Help us
understand -- what is cancer?"

201
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:29,417
How did we get this far

202
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,814
without understanding
what we're dealing with?

203
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,690
How did we get this far
without empowering somebody

204
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:37,626
to know what it is they're dealing with,

205
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,258
and then taking the next step and engaging
in who they are as human beings

206
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,378
to know if that is what we should do?

207
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,481
Lord knows we can do
any kind of thing to you.

208
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,338
But should we?

209
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,554
And don't take my word for it.

210
00:10:55,578 --> 00:11:00,030
All the evidence that is related
to palliative care these days

211
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:04,175
demonstrates with absolute certainty
people live better and live longer.

212
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:07,543
There was a seminal article
out of the New England Journal of Medicine

213
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,717
in 2010.

214
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:12,285
A study done at Harvard
by friends of mine, colleagues.

215
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,690
End-stage lung cancer:

216
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,832
one group with palliative care,

217
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,377
a similar group without.

218
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:23,134
The group with palliative care
reported less pain,

219
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,118
less depression.

220
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,463
They needed fewer hospitalizations.

221
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,894
And, ladies and gentlemen,

222
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,282
they lived three to six months longer.

223
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:39,246
If palliative care were a cancer drug,

224
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,284
every cancer doctor on the planet
would write a prescription for it.

225
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,059
Why don't they?

226
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,914
Again, because we goofy,
long white-coat physicians

227
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:54,984
are trained and of the mantra
of dealing with this,

228
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:57,635
not with this.

229
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:06,441
This is a space that we will
all come to at some point.

230
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,433
But this conversation today
is not about dying,

231
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:11,830
it is about living.

232
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:13,613
Living based on our values,

233
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,056
what we find sacred

234
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,497
and how we want to write
the chapters of our lives,

235
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,355
whether it's the last

236
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,776
or the last five.

237
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,672
What we know,

238
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,664
what we have proven,

239
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:29,012
is that this conversation
needs to happen today --

240
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:32,005
not next week, not next year.

241
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,859
What is at stake is our lives today

242
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:36,683
and the lives of us as we get older

243
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,247
and the lives of our children
and our grandchildren.

244
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,183
Not just in that hospital room

245
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,117
or on the couch at home,

246
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,529
but everywhere we go
and everything we see.

247
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:53,546
Palliative medicine is the answer
to engage with human beings,

248
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,024
to change the journey
that we will all face,

249
00:12:58,304 --> 00:12:59,804
and change it for the better.

250
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,555
To my colleagues,

251
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,087
to my patients,

252
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,876
to my government,

253
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:10,362
to all human beings,

254
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,756
I ask that we stand and we
shout and we demand

255
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:16,232
the best care possible,

256
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,582
so that we can live better today

257
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,287
and ensure a better life tomorrow.

258
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,278
We need to shift today

259
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,333
so that we can live tomorrow.

260
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:29,989
Thank you very much.

261
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:31,301
(Applause)
