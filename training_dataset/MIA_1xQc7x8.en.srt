0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,416
I have one more reason for optimism:

1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,896
climate change.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,680
Maybe you don't believe it,
but here is the fact.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,800
On December 12, 2015,

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,216
in Paris, under the United Nations,

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,696
195 governments got together

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,880
and unanimously --

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,816
if you've worked with governments,
you know how difficult that is --

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,056
unanimously decided

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,896
to intentionally change the course
of the global economy

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,736
in order to protect the most vulnerable

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,416
and improve the life of all of us.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,856
Now, that is a remarkable achievement.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,096
(Applause)

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,256
But it is even more remarkable

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,256
if you consider where we had been
just a few years ago.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,936
2009, Copenhagen.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,600
Who remembers Copenhagen?

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,736
Well, after years of working
toward a climate agreement,

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,920
the same governments
convened in Copenhagen

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,040
and failed miserably.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,016
Why did it fail miserably?

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,616
For many different reasons,

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,176
but primarily because
of the deeply entrenched divide

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,920
between the global
North and the global South.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,616
So now, six months after this failure,

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,976
I was called in
to assume the responsibility

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,056
of the global climate change negotiations.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,456
You can imagine, the perfect moment
to start this new job.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,176
The global mood on climate change
was in the trash can.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,656
No one believed

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,640
that a global agreement
could ever be possible.

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,200
In fact, neither did I.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,976
If you promise not to tell anyone
outside of this wonderful TED audience,

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,096
I'm going to divulge a secret

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,480
that has been gratefully
buried by history.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,296
On my first press conference,

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,696
a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,096
do you think that a global agreement
is ever going to be possible?"

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,456
And without engaging brain,
I heard me utter,

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
"Not in my lifetime."

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,776
Well, you can imagine
the faces of my press team

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,496
who were horrified
at this crazy Costa Rican woman

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,920
who was their new boss.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,336
And I was horrified, too.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,616
Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
because I'm kind of used to myself.

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,816
I was actually horrified

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,536
at the consequences
of what I had just said,

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,736
at the consequences for the world

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,160
in which all our children
are going to have to live.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,056
It was frankly a horrible moment for me,

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,176
and I thought, well, no, hang on,

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,816
hang on.

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,656
Impossible is not a fact,

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,120
it's an attitude.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,176
It's only an attitude.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,136
And I decided right then and there
that I was going to change my attitude

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,800
and I was going to help the world
change its attitude on climate change.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,736
So I don't know --

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,736
No, just this? Thanks.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,960
I don't know --

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,656
what you would do

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,120
if you were told
your job is to save the planet.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Put that on the job description.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,696
And you have full responsibility,

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,856
but you have absolutely no authority,

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,720
because governments are sovereign
in every decision that they take.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,016
Well, I would really love to know

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,296
what you would do
on the first Monday morning,

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,736
but here's what I did: I panicked.

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,416
(Laughter)

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,936
And then I panicked again,

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,000
because I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,856
And then I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem,

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,816
but I do know one thing:

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,816
we have got to change
the tone of this conversation.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,936
Because there is no way
you can deliver victory

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
without optimism.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,616
And here,

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,176
I use optimism as a very simple word,

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,976
but let's understand it
in its broader sense.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,896
Let's understand it as courage,

82
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,896
hope, trust, solidarity,

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,816
the fundamental belief
that we humans can come together

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
and can help each other
to better the fate of mankind.

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,416
Well, you can imagine
that I thought that without that,

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,896
there was no way we were going
to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,736
And for six years,

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,616
I have stubbornly, relentlessly
injected optimism into the system,

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,496
no matter what the questions
from the press --

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,696
and I have gotten better at those --

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,896
and no matter what the evidence
to the contrary.

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,400
And believe you me, there has been
a lot of contrary evidence.

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,640
But relentless optimism into the system.

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,856
And pretty soon,

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,216
we began to see changes
happening in many areas,

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,496
precipitated by thousands of people,

97
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,136
including many of you here today,

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
and I thank you.

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,136
And this TED community
will not be surprised

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,776
if I tell you the first area

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,936
in which we saw remarkable change

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
was ...

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
technology.

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,216
We began to see that clean technologies,

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,696
in particular renewable
energy technologies,

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,336
began to drop price
and increase in capacity,

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,416
to the point where today
we are already building

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,176
concentrated solar power plants

109
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,656
that have the capacity
to power entire cities,

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,816
to say nothing of the fact
of what we are doing on mobility

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
and intelligent buildings.

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,216
And with this shift in technologies,

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,416
we were able to begin to understand

114
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,000
that there was a shift
in the economic equation,

115
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,816
because we were able to recognize

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,936
that yes, there are
huge costs to climate change,

117
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,496
and yes, there are compounded risks.

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,176
But there also are economic advantages

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,896
and intrinsic benefits,

120
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,856
because the dissemination
of the clean technologies

121
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
is going to bring us cleaner air,

122
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,016
better health,

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,576
better transportation,
more livable cities,

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,136
more energy security,

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,616
more energy access
to the developing world.

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,680
In sum, a better world
than what we have now.

127
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
And with that understanding,

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,336
you should have witnessed,
in fact, part of you were,

129
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,696
the spread of ingenuity and excitement

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,736
that went through,
first through nonnational governments,

131
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,896
the private sector, captains of industry,
insurance companies,

132
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,216
investors, city leaders,
faith communities,

133
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,576
because they all began to understand,
this actually can be in their interest.

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,120
This can actually
improve their bottom line.

135
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,600
And it wasn't just the usual suspects.

136
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,056
I have to tell you I had the CEO
of a major, major oil and gas company

137
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,416
come to me at the beginning of last year

138
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,640
and say --

139
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,280
privately, of course --

140
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,136
he did not know how
he was going to change his company,

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,336
but he is going to change it,

142
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,040
because he's interested
in long-term viability.

143
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,016
Well, now we have a shift
in the economic equation,

144
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,376
and with that, with broader
support from everyone,

145
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,776
it did not take very long
before we saw that national governments

146
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,656
woke up to the fact
that this is in their national interest.

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,816
And when we asked countries
to begin to identify

148
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,736
how they could contribute
to global efforts

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,096
but based on their national interest,

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,376
189 countries out of 195,

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,736
189 countries sent their
comprehensive climate change plans,

152
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,895
based on their national interest,

153
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,816
concurrent with their priorities,

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,320
consistent with their national
sustainable development plans.

155
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,880
Well,

156
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,976
once you protect
the core interests of nations,

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,656
then you can understand
that nations were ready

158
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,296
to begin to converge onto a common path,

159
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,576
onto a common direction of travel

160
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,736
that is going to take us
probably several decades,

161
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,256
but over those several decades
is going to take us

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,736
into the new economy,

163
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,336
into a decarbonized,
highly resilient economy,

164
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,736
And the national contributions
that are currently on the table

165
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,056
on behalf of national governments

166
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,216
are insufficient to get us
to a stabilized climate,

167
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,296
but they are only the first step,

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,336
and they will improve over time.

169
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,776
And the measurement, reporting
and verification of all of those efforts

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,456
is legally binding.

171
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,216
And the checkpoints that we're
going to have every five years

172
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,736
to assess collective progress
towards our goal are legally binding,

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,656
and the path itself toward
a decarbonized and more resilient economy

174
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,880
is legally binding.

175
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,496
And here's the more important part:

176
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,936
What did we have before?

177
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,016
A very small handful of countries

178
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,280
who had undertaken very reduced,

179
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,376
short-term emission reduction commitments

180
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,576
that were completely insufficient

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,016
and furthermore,
largely perceived as a burden.

182
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,456
Now what do we have?

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,056
Now we have all countries of the world
contributing with different intensities

184
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,376
from different approaches
in different sectors,

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,880
but all of them
contributing to a common goal

186
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,496
and along a path

187
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,560
with environmental integrity.

188
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,456
Well, once you have all of this in place

189
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,696
and you have shifted this understanding,

190
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,096
then you see that governments
were able to go to Paris

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,656
and adopt the Paris agreement.

192
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
(Applause)

193
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
So,

194
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,800
as I look back

195
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,560
over the past six years,

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
first I remember

197
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,080
the day the Paris agreement was adopted.

198
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,376
I cannot tell you
the euphoria in the room.

199
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,776
5,000 people jumping out of their seats,

200
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,456
crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,

201
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,776
torn between euphoria and still disbelief
at what they had just seen,

202
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,640
because so many people

203
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,120
had worked for years towards this,
and this was finally their reality.

204
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
And it wasn't just those
who had participated directly.

205
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,376
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague

206
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,216
who was trying to decide

207
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,440
on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted
to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,200
And once he had finally decided
what he was going to buy,

209
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,976
the jeweler said to him,

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,816
"You know, you're very lucky
that you're buying this now,

211
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,520
because these pearls could go extinct
very soon because of climate change."

212
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,776
"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,

213
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,576
the governments
have just come to a decision,

214
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,840
and Tahiti could have a chance."

215
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,016
Well, what a fantastic confirmation

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,056
that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,

217
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
here is a possible chance.

218
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,296
I'm the first one to recognize
that we have a lot of work still to do.

219
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,656
We've only just started
our work on climate change.

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,376
And in fact, we need to make sure
that we redouble our efforts

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,200
over the next five years
that are the urgent five years.

222
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,496
But I do believe

223
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,456
that we have come over the past six years

224
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,680
from the impossible

225
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,536
to the now unstoppable.

226
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,616
And how did we do that?
By injecting transformational optimism

227
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,096
that allowed us to go
from confrontation to collaboration,

228
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,416
that allowed us to understand
that national and local interests

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,816
are not necessarily at odds
with global needs,

230
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,555
and that if we understand that,
we can bring them together

231
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,816
and we can merge them harmoniously.

232
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,576
And as I look forward
to other global issues

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,456
that will require
our attention this century --

234
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,960
food security, water security,
home security, forced migration --

235
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,496
I see that we certainly do not know

236
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,056
how we are going to solve
those problems yet.

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,776
But we can take a page
out of what we have done on climate change

238
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,056
and we can understand

239
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,376
that we have got to reinterpret
the zero-sum mentality.

240
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,376
Because we were trained to believe
that there always are winners and losers,

241
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,040
and that your loss is my gain.

242
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,736
Well, now that we're in a world

243
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,696
in which we have reached
planetary boundaries

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,376
and that we are not
just so interconnected,

245
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,816
but increasingly
interdependent on each other,

246
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,000
your loss is no longer my gain.

247
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,240
We're either all losers

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,896
or we all can be winners.

249
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,216
But we are going to have to decide

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,400
between zero and sum.

251
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,896
We're going to have to decide
between zero benefit for all

252
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,896
or living life as the sum of all of us.

253
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,256
We've done it once. We can do it again.

254
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,496
Thanks.

255
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,948
(Applause)
