0
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,376
So when I decided to create
an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,

1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,376
the neighborhood of the Cairo
garbage collectors in Egypt,

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,216
I never thought this project would be

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,920
the most amazing human experience
that I would ever live.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,336
As an artist, I had
this humanist intention

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,736
of beautifying a poor
and neglected neighborhood

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,840
by bringing art to it and hopefully
shining light on this isolated community.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,616
The first time I heard about
this Christian Coptic community

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,056
was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
under the regime of Hosni Mubarak

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,880
decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
using the pretext of H1N1 virus.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,496
Originally, they are pig breeders.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,696
Their pigs and other animals
are fed with the organic waste

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,696
that they collect on a daily basis.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,480
This event killed their livelihood.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,536
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
it felt like a maze.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,256
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,456
So you go right, then straight,
then right again, then left

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,176
to reach all the way to the top.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,616
But to reach there, you must dodge between
the trucks overpacked with garbage

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,216
and slalom between the tuk-tuks,

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,440
the fastest vehicle to move around
in the neighborhood.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,176
The smell of the garbage
unloaded from those trucks was intense,

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,576
and the noise of the traffic
was loud and overbearing.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,280
Add to it the din created by the crushers
in those warehouses along the way.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,360
From outside it looks chaotic,
but everything is perfectly organized.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,056
The Zaraeeb, that’s how
they call themselves,

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,616
which means the pig breeders,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,016
have been collecting the garbage of Cairo

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,816
and sorting it in their own
neighborhood for decades.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,976
They have developed
one of the most efficient

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,296
and highly profitable systems
on a global level.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,936
Still, the place is perceived
as dirty, marginalized and segregated

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,040
because of their association
with the trash.

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,936
So my initial idea
was to create an anamorphic piece,

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,816
a piece that you can only see
from one vantage point.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,176
I wanted to challenge myself artistically
by painting over several buildings

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,336
and having it only fully visible
from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,936
The Muqattam Mountain
is the pride of the community.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,416
This is where they built
the St. Simon Monastery,

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,560
a 10,000-seat cave church
that they carved into the mountain itself.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,256
So, the first time
I stood on top of the mountain

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,896
and I looked at the neighborhood,

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,816
I asked myself, how on earth
will I convince all those owners

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,016
to let me paint on their buildings?

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,416
And then Magd came.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,816
Magd is a guide from the Church.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,936
He told me the only person I needed
to convince was Father Samaan,

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,416
who is the leader of the community.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,656
But to convince Father Samaan,
I needed to convince Mario,

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,736
who is a Polish artist
who moved to Cairo 20 years ago

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,576
and who created all the artwork
of the Cave Church.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,520
I am really grateful to Mario.
He was the key of the project.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,656
He managed to get me
a meeting with Father Samaan,

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,416
and surprisingly, he loved the idea.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,696
He asked me about where I painted before

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,176
and how I will make it happen.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,400
And he was mainly concerned
by what I was going to write.

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,896
In every work that I create,
I write messages

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,696
with my style of Arabic calligraphy.

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,456
I make sure those messages are relevant
to the place where I am painting

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,100
but have this universal dimension,

61
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,924
so anybody around the world
can relate to it.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,816
So for Manshiyat Naser,

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,616
I decided to write in Arabic
the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,576
a Coptic bishop from the third century,

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,176
who said: (Arabic),

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,456
which means in English,

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,616
"Anyone who wants
to see the sunlight clearly

68
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,120
needs to wipe his eyes first."

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,576
It was really important for me

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,496
that the community
felt connected to the words.

71
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,960
And for me this quote was perfectly
reflecting the spirit of the project.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,896
So Father Samaan blessed the project,

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,880
and his approval brought
all the residents on board.

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,936
Hundreds of liters of paint,
a dozen blue manual lifts,

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,096
several trips back and forth to Cairo,

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,256
a strong and solid team from France,
North Africa, Middle East and the US,

77
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,736
and after a year of planning
and logistics, there we are,

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,376
my team and some members
from the local community

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,896
creating a piece that will
spread over 50 buildings,

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,816
some filling up the space
of the calligraphy

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,256
that I trace with colors.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,336
Here some blue, there some yellow,
there some orange.

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,495
Some others carrying some sand bags

84
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,616
and putting them
on the top of the buildings

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,976
to hold those manual lifts,

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,896
and some others assembling
and disassembling those same lifts

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
and moving them around
the different buildings.

88
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,896
At the beginning of the project,

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,576
I numbered all those
buildings on my sketch,

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,096
and there was no real interaction
with the community.

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,256
People didn’t get the point of all this.

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,776
But fast enough, those building numbers
became family names.

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,400
The first building
was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,176
Uncle Ibrahim is such
an enthusiastic person.

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,256
He was always singing and making jokes,

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,616
and his daughters and sons
saved me from his bull

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,096
who wanted to attack me
on the fourth floor.

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,416
(Laughter)

99
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,736
Actually, the bull saw me from the window
and came out on the balcony.

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,096
(Laughter)

101
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
Yeah.

102
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,336
Uncle Ibrahim was always
hanging out on the balcony

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,336
and talking to me while I was painting.

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,336
I remember him saying that he didn’t
go to the mountain for 10 years,

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,176
and that he never takes a day off.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,976
He said that if he stopped working,
who will stop the garbage?

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,416
But surprisingly,
at the end of the project,

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,256
he came all the way to the mountain
to look at the piece.

109
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,056
He was really proud
to see his house painted,

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,840
and he said that this project
was a project of peace and --

111
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
sorry --

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,560
(Applause)

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Thank you.

114
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,296
He said that it was a project
of peace and unity

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
and that it brought people together.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,896
So his perception
towards the project changed,

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,816
and my perception towards
the community changed also,

118
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,776
and towards what they do.

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,416
All the garbage that everybody
is disgusted by is not theirs.

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,936
They just work out of it.

121
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,216
Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.
They live from the garbage.

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,456
So I started doubting myself and wondering

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,256
what was the real purpose
of this whole project?

124
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,376
It was not about beautifying
a place by bringing art to it.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,456
It was about switching perception
and opening a dialogue

126
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,640
on the connection that we have
with communities that we don’t know.

127
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,776
So day after day,

128
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,176
the calligraphy circle was taking shape,

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,256
and we were always excited to go back
on the mountain to look at the piece.

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,416
And standing exactly at this point
every day made my realize

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,256
the symbolism behind
this anamorphic piece.

132
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,456
If you want to see
the real image of somebody,

133
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,440
maybe you should change your angle.

134
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,256
There was doubts and difficulties,

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,536
like fears and stress.

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,736
It wasn't simple
to work in such environments,

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,976
sometimes having pigs under you
while you paint

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,816
or climbing a stack of garbage
to reach a lift.

139
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,176
But we all got over the fear
of the heights, the swinging lifts,

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,456
the strength of the smell

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,616
and also the stress
of not finishing on time.

142
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,880
But the kindness of all those people
made us forget everything.

143
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,776
The building number 3 was the house
of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.

144
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,056
In Egyptian, they have
this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"

145
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,616
which means "the best people."

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,896
They were the best people.

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,056
We used to take our break
in front of their houses,

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,456
and all the kids of the neighborhood

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,816
used to join us.

150
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,176
I was impressed and amazed
by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.

151
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,336
For the first few days, they were always
refusing anything we were offering them,

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,416
even a snack or a drink.

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,376
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,256
And she told me they teach
their kids to refuse anything

155
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,936
from somebody that they don't know

156
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
because maybe this person
needs it more than they do.

157
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,896
So at this exact point I realized actually

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,056
the Zaraeeb community
was the ideal context

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,680
to raise the topic of perception.

160
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,536
We need to question
our level of misconception

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,216
and judgment we can have as a society

162
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
upon communities
based on their differences.

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,416
I remember how we got delayed
on Uncle Ibrahim's house

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,576
when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop

165
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,176
were eating the sand bags
that hold the lifts.

166
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
(Laughter)

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,576
The house of Uncle Bakheet
and Aunty Fareeda

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,256
was this kind of meeting point.

169
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,135
Everybody used to gather there.

170
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,096
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant

171
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,736
when he said that was
a project of peace and unity,

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,559
because I really felt
that people were coming together.

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,496
Everyone was greeting us
with a smile, offering us a drink

174
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,536
or inviting us into their
own house for lunch.

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,576
Sometime, you are
at the first level of a building,

176
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,136
and somebody opens his window
and offers you some tea.

177
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,616
And then the same thing happens
on the second floor.

178
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,656
And you keep going all the way to the top.

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,896
(Laughter)

180
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,376
(Applause)

181
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,856
I think I never drink as much tea
as I did in Egypt.

182
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,696
(Laughter)

183
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,456
And to be honest with you,
we could have finished earlier,

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,656
but I think it took us three weeks
because of all those tea breaks.

185
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,480
(Laughter)

186
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,056
In Egypt, they have another expression,
which is "Nawartouna,"

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,200
which means, "You brought light to us."

188
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,096
In Manshiyat Naser
they were always telling us this.

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,256
The calligraphy, actually --

190
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,336
I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
for the calligraphy

191
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,536
so at the end of the project,
we rented some black light projectors

192
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,936
and lit up the whole neighborhood,

193
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,336
surprising everybody around.

194
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,616
We wanted to tell them

195
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,840
that they are the ones
who brought light to us.

196
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,560
(Applause)

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,056
The Zaraeeb community
are strong, honest, hard workers,

198
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,816
and they know their value.

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,976
The people of Cairo
call them "the Zabaleen,"

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,976
which means "the people of the garbage,"

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,736
but ironically,
the people of Manshiyat Naser

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,616
call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,576
They say, they are the ones
who produce the garbage, not them.

204
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,816
(Laughter)

205
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,216
(Applause)

206
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,616
The goal was to leave something
to this community,

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,776
but I feel that they are the ones
who left something in our lives.

208
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,896
You know, the art project
was just a pretext

209
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,576
for this amazing human experience.

210
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,016
The art piece at some point
will disappear, vanish,

211
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,936
and actually there is somebody
who is building a second floor

212
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,616
in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,

213
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,496
so it's covering part of the painting,

214
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,656
so I might need to go back
and paint over it.

215
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,296
(Laughter)

216
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,696
It was about the experience,

217
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,136
about the story,

218
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
about the moment.

219
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,456
From the streets of the neighborhood,

220
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,100
the painting appears in fragments,

221
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:02,016
isolated from one another,

222
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,296
standing alone.

223
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,496
But connected with the sign of calligraphy

224
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,376
that today reveals the powerful message
that we should all think about

225
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
before we want to judge somebody.

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,776
Anyone who wants to see
the sunlight clearly

227
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
needs to wipe his eyes first.

228
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,176
Thank you.

229
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,961
(Applause)
