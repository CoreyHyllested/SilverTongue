00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:17,246
When I opened Mott Hall
Bridges Academy in 2010,

1
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:19,674
my goal was simple:

2
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,563
open a school to close a prison.

3
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,510
Now to some, this was an audacious goal,

4
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:31,161
because our school is located
in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --

5
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,973
one of the most underserved
and violent neighborhoods

6
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,063
in all of New York City.

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,673
Like many urban schools
with high poverty rates,

8
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:44,507
we face numerous challenges,

9
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:47,599
like finding teachers who can empathize

10
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:51,220
with the complexities
of a disadvantaged community,

11
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,651
lack of funding for technology,

12
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,615
low parental involvement

13
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:03,357
and neighborhood gangs that recruit
children as early as fourth grade.

14
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:06,292
So here I was,

15
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:13,142
the founding principal of a middle school
that was a district public school,

16
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,855
and I only had 45 kids to start.

17
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,540
Thirty percent of them had special needs.

18
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:24,838
Eighty-six percent of them
were below grade level

19
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:26,884
in English and in math.

20
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,971
And 100 percent were living
below the poverty level.

21
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:36,567
If our children are not in our classrooms,

22
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,937
how will they learn?

23
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,505
And if they're not learning,

24
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:42,231
where would they end up?

25
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:48,372
It was evident when I would
ask my 13-year-old,

26
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:49,657
"Young man,

27
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,018
where do you see yourself in five years?"

28
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,322
And his response:

29
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:57,912
"I don't know if I'm gonna
live that long."

30
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:01,847
Or to have a young woman say to me

31
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:08,232
that she had a lifelong goal
of working in a fast-food restaurant.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,969
To me, this was unacceptable.

33
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:15,099
It was also evident that they had no idea

34
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:17,268
that there was a landscape of opportunity

35
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:20,040
that existed beyond their neighborhood.

36
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:25,799
We call our students "scholars,"
because they're lifelong learners.

37
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,377
And the skills that they learn today

38
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,722
will prepare them for college
and career readiness.

39
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:37,072
I chose the royal colors
of purple and black,

40
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:42,560
because I want them to be reminded
that they are descendants of greatness,

41
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:44,409
and that through education,

42
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,480
they are future engineers,

43
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:47,666
scientists,

44
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,053
entrepreneurs

45
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:53,389
and even leaders who can and will
take over this world.

46
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:55,822
To date,

47
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:59,348
we have had three graduating classes,

48
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,345
at a 98 --

49
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:05,484
(Applause)

50
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,183
At a 98-percent graduation rate.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,953
This is nearly 200 children,

52
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:20,233
who are now going to some of the most
competitive high schools

53
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,731
in New York City.

54
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:27,319
(Applause)

55
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,186
It was a cold day in January

56
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:36,566
when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet,
met Brandon Stanton,

57
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:41,255
the founder of the popular blog
"Humans of New York."

58
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:45,995
Brandon shared the story
of a young man from Brownsville

59
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,739
who had witnessed violence firsthand,

60
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:53,502
by witnessing a man
being thrown off of a roof.

61
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:57,703
Yet he can still
be influenced by a principal

62
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:01,204
who had opened up a school
that believes in all children.

63
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,095
Vidal embodies the story of so many
of our underprivileged children

64
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:10,230
who are struggling to survive,

65
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,650
which is why we must
make education a priority.

66
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:19,204
Brandon's post created a global sensation

67
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,607
that touched the lives of millions.

68
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:26,810
This resulted in 1,4 million
dollars being raised

69
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,311
for our scholars to attend field trips
to colleges and universities,

70
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,279
Summer STEAM programs,

71
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,594
as well as college scholarships.

72
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:40,969
You need to understand

73
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:46,462
that when 200 young people
from Brownsville visited Harvard,

74
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,137
they now understood

75
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:53,431
that a college of their choice
was a real possibility.

76
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,895
And the impossibilities
that had been imposed upon them

77
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,561
by a disadvantaged community

78
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:04,122
were replaced by hope and purpose.

79
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:10,484
The revolution in education
is happening in our schools,

80
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:14,703
with adults who provide love,

81
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:15,903
structure,

82
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,089
support

83
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,363
and knowledge.

84
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,782
These are the things
that inspire children.

85
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,109
But it is not an easy task.

86
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,854
And there are high demands

87
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,953
within an education system
that is not perfect.

88
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:35,850
But I have a dynamic group of educators

89
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:41,026
who collaborate as a team to determine
what is the best curriculum.

90
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,423
They take time beyond their school day,

91
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,744
and come in on weekends

92
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:50,221
and even use their own money
to often provide resources

93
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,624
when we do not have it.

94
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,652
And as the principal,

95
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:58,562
I have to inspect what I expect.

96
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,157
So I show up in classes

97
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,922
and I conduct observations
to give feedback,

98
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:08,361
because I want my teachers
to be just as successful

99
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,700
as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

100
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,622
And I give them access to me
every single day,

101
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:18,510
which is why they all have
my personal cell number,

102
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,592
including my scholars
and those who graduated --

103
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,574
which is probably why I get
phone calls and text messages

104
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,362
at three o'clock in the morning.

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,571
(Laughter)

106
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:30,770
But we are all connected to succeed,

107
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:32,702
and good leaders do this.

108
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:37,546
Tomorrow's future is sitting
in our classrooms.

109
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:40,407
And they are our responsibility.

110
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,503
That means everyone in here,

111
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,657
and those who are watching the screen.

112
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,019
We must believe in their brilliance,

113
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,843
and remind them by teaching them

114
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:57,361
that there indeed is power in education.

115
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,227
Thank you.

116
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:09,379
(Applause)
