0
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,976
When I think about dreams,

1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,876
like many of you,

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,585
I think about this picture.

3
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:24,875
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,113
step off the Lunar Module
onto the surface of the Moon.

5
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,684
I had never seen anything like it before,

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,946
and I've never seen
anything like it since.

7
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,613
We got to the Moon for one simple reason:

8
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:43,943
John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

9
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,470
And in the absence of that deadline,

10
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,501
we would still be dreaming about it.

11
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:55,877
Leonard Bernstein said two things
are necessary for great achievement:

12
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,366
a plan and not quite enough time.

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,520
(Laughter)

14
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:08,345
Deadlines and commitments

15
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,382
are the great and fading
lessons of Apollo.

16
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:18,545
And they are what give the word
"moonshot" its meaning.

17
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:24,220
And our world is in desperate need
of political leaders

18
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:28,029
willing to set bold deadlines

19
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:31,981
for the achievement of daring dreams
on the scale of Apollo again.

20
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,861
When I think about dreams,

21
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:39,934
I think about the drag queens
of LA and Stonewall

22
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,307
and millions of other people
risking everything

23
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,643
to come out when that
was really dangerous,

24
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:49,388
and of this picture of the White House
lit up in rainbow colors,

25
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:50,570
yes --

26
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:56,373
(Applause) --

27
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:59,885
celebrating America's gay and lesbian
citizens' right to marry.

28
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,156
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams
I could never have imagined

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,908
when I was 18

30
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,932
and figuring out that I was gay

31
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:13,623
and feeling estranged from my country

32
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:16,043
and my dreams because of it.

33
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:21,210
I think about this picture of my family

34
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:25,257
that I never dreamed I could ever have --

35
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:31,117
(Applause) --

36
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,067
and of our children holding this headline

37
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:38,852
I never dreamed could ever be printed
about the Supreme Court ruling.

38
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:46,295
We need more of the courage
of drag queens and astronauts.

39
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,645
(Laughter)

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,342
(Applause)

41
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:54,708
But I want to talk
about the need for us to dream

42
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,818
in more than one dimension,

43
00:02:56,842 --> 00:03:02,248
because there was something about Apollo
that I didn't know when I was 8,

44
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,533
and something about organizing
that the rainbow colors over.

45
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,778
Of the 30 astronauts in the original
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,

46
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:16,310
only seven marriages survived.

47
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,474
Those iconic images of the astronauts
bouncing on the Moon

48
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:25,510
obscure the alcoholism
and depression on Earth.

49
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,517
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,

50
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,956
asked during the time of Apollo,

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,896
"What can we gain by sailing to the moon

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,427
if we are not able to cross the abyss
that separates us from ourselves?"

53
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:46,372
And what can we gain by the right to marry

54
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:49,539
if we are not able to cross the acrimony

55
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:54,089
and emotional distance
that so often separates us from our love?

56
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,581
And not just in marriage.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,024
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,

58
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:08,429
tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS

59
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:11,849
and breast cancer and non-profit activism,

60
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:13,437
all in the name of love.

61
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:19,615
Thomas Merton also wrote
about wars among saints

62
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,668
and that "there is a pervasive form
of contemporary violence

63
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:30,041
to which the idealist
most easily succumbs:

64
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,906
activism and overwork.

65
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:38,191
The frenzy of our activism
neutralizes our work for peace.

66
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:42,533
It destroys our own
inner capacity for peace."

67
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:49,502
Too often our dreams become
these compartmentalized fixations

68
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:51,359
on some future

69
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:55,502
that destroy our ability to be present
for our lives right now.

70
00:04:56,926 --> 00:05:00,641
Our dreams of a better life
for some future humanity

71
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,925
or some other humanity in another country

72
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,973
alienate us from the beautiful
human beings sitting next to us

73
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:08,910
at this very moment.

74
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,640
Well, that's just the price
of progress, we say.

75
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,077
You can go to the Moon

76
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:19,115
or you can have stability
in your family life.

77
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:23,988
And we can't conceive of dreaming
in both dimensions at the same time.

78
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:27,777
And we don't set the bar
much higher than stability

79
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,555
when it comes to our emotional life.

80
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,915
Which is why our technology
for talking to one another

81
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,308
has gone vertical,

82
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:40,038
our ability to listen
and understand one another

83
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,232
has gone nowhere.

84
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:46,220
Our access to information
is through the roof,

85
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:51,220
our access to joy, grounded.

86
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:59,314
But this idea, that our present
and our future are mutually exclusive,

87
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:03,334
that to fulfill our potential for doing
we have to surrender

88
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:06,521
our profound potential for being,

89
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:10,456
that the number of transistors
on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,

90
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,782
but our capacity for compassion
and humanity and serenity and love

91
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:16,884
is somehow limited

92
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,874
is a false and suffocating choice.

93
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,049
Now, I'm not suggesting

94
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:29,701
simply the uninspiring idea
of more work-life balance.

95
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,454
What good is it for me to spend
more time with my kids at home

96
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,263
if my mind is always somewhere else
while I'm doing it?

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,565
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.

98
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,961
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming
a tool for improving productivity.

99
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,290
(Laughter)

100
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:49,466
Right?

101
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,434
I'm talking about dreaming

102
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:57,219
as boldly in the dimension of our being

103
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,727
as we do about industry and technology.

104
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:03,615
I'm talking about
an audacious authenticity

105
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,528
that allows us to cry with one another,

106
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:13,826
a heroic humility that allows us
to remove our masks and be real.

107
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,375
It is our inability
to be with one another,

108
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,733
our fear of crying with one another,
that gives rise to so many

109
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:24,051
of the problems we are frantically
trying to solve in the first place,

110
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:27,375
from Congressional gridlock
to economic inhumanity.

111
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:31,364
(Applause)

112
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:35,435
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk
called an Epoch B,

113
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:41,070
a new epoch in which we become
as excited about and curious about

114
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,103
and scientific about
the development of our humanity

115
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,722
as we are about the development
of our technology.

116
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,802
We should not shrink from this opportunity

117
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,595
simply because
we don't really understand it.

118
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,972
There was a time
when we didn't understand space.

119
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:02,150
Or because we're more used
to technology and activism.

120
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,445
That is the very definition
of being stuck in a comfort zone.

121
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:11,103
We are now very comfortable imagining
unimaginable technological achievement.

122
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:15,993
In 2016, it is the dimension
of our being itself

123
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:21,147
that cries out for its fair share
of our imagination.

124
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,107
Now, we're all here to dream,

125
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,799
but maybe if we're honest about it,

126
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:30,512
each of us chasing our own dream.

127
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:34,306
You know, looking at the name tags
to see who can help me with my dream,

128
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,426
sometimes looking right through
one another's humanity.

129
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,156
I can't be bothered with you right now.
I have an idea for saving the world.

130
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:42,665
Right?

131
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,806
(Laughter)

132
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,306
Years ago, once upon a time,
I had this beautiful company

133
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,290
that created these long journeys
for heroic civic engagement.

134
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,694
And we had this mantra:

135
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:00,535
"Human. Kind. Be Both."

136
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:07,075
And we encouraged people to experiment
outrageously with kindness.

137
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,360
Like, "Go help everybody
set up their tents."

138
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,971
And there were a lot of tents.

139
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,265
(Laughter)

140
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,766
"Go buy everybody Popsicles."

141
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,671
"Go help people fix their flat tires

142
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:22,621
even though you know
the dinner line is going to get longer."

143
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,019
And people really took us up on this,

144
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,670
so much so that if you got
a flat tire on the AIDS ride,

145
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:31,321
you had trouble fixing it, because there
were so many people there asking you

146
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,495
if you needed help.

147
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:37,354
For a few days,
for tens of thousands of people,

148
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,292
we created these worlds

149
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:43,522
that everybody said were the way
they wish the world could always be.

150
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:50,823
What if we experimented
with creating that kind of world

151
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,485
these next few days?

152
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:57,965
And instead of going up to someone
and asking them, "What do you do?"

153
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,264
ask them, "So what are your dreams?"

154
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,283
or "What are your broken dreams?"

155
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:10,163
You know, "TED."
Tend to Each other's Dreams.

156
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,599
(Applause)

157
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:18,179
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"

158
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,869
or "I want to build
a tree house with my kid."

159
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:24,704
You know, instead of going up
to the person everybody wants to meet,

160
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,485
go up to the person who is all alone

161
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,196
and ask them if they want
to grab a cup of coffee.

162
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:33,020
I think what we fear most

163
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:37,400
is that we will be denied the opportunity
to fulfill our true potential,

164
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:40,035
that we are born to dream

165
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,671
and we might die
without ever having the chance.

166
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,258
Imagine living in a world

167
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:53,479
where we simply recognize
that deep, existential fear in one another

168
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:56,635
and love one another boldly
because we know

169
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,222
that to be human
is to live with that fear.

170
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:07,341
It's time for us to dream
in multiple dimensions simultaneously,

171
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:12,230
and somewhere that transcends
all of the wondrous things

172
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,904
we can and will and must do

173
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:22,087
lies the domain of all
the unbelievable things we could be.

174
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:27,206
It's time we set foot into that dimension

175
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,983
and came out about the fact
that we have dreams there, too.

176
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:36,079
If the Moon could dream,

177
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,952
I think that would be its dream for us.

178
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,179
It's an honor to be with you.

179
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,112
Thank you very much.

180
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:54,136
(Applause)
