00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:15,768
At Free America, we've done
a listening and learning tour.

1
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,834
We visited not only with prosecutors

2
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,604
but with legislators,

3
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:26,489
with inmates in our state
and local prisons.

4
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,932
We've gone to immigration
detention centers.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,675
We've met a lot of people.

6
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:39,398
And we've seen that redemption
and transformation can happen

7
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:44,109
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,

8
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:47,150
giving hope to those
who want to create a better life

9
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:48,842
after serving their time.

10
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,596
Imagine if we also considered
the front end of this prison pipeline.

11
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:55,905
What would it look like
if we intervened,

12
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,882
with rehabilitation as a core value --

13
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:01,940
with love and compassion as core values?

14
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:04,822
We would have a society that is safer,

15
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:05,997
healthier

16
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,870
and worthy of raising our children in.

17
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,536
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.

18
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:16,539
James served 12 years
in the San Quentin State Prison

19
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:19,213
and is being released in 18 months.

20
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,774
Now James, like you and me,

21
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:24,714
is more than the worst thing he's done.

22
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,608
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.

23
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,882
He committed a crime;

24
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,523
he's paying his debt,

25
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,011
and working hard to build the skills

26
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,122
to make the transition back
to a productive life

27
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:41,783
when he enters the civilian
population again.

28
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:44,461
Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,

29
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,520
is an example of what happens

30
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:50,995
if we believe that our failings
don't define who we are,

31
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,321
that we are all worthy of redemption

32
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:57,582
and if we support those impacted
by mass incarceration,

33
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,233
we can all heal together.

34
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,320
I'd like to introduce you
to James right now,

35
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:04,828
and he's going to share
his journey of redemption

36
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,002
through spoken word.

37
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,782
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.

38
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,721
TED, welcome to San Quentin.

39
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,195
The talent is abundant
behind prison walls.

40
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,640
Future software engineers,

41
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:18,943
entrepreneurs,

42
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,118
craftsmen,

43
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,293
musicians

44
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:22,600
and artists.

45
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,721
This piece is inspired
by all of the hard work

46
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,973
that men and women are doing on the inside

47
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:32,322
to create better lives
and futures for themselves

48
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,179
after they serve their time.

49
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,518
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."

50
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:43,852
I live in a world where most people
are too afraid to go.

51
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,777
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,

52
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,952
steel bars,

53
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,270
where razor wire have a way

54
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,380
of cutting away at the hopes
for a brighter tomorrow.

55
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:54,848
I live in a world

56
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,405
that kill people who kill people

57
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:57,580
in order to teach people

58
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,000
that killing people is wrong.

59
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,577
Imagine that.

60
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,262
Better yet,

61
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:06,356
imagine a world where healed people
helped hurt people heal

62
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,633
and become strong.

63
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:11,618
Maybe then we would all
be singin' "Redemption Song."

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,989
I live in a world that
has been called "hell on Earth"

65
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,723
by those trapped inside.

66
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,969
But I've come to the stark realization

67
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,197
that prison --

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,316
it really is what you make it.

69
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,907
You see, in spite
of the harshness of my reality,

70
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,391
there is a silver lining.

71
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,288
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,

72
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,701
it was just a matter of time.

73
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,117
And so I treated my first steps
as if they were my last mile,

74
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:40,098
and I realized that you
don't have to be free

75
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:41,791
in order to experience freedom.

76
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,649
And just because you're free,

77
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:46,470
doesn't mean that you have freedom.

78
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:50,242
Many of us, for years,
have been battling our inner demons.

79
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:53,607
We walk around smiling
when inside we're really screamin':

80
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,781
freedom!

81
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,321
Don't you get it?

82
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,503
We're all serving time;

83
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,099
we're just in different places.

84
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,931
As for me,

85
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:05,535
I choose to be free
from the prisons I've created.

86
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,710
The key:

87
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:07,885
forgiveness.

88
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,060
Action's my witness.

89
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,234
If we want freedom,

90
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,669
then we gotta think different.

91
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,840
Because freedom ...

92
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,377
it isn't a place.

93
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:20,933
It's a mind setting.

94
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,147
Thank you.

95
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,512
(Applause)

96
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:34,536
(Piano)

97
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,710
John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.

98
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,987
Sold I to the merchant ships.

99
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:59,598
Minutes after they took I

100
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,589
from the bottomless pit.

101
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,977
My hands were made strong

102
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:11,207
by the hand of the almighty.

103
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,371
We forward in this generation

104
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,844
triumphantly.

105
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:24,851
Won't you help to sing

106
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:29,401
these songs of freedom?

107
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,754
'Cause all I ever had --

108
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,603
redemption songs.

109
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,153
Redemption songs.

110
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:48,253
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

111
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,848
None but ourselves can free our minds.

112
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,447
Have no fear for atomic energy

113
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,566
'cause none of them can stop the time.

114
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:04,609
How long shall they kill our prophets

115
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,395
while we stand aside and look?

116
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,677
Some say it's just a part of it,

117
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:16,971
we've got to fulfill the book.

118
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:22,226
Won't you help to sing

119
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,468
these songs of freedom?

120
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,183
'Cause all I ever had --

121
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:34,671
redemption songs.

122
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,752
Redemption songs.

123
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:45,776
(Piano)

124
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,735
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

125
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:04,113
None but ourselves can free our minds.

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,404
Have no fear for atomic energy

127
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,281
'cause none of them can stop the time.

128
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,440
How long shall they kill our prophets

129
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,154
while we stand aside and look?

130
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:24,746
Some say it's just a part of it,

131
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,317
we've got to fulfill the book.

132
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:33,397
Won't you help to sing

133
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,634
these songs of freedom?

134
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:41,354
'Cause all I ever had --

135
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:46,167
redemption songs.

136
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:50,238
Redemption songs.

137
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,412
These songs of freedom.

138
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:59,666
'Cause all I ever had --

139
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,215
redemption songs.

140
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,663
Redemption songs.

141
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:16,695
Redemption songs.

142
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,451
(Piano)

143
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:26,057
(Applause)

144
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,231
Thank you.

145
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:28,736
Thank you.

146
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,667
(Applause)
