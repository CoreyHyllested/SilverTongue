00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,087
How do you find a dinosaur?

1
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,753
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

2
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,945
It's not.

3
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:24,195
And the answer relies on a formula
that all paleontologists use.

4
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:26,674
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,290
First, find rocks of the right age.

6
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:35,320
Second, those rocks
must be sedimentary rocks.

7
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:40,303
And third, layers of those rocks
must be naturally exposed.

8
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:41,919
That's it.

9
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:45,354
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,783
chances are good
that you will find fossils.

11
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,403
Now let me break down this formula.

12
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:55,183
Organisms exist only during certain
geological intervals.

13
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,637
So you have to find
rocks of the right age,

14
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,829
depending on what your interests are.

15
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,363
If you want to find trilobites,

16
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:04,538
you have to find the really,
really old rocks of the Paleozoic --

17
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:07,867
rocks between a half a billion
and a quarter-billion years old.

18
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:10,394
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,

19
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:12,775
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,280
They hadn't evolved yet.

21
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,391
You have to find the younger
rocks of the Mesozoic,

22
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:18,812
and in the case of dinosaurs,

23
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,561
between 235 and 66 million years ago.

24
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,670
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
of the right age at this point,

25
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:29,826
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,180
geologically mapped.

27
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:33,761
This is hard-won information.

28
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:37,127
The annals of Earth history
are written in rocks,

29
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:38,452
one chapter upon the next,

30
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,080
such that the oldest pages are on bottom

31
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:42,758
and the youngest on top.

32
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:47,636
Now, were it quite that easy,
geologists would rejoice.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,918
It's not.

34
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,996
The library of Earth is an old one.

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,659
It has no librarian to impose order.

36
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:57,241
Operating over vast swaths of time,

37
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:01,398
myriad geological processes
offer every possible insult

38
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:03,505
to the rocks of ages.

39
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:06,946
Most pages are destroyed
soon after being written.

40
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,162
Some pages are overwritten,

41
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:13,756
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
of long-gone landscapes.

42
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,525
Pages that do find sanctuary
under the advancing sands of time

43
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,768
are never truly safe.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,754
Unlike the Moon --
our dead, rocky companion --

45
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,418
the Earth is alive, pulsing
with creative and destructive forces

46
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,893
that power its geological metabolism.

47
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:34,237
Lunar rocks brought back
by the Apollo astronauts

48
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:37,228
all date back to about the age
of the Solar System.

49
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,849
Moon rocks are forever.

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,086
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.

51
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,694
All will suffer ruination,

52
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:49,544
through some combination
of mutilation, compression,

53
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,074
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,192
Thus, the volumes of Earth history
are incomplete and disheveled.

55
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,694
The library is vast and magnificent --

56
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:05,258
but decrepit.

57
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:09,139
And it was this tattered complexity
in the rock record

58
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:12,194
that obscured its meaning
until relatively recently.

59
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,357
Nature provided no card catalog
for geologists --

60
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:17,094
this would have to be invented.

61
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,710
Five thousand years after the Sumerians
learned to record their thoughts

62
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,886
on clay tablets,

63
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,993
the Earth's volumes remained
inscrutable to humans.

64
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:28,959
We were geologically illiterate,

65
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:32,819
unaware of the antiquity
of our own planet

66
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,352
and ignorant of our connection

67
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,573
to deep time.

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,216
It wasn't until the turn
of the 19th century

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,636
that our blinders were removed,

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,054
first, with the publication
of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"

71
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:50,950
in which he told us that the Earth
reveals no vestige of a beginning

72
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,752
and no prospect of an end;

73
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:57,491
and then, with the printing
of William Smith's map of Britain,

74
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,700
the first country-scale geological map,

75
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,090
giving us for the first time

76
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:05,042
predictive insight into where
certain types of rocks might occur.

77
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,527
After that, you could say things like,

78
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:10,554
"If we go over there,
we should be in the Jurassic,"

79
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:14,329
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."

80
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,984
So now, if you want to find trilobites,

81
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,137
get yourself a good geological map

82
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:22,412
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.

83
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:25,342
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,

84
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,420
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.

85
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,316
Now of course, you can only make
a fossil in a sedimentary rock,

86
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,989
a rock made by sand and mud.

87
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,656
You can't have a fossil

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,004
in an igneous rock formed
by magma, like a granite,

89
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,090
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.

90
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,908
And you have to get yourself in a desert.

91
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:48,459
It's not that dinosaurs
particularly lived in deserts;

92
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:50,047
they lived on every land mass

93
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,128
and in every imaginable environment.

94
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:55,541
It's that you need to go to a place
that's a desert today,

95
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:58,739
a place that doesn't have
too many plants covering up the rocks,

96
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:02,643
and a place where erosion is always
exposing new bones at the surface.

97
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,835
So find those three things:

98
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,414
rocks of the right age,

99
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,487
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,

100
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,068
and get yourself on the ground,

101
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,604
and you literally walk

102
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,216
until you see a bone
sticking out of the rock.

103
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:19,664
Here's a picture that I took
in Southern Patagonia.

104
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:23,109
Every pebble that you see
on the ground there

105
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,656
is a piece of dinosaur bone.

106
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,344
So when you're in that right situation,

107
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,122
it's not a question of whether
you'll find fossils or not;

108
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,535
you're going to find fossils.

109
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:35,607
The question is: Will you find something
that is scientifically significant?

110
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:39,601
And to help with that, I'm going to add
a fourth part to our formula,

111
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,802
which is this:

112
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:44,891
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.

113
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:46,886
(Laughter)

114
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,265
It's not that I don't like
other paleontologists.

115
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,814
When you go to a place
that's relatively unexplored,

116
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:54,652
you have a much better chance
of not only finding fossils

117
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:57,185
but of finding something
that's new to science.

118
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,899
So that's my formula
for finding dinosaurs,

119
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,956
and I've applied it all around the world.

120
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,308
In the austral summer of 2004,

121
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:06,157
I went to the bottom of South America,

122
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,298
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,

123
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,575
to prospect for dinosaurs:

124
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,972
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,

125
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,199
in a desert,

126
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:18,485
a place that had been barely visited
by paleontologists.

127
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,469
And we found this.

128
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,319
This is a femur, a thigh bone,

129
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,712
of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.

130
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,570
That bone is 2,2 meters across.

131
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,683
That's over seven feet long.

132
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,907
Now, unfortunately,
that bone was isolated.

133
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,970
We dug and dug and dug,
and there wasn't another bone around.

134
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,689
But it made us hungry to go back
the next year for more.

135
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,316
And on the first day
of that next field season,

136
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,709
I found this: another two-meter femur,

137
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,376
only this time not isolated,

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,495
this time associated with 145 other bones

139
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,319
of a giant plant eater.

140
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:57,160
And after three more hard,
really brutal field seasons,

141
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,136
the quarry came to look like this.

142
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:03,715
And there you see the tail
of that great beast wrapping around me.

143
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,291
The giant that lay in this grave,
the new species of dinosaur,

144
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:11,013
we would eventually call
"Dreadnoughtus schrani."

145
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:14,509
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
from snout to tail.

146
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,708
It stood two-and-a-half stories
at the shoulder,

147
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:22,401
and all fleshed out in life,
it weighed 65 tons.

148
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,872
People ask me sometimes,
"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"

149
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:29,680
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.

150
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,709
Now, one of the really cool things
about being a paleontologist

151
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,502
is when you find a new species,
you get to name it.

152
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:40,360
And I've always thought it a shame
that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs

153
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:44,863
are too often portrayed as passive,
lumbering platters of meat

154
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,132
on the landscape.

155
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,282
(Laughter)

156
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,884
They're not.

157
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:51,927
Big herbivores can be surly,
and they can be territorial --

158
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,474
you do not want to mess with a hippo
or a rhino or a water buffalo.

159
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:01,822
The bison in Yellowstone injure
far more people than do the grizzly bears.

160
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:06,987
So can you imagine a big bull,
65-ton Dreadnoughtus

161
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,714
in the breeding season,

162
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,238
defending a territory?

163
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,310
That animal would have been
incredibly dangerous,

164
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:18,055
a menace to all around, and itself
would have had nothing to fear.

165
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,732
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"

166
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,457
or, "fears nothing."

167
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:25,213
Now, to grow so large,

168
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,849
an animal like Dreadnoughtus
would've had to have been

169
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,030
a model of efficiency.

170
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:32,817
That long neck and long tail help it
radiate heat into the environment,

171
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,379
passively controlling its temperature.

172
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:38,908
And that long neck also serves
as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.

173
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:41,712
Dreadnoughtus could stand
in one place and with that neck

174
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,028
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,

175
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:47,966
taking in tens of thousands of calories
while expending very few.

176
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,921
And these animals evolved
a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,

177
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,760
giving them immense stability,

178
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,701
because when you're 65 tons,
when you're literally as big as a house,

179
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:01,832
the penalty for falling over

180
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:03,013
is death.

181
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,582
Yeah, these animals are big and tough,

182
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,383
but they won't take a blow like that.

183
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,988
Dreadnoughtus falls over,
ribs break and pierce lungs.

184
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,537
Organs burst.

185
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,347
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,

186
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,948
you don't get to fall down
in life -- even once.

187
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:21,230
Now, after this particular
Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried

188
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:25,974
and de-fleshed by a multitude
of bacteria, worms and insects,

189
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,163
its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,

190
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,203
exchanging molecules with the groundwater

191
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,845
and becoming more and more
like the entombing rock.

192
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,979
As layer upon layer
of sediment accumulated,

193
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:38,829
pressure from all sides
weighed in like a stony glove

194
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:44,478
whose firm and enduring grip held
each bone in a stabilizing embrace.

195
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:47,304
And then came the long ...

196
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,273
nothing.

197
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:53,186
Epoch after epoch of sameness,

198
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,154
nonevents without number.

199
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,923
All the while, the skeleton lay
everlasting and unchanging

200
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:01,310
in perfect equilibrium

201
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,047
within its rocky grave.

202
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,012
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.

203
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,683
The dinosaurs would reign
for another 12 million years

204
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,971
before their hegemony was snuffed out
in a fiery apocalypse.

205
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:16,220
The continents drifted. The mammals rose.

206
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:17,615
The Ice Age came.

207
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,870
And then, in East Africa,

208
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:26,506
an unpromising species of ape
evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.

209
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,204
These brainy primates were not
particularly fast or strong.

210
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,268
But they excelled at covering ground,

211
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,161
and in a remarkable diaspora

212
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:39,327
surpassing even the dinosaurs' record
of territorial conquest,

213
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:41,281
they dispersed across the planet,

214
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:44,485
ravishing every ecosystem
they encountered,

215
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,690
along the way, inventing culture
and metalworking and painting

216
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,056
and dance and music

217
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,000
and science

218
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:56,322
and rocket ships that would eventually
take 12 particularly excellent apes

219
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:58,197
to the surface of the Moon.

220
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,539
With seven billion peripatetic
Homo sapiens on the planet,

221
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,470
it was perhaps inevitable

222
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:10,532
that one of them would eventually
trod on the grave of the magnificent titan

223
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:13,508
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.

224
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,865
I was that ape.

225
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:19,981
And standing there, alone in the desert,

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,791
it was not lost on me

227
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,445
that the chance of any one individual
entering the fossil record

228
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:27,142
is vanishingly small.

229
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,087
But the Earth is very, very old.

230
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:34,371
And over vast tracts of time,
the improbable becomes the probable.

231
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,086
That's the magic of the geological record.

232
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,292
Thus, multitudinous creatures
living and dying on an old planet

233
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,243
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,

234
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,909
each one a small miracle,

235
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:47,224
but collectively, inevitable.

236
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,445
Sixty-six million years ago,
an asteroid hits the Earth

237
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:53,636
and wipes out the dinosaurs.

238
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:56,699
This easily might not have been.

239
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:00,167
But we only get one history,
and it's the one that we have.

240
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,467
But this particular reality
was not inevitable.

241
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:05,293
The tiniest perturbation
of that asteroid far from Earth

242
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:08,318
would have caused it to miss
our planet by a wide margin.

243
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,107
The pivotal, calamitous day during which
the dinosaurs were wiped out,

244
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,342
setting the stage
for the modern world as we know it

245
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,898
didn't have to be.

246
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:18,887
It could've just been another day --

247
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,784
a Thursday, perhaps --

248
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:26,783
among the 63 billion days
already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.

249
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,698
But over geological time,

250
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:31,607
improbable, nearly impossible events

251
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,782
do occur.

252
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,729
Along the path from our wormy,
Cambrian ancestors

253
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:38,156
to primates dressed in suits,

254
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,061
innumerable forks in the road
led us to this very particular reality.

255
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:48,074
The bones of Dreadnoughtus
lay underground for 77 million years.

256
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,070
Who could have imagined

257
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:53,058
that a single species of shrew-like mammal

258
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,126
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world

259
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,202
would evolve into sentient beings

260
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:59,582
capable of characterizing
and understanding

261
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,613
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?

262
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,798
I once stood at the head
of the Missouri River

263
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,488
and bestraddled it.

264
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,325
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water

265
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:17,960
that issues forth from beneath a rock
in a boulder in a pasture,

266
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,681
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.

267
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,557
The stream next to it
runs a few hundred yards

268
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,859
and ends in a small pond.

269
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,867
Those two streams -- they look identical.

270
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:32,271
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,

271
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,564
and the other is the Missouri River.

272
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,164
Now go down to the mouth
of the Missouri, near St. Louis,

273
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:41,905
and it's pretty obvious
that that river is a big deal.

274
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,354
But go up into the Bitterroots
and look at the Missouri,

275
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:49,848
and human prospection does not
allow us to see it as anything special.

276
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,984
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period

277
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,453
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.

278
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,914
You would never guess

279
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:59,015
that they would amount
to anything special,

280
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,687
and they probably wouldn't have,

281
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,948
were it not for that pesky asteroid.

282
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:07,158
Now, make a thousand more worlds
and a thousand more solar systems

283
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:08,468
and let them run.

284
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,201
You will never get the same result.

285
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,630
No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,

286
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,962
but they would not be our world
and they would not have our history.

287
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,965
There are an infinite number of histories
that we could've had.

288
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,515
We only get one, and wow,
did we ever get a good one.

289
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:26,377
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.

290
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:30,423
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.

291
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:35,312
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
and pill bugs the length of a car

292
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,899
really existed.

293
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,795
Why study the ancient past?

294
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:44,319
Because it gives us perspective

295
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:46,319
and humility.

296
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:50,409
The dinosaurs died in the world's
fifth mass extinction,

297
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,201
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.

298
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:58,573
They didn't see it coming,
and they didn't have a choice.

299
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,475
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

300
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:07,934
And the nature of the fossil record
tells us that our place on this planet

301
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,757
is both precarious
and potentially fleeting.

302
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,895
Right now, our species is propagating
an environmental disaster

303
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,502
of geological proportions
that is so broad and so severe,

304
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,151
it can rightly be called
the sixth extinction.

305
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,245
Only unlike the dinosaurs,

306
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:26,619
we can see it coming.

307
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,111
And unlike the dinosaurs,

308
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,444
we can do something about it.

309
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,815
That choice is ours.

310
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,641
Thank you.

311
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:48,763
(Applause)
