0
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:14,276
Well, you know, sometimes

1
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:17,258
the most important things come
in the smallest packages.

2
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:20,847
I am going to try to convince you,
in the 15 minutes I have,

3
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:25,100
that microbes have a lot to say
about questions such as,

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,998
"Are we alone?"

5
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:32,223
and they can tell us more about
not only life in our solar system

6
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,100
but also maybe beyond,

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,397
and this is why I am tracking them down
in the most impossible places on Earth,

8
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:41,766
in extreme environments where conditions

9
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,450
are really pushing them
to the brink of survival.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,704
Actually, sometimes me too,
when I'm trying to follow them too close.

11
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:49,521
But here's the thing:

12
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:55,134
We are the only advanced civilization
in the solar system,

13
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:58,878
but that doesn't mean that there is
no microbial life nearby.

14
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,663
In fact, the planets
and moons you see here

15
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,633
could host life -- all of them --
and we know that,

16
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,482
and it's a strong possibility.

17
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:14,135
And if we were going to find life
on those moons and planets,

18
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:17,151
then we would answer questions such as,

19
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,287
are we alone in the solar system?

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,256
Where are we coming from?

21
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:24,233
Do we have family in the neighborhood?

22
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:28,157
Is there life beyond our solar system?

23
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:32,244
And we can ask all those questions
because there has been a revolution

24
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:36,520
in our understanding
of what a habitable planet is,

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,860
and today, a habitable planet is a planet

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,193
that has a zone where
water can stay stable,

27
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:47,922
but to me this is a horizontal
definition of habitability,

28
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,197
because it involves a distance to a star,

29
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:53,169
but there is another
dimension to habitability,

30
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,350
and this is a vertical dimension.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,527
Think of it as

32
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:06,210
conditions in the subsurface of a planet
where you are very far away from a sun,

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,353
but you still have water,
energy, nutrients,

34
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,304
which for some of them means food,

35
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,207
and a protection.

36
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,251
And when you look at the Earth,

37
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:19,796
very far away from any sunlight,
deep in the ocean,

38
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,665
you have life thriving

39
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:25,676
and it uses only chemistry
for life processes.

40
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:31,326
So when you think of it
at that point, all walls collapse.

41
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:33,600
You have no limitations, basically.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160
And if you have been looking
at the headlines lately,

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,120
then you will see that we have
discovered a subsurface ocean

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,989
on Europa, on Ganymede,
on Enceladus, on Titan,

45
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,923
and now we are finding a geyser
and hot springs on Enceladus,

46
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,978
Our solar system is turning
into a giant spa.

47
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:53,864
For anybody who has gone to a spa
knows how much microbes like that, right?

48
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,582
(Laughter)

49
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:59,111
So at that point, think also about Mars.

50
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:02,478
There is no life possible
at the surface of Mars today,

51
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,729
but it might still be hiding underground.

52
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:11,339
So, we have been making progress
in our understanding of habitability,

53
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,111
but we also have been making progress
in our understanding

54
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,687
of what the signatures
of life are on Earth.

55
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,543
And you can have what we call
organic molecules,

56
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,470
and these are the bricks of life,

57
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,350
and you can have fossils,

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,253
and you can minerals, biominerals,

59
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,643
which is due to the reaction
between bacteria and rocks,

60
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,777
and of course you can have
gases in the atmosphere.

61
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,983
And when you look at those
tiny green algae

62
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,934
on the right of the slide here,

63
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:41,450
they are the direct descendants
of those who have been pumping oxygen

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,843
a billion years ago
in the atmosphere of the Earth.

65
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:46,465
When they did that, they poisoned
90 percent of the life

66
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:47,987
at the surface of the Earth,

67
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:51,190
but they are the reason why
you are breathing this air today.

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,925
But as much as our understanding grows
of all of these things,

69
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:00,851
there is one question
we still cannot answer,

70
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:03,126
and this is, where are we coming from?

71
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,844
And you know, it's getting worse,

72
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,886
because we won't be able
to find the physical evidence

73
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,440
of where we are coming from
on this planet,

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,130
and the reason being is that anything that
is older than four billion years is gone.

75
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,754
All record is gone,

76
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:21,632
erased by plate tectonics and erosion.

77
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:25,184
This is what I call the Earth's
biological horizon.

78
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:28,667
Beyond this horizon we don't know
where we are coming from.

79
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,593
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.

80
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:35,308
And we might be able to find
evidence of our own origin

81
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,419
in the most unlikely place,
and this place in Mars.

82
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,420
How is this possible?

83
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,201
Well clearly at the beginning
of the solar system,

84
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,169
Mars and the Earth were bombarded
by giant asteroids and comets,

85
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,327
and there were ejecta
from these impacts all over the place.

86
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:56,187
Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks
at each other for a very long time.

87
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,230
Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.

88
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,181
Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.

89
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:05,359
So clearly, those two planets may have
been seeded by the same material.

90
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:09,283
So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting
there on the surface and waiting for us.

91
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:18,190
But that also means that we can go to Mars
and try to find traces of our own origin.

92
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,442
Mars may hold that secret for us.

93
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:23,150
This is why Mars is so special to us.

94
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,160
But for that to happen,

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,544
Mars needed to be habitable
at the time when conditions were right.

96
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,400
So was Mars habitable?

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,254
We have a number of missions
telling us exactly the same thing today.

98
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:39,992
At the time when life
appeared on the Earth,

99
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:44,830
Mars did have an ocean,
it had volcanoes, it had lakes,

100
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,673
and it had deltas like the beautiful
picture you see here.

101
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:51,460
This picture was sent by the Curiosity
rover only a few weeks ago.

102
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,142
It shows the remnants of a delta,
and this picture tells us something:

103
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:57,096
water was abundant

104
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,757
and stayed founting at the surface
for a very long time.

105
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:01,568
This is good news for life.

106
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,990
Life chemistry takes a long time
to actually happen.

107
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,507
So this is extremely good news,

108
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:10,127
but does that mean that if we go there,
life will be easy to find on Mars?

109
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,010
Not necessarily.

110
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,861
Here's what happened:

111
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:17,230
At the time when life exploded
at the surface of the Earth,

112
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,369
then everything went south for Mars,

113
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,901
literally.

114
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,472
The atmosphere was
stripped away by solar winds,

115
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,775
Mars lost its magnetosphere,

116
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:31,187
and then cosmic rays and U.V.
bombarded the surface

117
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:35,410
and water escaped to space
and went underground.

118
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,501
So if we want to be able to understand,

119
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:43,430
if we want to be able to find those traces
of the signatures of life

120
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,644
at the surface of Mars, if they are there,

121
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:48,831
we need to understand what was
the impact of each of these events

122
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,484
on the preservation of its record.

123
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:57,314
Only then will we be able
to know where those signatures are hiding,

124
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:00,997
and only then will we be able
to send our rover to the right places

125
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:04,146
where we can sample those rocks
that may be telling us something

126
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,862
really important about who we are,

127
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:10,972
or, if not, maybe telling us
that somewhere, independently,

128
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,828
life has appeared on another planet.

129
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,336
So to do that, it's easy.

130
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,894
You only need to go back
3,5 billion years ago

131
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,285
in the past of a planet.

132
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,909
We just need a time machine.

133
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,103
Easy, right?

134
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,673
Well, actually, it is.

135
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:30,574
Look around you -- that's planet Earth.

136
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,618
This is our time machine.

137
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,788
Geologists are using it
to go back in the past of our own planet.

138
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,971
I am using it a little bit differently.

139
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:41,966
I use planet Earth to go
in very extreme environments

140
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,868
where conditions were similar
to those of Mars

141
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,865
at the time when the climate changed,

142
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,745
and there I'm trying
to understand what happened.

143
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,439
What are the signatures of life?

144
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,272
What is left? How are we going to find it?

145
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:57,276
So for one moment now
I'm going to take you with me

146
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,130
on a trip into that time machine.

147
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,865
And now, what you see here,
we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,

148
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:11,594
but in fact we are less than a billion
years after the Earth and Mars formed.

149
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,285
The Earth and Mars will have looked
pretty much exactly like that --

150
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:18,796
volcanoes everywhere,
evaporating lakes everywhere,

151
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:22,103
minerals, hot springs,

152
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:25,934
and then you see those mounds
on the shore of those lakes?

153
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:29,394
Those are built by the descendants
of the first organisms

154
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:32,496
that gave us the first fossil on Earth.

155
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:36,555
But if we want to understand what's
going on, we need to go a little further.

156
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,470
And the other thing about those sites

157
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,946
is that exactly like on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

158
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:46,463
the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.

159
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:49,678
But we need to go back to that time
when everything changed on Mars,

160
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,761
and to do that, we need to go higher.

161
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:53,858
Why is that?

162
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,215
Because when you go higher,

163
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,337
the atmosphere is getting thinner,
it's getting more unstable,

164
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:03,648
the temperature is getting cooler,
and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.

165
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,457
Basically,

166
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:09,191
you are getting to those conditions
on Mars when everything changed.

167
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,837
So I was not promising anything about
a leisurely trip on the time machine.

168
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:19,371
You are not going to be sitting
in that time machine.

169
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:22,399
You have to haul 1,000 pounds
of equipment to the summit

170
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,184
of this 20,000-foot volcano
in the Andes here.

171
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:28,784
That's about 6,000 meters.

172
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:32,407
And you also have to sleep
on 42-degree slopes

173
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,518
and really hope that there won't
be any earthquake that night.

174
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:40,464
But when we get to the summit,
we actually find the lake we came for.

175
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:45,126
At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions

176
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,245
as those on Mars
three and a half billion years ago.

177
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:51,170
And now we have to change our voyage

178
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,890
into an inner voyage inside that lake,

179
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,541
and to do that, we have to remove
our mountain gear

180
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,847
and actually don suits and go for it.

181
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:06,452
But at the time we enter that lake,
at the very moment we enter that lake,

182
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,380
we are stepping back

183
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,561
three and a half billion years
in the past of another planet,

184
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:15,661
and then we are going to get
the answer came for.

185
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:19,633
Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.

186
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:22,953
Everything you see in this picture
is a living organism.

187
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:26,446
Maybe not so the diver,
but everything else.

188
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,853
But this picture is very deceiving.

189
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:33,523
Life is abundant in those lakes,

190
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:37,630
but like in many places on Earth
right now and due to climate change,

191
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,324
there is a huge loss in biodiversity.

192
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:43,740
In the samples that we took back home,

193
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,556
36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes
were composed of three species,

194
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:53,375
and those three species are the ones
that have survived so far.

195
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,162
Here's another lake,
right next to the first one.

196
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:59,830
The red color you see here
is not due to minerals.

197
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,151
It's actually due to the presence
of a tiny algae.

198
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:07,660
In this region, the U.V. radiation
is really nasty.

199
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,129
Anywhere on Earth, 11
is considered to be extreme.

200
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,160
During U.V. storms there,
the U.V. Index reaches 43.

201
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,976
SPF 30 is not going to do anything
to you over there,

202
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:23,342
and the water is so
transparent in those lakes

203
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:26,675
that the algae has
nowhere to hide, really,

204
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,965
and so they are developing
their own sunscreen,

205
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,749
and this is the red color you see.

206
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,310
But they can adapt only so far,

207
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,788
and then when all the water
is gone from the surface,

208
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:38,388
microbes have only one solution left:

209
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,246
They go underground.

210
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:43,171
And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,

211
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:46,391
well, they are actually
living inside rocks

212
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,585
and they are using the protection
of the translucence of the rocks

213
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,382
to get the good part of the U.V.

214
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:55,126
and discard the part that could
actually damage their DNA.

215
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,401
And this is why we are taking our rover

216
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,977
to train them to search
for life on Mars in these areas,

217
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:04,714
because if there was life on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

218
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:09,074
it had to use the same strategy
to actually protect itself.

219
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:12,242
Now, it is pretty obvious

220
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:15,770
that going to extreme environments
is helping us very much

221
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,761
for the exploration of Mars
and to prepare missions.

222
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:24,100
So far, it has helped us to understand
the geology of Mars.

223
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,221
It has helped to understand the past
climate of Mars and its evolution,

224
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:31,208
but also its habitability potential.

225
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:36,747
Our most recent rover on Mars
has discovered traces of organics.

226
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:39,706
Yeah, there are organics
at the surface of Mars.

227
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:43,607
And it also discovered traces of methane.

228
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:46,152
And we don't know yet
if the methane in question

229
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,990
is really from geology or biology.

230
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,859
Regardless, what we know is
that because of the discovery,

231
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:58,100
the hypothesis that there is still
life present on Mars today

232
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,455
remains a viable one.

233
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:05,652
So by now, I think I have convinced you
that Mars is very special to us,

234
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,628
but it would be a mistake to think
that Mars is the only place

235
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:13,574
in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.

236
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:18,352
And the reason is because
Mars and the Earth

237
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:21,143
could have a common root
to their tree of life,

238
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:25,290
but when you go beyond Mars,
it's not that easy.

239
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,900
Celestial mechanics
is not making it so easy

240
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,315
for an exchange
of material between planets,

241
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:34,355
and so if we were to discover
life on those planets,

242
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,212
it would be different from us.

243
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:38,050
It would be a different type of life.

244
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,903
But in the end, it might be just us,

245
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,899
it might be us and Mars,

246
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,382
or it can be many trees of life
in the solar system.

247
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:50,110
I don't know the answer yet,
but I can tell you something:

248
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,542
No matter what the result is,
no matter what that magic number is,

249
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,553
it is going to give us a standard

250
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:01,081
by which we are going to be able
to measure the life potential,

251
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:04,191
abundance and diversity
beyond our own solar system.

252
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,751
And this can be achieved
by our generation.

253
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:10,614
This can be our legacy,
but only if we dare to explore.

254
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:13,740
Now, finally,

255
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,708
if somebody tells you that looking
for alien microbes is not cool

256
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,138
because you cannot have
a philosophical conversation with them,

257
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:27,014
let me show you why and how
you can tell them they're wrong.

258
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:30,572
Well, organic material
is going to tell you

259
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:36,231
about environment, about complexity
and about diversity.

260
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:42,350
DNA, or any information carrier,
is going to tell you about adaptation,

261
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,371
about evolution, about survival,
about planetary changes

262
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:50,219
and about the transfer of information.

263
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:53,307
All together, they are telling us

264
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:57,208
what started as a microbial pathway,

265
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,226
and why what started
as a microbial pathway

266
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:03,686
sometimes ends up as a civilization

267
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:07,308
or sometimes ends up as a dead end.

268
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,724
Look at the solar system,
and look at the Earth.

269
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:13,531
On Earth, there are many
intelligent species,

270
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:16,898
but only one has achieved technology.

271
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:20,195
Right here in the journey
of our own solar system,

272
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,934
there is a very, very powerful message

273
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:28,320
that says here's how we should look
for alien life, small and big.

274
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,618
So yeah, microbes are talking
and we are listening,

275
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,337
and they are taking us,

276
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,891
one planet at a time
and one moon at a time,

277
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,770
towards their big brothers out there.

278
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,486
And they are telling us about diversity,

279
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:44,110
they are telling us about
abundance of life,

280
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,150
and they are telling us
how this life has survived thus far

281
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,192
to reach civilization,

282
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:56,174
intelligence, technology
and, indeed, philosophy.

283
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,879
Thank you.

284
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,115
(Applause)
