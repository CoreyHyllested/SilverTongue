00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,256
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence,

1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,976
and it is my job,
my responsibility, as an astronomer

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,320
to remind people that alien hypotheses
should always be a last resort.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,576
Now, I want to tell you
a story about that.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,176
It involves data from a NASA mission,

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,160
ordinary people and one of the most
extraordinary stars in our galaxy.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,400
It began in 2009 with the launch
of NASA's Kepler mission.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,056
Kepler's main scientific objective

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,056
was to find planets
outside of our solar system.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,656
It did this by staring
at a single field in the sky,

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,520
this one, with all the tiny boxes.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,896
And in this one field,

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,336
it monitored the brightness
of over 150,000 stars

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,776
continuously for four years,

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,440
taking a data point every 30 minutes.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,496
It was looking for what
astronomers call a transit.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,536
This is when the planet's orbit
is aligned in our line of sight,

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,696
just so that the planet
crosses in front of a star.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,096
And when this happens,
it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,840
which you can see as a dip in this curve.

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,016
And so the team at NASA
had developed very sophisticated computers

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,760
to search for transits
in all the Kepler data.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,056
At the same time
of the first data release,

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,200
astronomers at Yale
were wondering an interesting thing:

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
What if computers missed something?

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,720
And so we launched the citizen
science project called Planet Hunters

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,960
to have people look at the same data.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,376
The human brain has an amazing ability
for pattern recognition,

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,616
sometimes even better than a computer.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,176
However, there was a lot
of skepticism around this.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,736
My colleague, Debra Fischer,
founder of the Planet Hunters project,

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,736
said that people at the time were saying,

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,880
"You're crazy. There's no way
that a computer will miss a signal."

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,776
And so it was on, the classic
human versus machine gamble.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,976
And if we found one planet,
we would be thrilled.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,456
When I joined the team four years ago,

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,920
we had already found a couple.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,016
And today, with the help
of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,

38
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,816
we have found dozens,

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,096
and we've also found
one of the most mysterious stars

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
in our galaxy.

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,496
So to understand this,

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,720
let me show you what a normal transit
in Kepler data looks like.

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,056
On this graph on the left-hand side
you have the amount of light,

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,936
and on the bottom is time.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,016
The white line
is light just from the star,

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,416
what astronomers call a light curve.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,296
Now, when a planet transits a star,
it blocks out a little bit of this light,

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,776
and the depth of this transit
reflects the size of the object itself.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,416
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,576
Planets don't get
much bigger than Jupiter.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,376
Jupiter will make a one percent drop
in a star's brightness.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,576
Earth, on the other hand,
is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,416
and the signal
is barely visible in the data.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,720
So back to our mystery.

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,400
A few years ago, Planet Hunters were
sifting through data looking for transits,

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,160
and they spotted a mysterious signal
coming from the star KIC 8462852.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,936
The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,818
and they started talking about this
in the discussion forums.

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,416
They said and object like Jupiter

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,336
would make a drop like this
in the star's light,

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,696
but they were also saying it was giant.

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,936
You see, transits normally
only last for a few hours,

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,080
and this one lasted for almost a week.

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,416
They were also saying
that it looks asymmetric,

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,696
meaning that instead of the clean,
U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,216
it had this strange slope
that you can see on the left side.

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,576
This seemed to indicate

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,976
that whatever was getting in the way
and blocking the starlight

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
was not circular like a planet.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,136
There are few more dips that happened,

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,520
but for a couple of years,
it was pretty quiet.

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,560
And then in March of 2011, we see this.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,216
The star's light drops
by a whole 15 percent,

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,416
and this is huge compared to a planet,

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
which would only make a one percent drop.

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,016
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,056
It also is asymmetric,

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,736
having a gradual dimming
that lasts almost a week,

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,920
and then it snaps right back up to normal
in just a matter of days.

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,176
And again, after this, not much happens

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,896
until February of 2013.

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,536
Things start to get really crazy.

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,056
There is a huge complex of dips
in the light curve that appear,

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,216
and they last for like a hundred days,

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,480
all the way up
into the Kepler mission's end.

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,256
These dips have variable shapes.

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,496
Some are very sharp, and some are broad,

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,776
and they also have variable durations.

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Some last just for a day or two,
and some for more than a week.

90
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,456
And there's also up and down trends
within some of these dips,

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,160
almost like several independent events
were superimposed on top of each other.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,136
And at this time, this star drops
in its brightness over 20 percent.

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,303
This means that whatever
is blocking its light

94
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,767
has an area of over 1,000 times
the area of our planet Earth.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,440
This is truly remarkable.

96
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,736
And so the citizen scientists,
when they saw this,

97
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,456
they notified the science team
that they found something weird enough

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,920
that it might be worth following up.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,736
And so when the science team looked at it,

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,141
we're like, "Yeah, there's probably
just something wrong with the data."

101
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,696
But we looked really, really, really hard,

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
and the data were good.

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,776
And so what was happening
had to be astrophysical,

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,456
meaning that something in space
was getting in the way

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
and blocking starlight.

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,456
And so at this point,

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,056
we set out to learn
everything we could about the star

108
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,000
to see if we could find any clues
to what was going on.

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,896
And the citizen scientists
who helped us in this discovery,

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,456
they joined along for the ride

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,560
watching science in action firsthand.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,456
First, somebody said, you know,
what if this star was very young

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,080
and it still had the cloud of material
it was born from surrounding it.

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,456
And then somebody else said,

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,256
well, what if the star
had already formed planets,

116
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,496
and two of these planets had collided,

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,640
similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.

118
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,976
Well, both of these theories
could explain part of the data,

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,416
but the difficulties were that the star
showed no signs of being young,

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,376
and there was no glow
from any of the material

121
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,496
that was heated up by the star's light,

122
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,376
and you would expect this
if the star was young

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,960
or if there was a collision
and a lot of dust was produced.

124
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,416
And so somebody else said,

125
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,416
well, how about a huge swarm of comets

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,096
that are passing by this star
in a very elliptical orbit?

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, it ends up that this is actually
consistent with our observations.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,256
But I agree, it does feel
a little contrived.

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,576
You see, it would take hundreds of comets

130
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,240
to reproduce what we're observing.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,776
And these are only the comets

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,416
that happen to pass
between us and the star.

133
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,896
And so in reality, we're talking
thousands to tens of thousands of comets.

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,376
But of all the bad ideas we had,

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,536
this one was the best.

136
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,496
And so we went ahead
and published our findings.

137
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,736
Now, let me tell you, this was one
of the hardest papers I ever wrote.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,096
Scientists are meant to publish results,

139
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
and this situation was far from that.

140
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,096
And so we decided
to give it a catchy title,

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,296
and we called it: "Where's The Flux?"

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,400
I will let you work out the acronym.

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,880
(Laughter)

144
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,536
So this isn't the end of the story.

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,736
Around the same time
I was writing this paper,

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,896
I met with a colleague
of mine, Jason Wright,

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,136
and he was also writing a paper
on Kepler data.

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,336
And he was saying that with Kepler's
extreme precision,

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,216
it could actually detect
alien megastructures around stars,

150
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
but it didn't.

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
And then I showed him this weird data
that our citizen scientists had found,

152
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,775
and he said to me,

153
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,576
"Aw crap, Tabby.

154
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,559
Now I have to rewrite my paper."

155
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,640
So yes, the natural
explanations were weak,

156
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,056
and we were curious now.

157
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,256
So we had to find a way
to rule out aliens.

158
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,136
So together, we convinced
a colleague of ours

159
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,416
who works on SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

160
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,360
that this would be
an extraordinary target to pursue.

161
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,856
We wrote a proposal to observe the star

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,056
with the world's largest radio telescope
at the Green Bank Observatory.

163
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,456
A couple months later,

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
news of this proposal
got leaked to the press

165
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,216
and now there are thousands of articles,

166
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,376
over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.

167
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,240
And if you search Google Images,

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,120
this is what you'll find.

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,096
Now, you may be wondering,
OK, Tabby, well,

170
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,976
how do aliens actually explain
this light curve?

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,296
OK, well, imagine a civilization
that's much more advanced than our own.

172
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,640
In this hypothetical circumstance,

173
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,336
this civilization would have exhausted
the energy supply of their home planet,

174
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,536
so where could they get more energy?

175
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,360
Well, they have a host star
just like we have a sun,

176
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,296
and so if they were able
to capture more energy from this star,

177
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
then that would solve their energy needs.

178
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,216
So they would go
and build huge structures.

179
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,016
These giant megastructures,

180
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,760
like ginormous solar panels,
are called Dyson spheres.

181
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,736
This image above

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,936
are lots of artists' impressions
of Dyson spheres.

183
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,976
It's really hard to provide perspective
on the vastness of these things,

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,816
but you can think of it this way.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,880
The Earth-Moon distance
is a quarter of a million miles.

186
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,936
The simplest element
on one of these structures

187
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
is 100 times that size.

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,720
They're enormous.

189
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,496
And now imagine one of these structures
in motion around a star.

190
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,616
You can see how it would produce
anomalies in the data

191
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,856
such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.

192
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,856
But it remains that even
alien megastructures

193
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,296
cannot defy the laws of physics.

194
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,760
You see, anything that uses
a lot of energy

195
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,560
is going to produce heat,

196
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,816
and we don't observe this.

197
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,536
But it could be something as simple

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,016
as they're just reradiating it away
in another direction,

199
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
just not at Earth.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,440
Another idea that's one
of my personal favorites

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,096
is that we had just witnessed
an interplanetary space battle

202
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
and the catastrophic
destruction of a planet.

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,776
Now, I admit that this
would produce a lot of dust

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,696
that we don't observe.

205
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,056
But if we're already invoking aliens
in this explanation,

206
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,776
then who is to say they didn't
efficiently clean up all this mess

207
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,336
for recycling purposes?

208
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,376
(Laughter)

209
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,360
You can see how this quickly
captures your imagination.

210
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,016
Well, there you have it.

211
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,256
We're in a situation that could unfold

212
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,696
to be a natural phenomenon
we don't understand

213
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,280
or an alien technology
we don't understand.

214
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,840
Personally, as a scientist,
my money is on the natural explanation.

215
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,360
But don't get me wrong, I do think
it would be awesome to find aliens.

216
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,320
Either way, there is something new
and really interesting to discover.

217
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,896
So what happens next?

218
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,576
We need to continue to observe this star

219
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,016
to learn more about what's happening.

220
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,616
But professional astronomers, like me,

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,456
we have limited resources
for this kind of thing,

222
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,400
and Kepler is on to a different mission.

223
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,616
And I'm happy to say that once again,

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,760
citizen scientists have come in
and saved the day.

225
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,336
You see, this time,

226
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,240
amateur astronomers
with their backyard telescopes

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,096
stepped up immediately
and started observing this star nightly

228
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,616
at their own facilities,

229
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,440
and I am so excited to see what they find.

230
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,696
What's amazing to me is that this star
would have never been found by computers

231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,360
because we just weren't looking
for something like this.

232
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,656
And what's more exciting

233
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,320
is that there's more data to come.

234
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,176
There are new missions that are coming up

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,880
that are observing millions more stars

236
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
all over the sky.

237
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,800
And just think: What will it mean
when we find another star like this?

238
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,600
And what will it mean
if we don't find another star like this?

239
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,496
Thank you.

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,441
(Applause)
