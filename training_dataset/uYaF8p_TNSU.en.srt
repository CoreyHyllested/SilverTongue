0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,536
I feel incredibly lucky

1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,416
to be from a country

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,296
that's generally considered
to be the best place in the world

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,760
to be a woman.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,456
In 1975, when I was seven years old,

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
women in Iceland went on a strike.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,616
They did no work that day,

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,416
whether they held professional jobs

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,560
or had the work of the home.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,776
They marched into
the center of Reykjavík --

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,375
90 percent of women participated --

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,176
and peacefully and in solidarity

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
asked for equality.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,080
Nothing worked in Iceland that day,

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,736
because nothing works
when women are not at work.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,040
(Applause)

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,336
Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,496
to be the first country in the world

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,936
to democratically elect a woman
as their president.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,776
I will never forget this day,

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,976
that President Vigdís,
as we know her by her first name,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,376
stepped out on the balcony
of her own home,

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,616
a single mom with her daughter
by her side as she had won.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,120
(Applause)

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,696
This woman was an incredible role model

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,056
for me and everyone
growing up at that time,

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,280
including boys.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,896
She frequently shares the story
of how a young boy approached her

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,936
after a couple of terms in office

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,856
and asked, "Can boys
really grow up to be president?"

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,016
(Laughter)

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,816
Role models really matter,

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,656
but even with such strong role models

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,976
who I am so grateful for,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,856
when I was encouraged
to run for president,

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,216
my first reaction was,
"Who am I to run for president?

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,600
Who am I to be president?"

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,015
It turns out that women

38
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,600
are less likely
to consider running than men.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,976
So a study done in the US in 2011

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,240
showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,096
but 45 percent of women.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,496
That's gap of 16 percentage points,

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,000
and it's the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,296
And it really is a shame,

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,336
because I am so convinced that the world
is in real need for women leaders

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,416
and more principle-based leadership

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
in general.

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,600
So my decision to run

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,136
ultimately came down to the fact

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,360
that I felt

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,640
that I had to do my bit,

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,040
even if I had no political experience,

53
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,560
to step up and try to be part
of creating the world

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,376
that will make sense and be sustainable

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,936
for our kids,

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,336
and a world where we truly allow
both our boys and girls

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
to be all they can be.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,440
And it was the journey of my life.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
It was amazing.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,576
The journey started with potentially
as many as 20 candidates.

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,016
It boiled down to
nine candidates qualifying,

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,280
and ultimately the race
came down to four of us,

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,016
three men and me.

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,720
(Applause)

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,456
But that's not all the drama yet.

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,736
You may think you have drama in the US,

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,976
but I can --

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,440
(Laughter)

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,056
I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,016
So our sitting president of 20 years

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,696
announced initially
that he was not going to run,

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,296
which is probably what gave rise

73
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,720
to so many candidates considering running.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,096
Then later he changed his mind

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,656
when our prime minister resigned

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,935
following the infamous Panama Papers

77
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,856
that implicated him and his family.

78
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,936
And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,240
so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,016
A few days later, relations
to his wife and her family's companies

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
were also discovered in the Panama Papers,

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,640
and so he withdrew from the race again.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,296
Before doing so, he said he was doing that

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
because now there were two qualified men

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,880
who he felt could fill his shoes
running for office.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,456
So on May 9, 45 days before election day,

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,680
it was not looking too good for me.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,056
I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,056
The polls had me at 1 percent,

90
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,536
but that was still the highest

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,176
So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,496
to get my seat at the table

94
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,976
and access to television,

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,416
because the network decided
that they would only include

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,856
those with 2,5 percent
or more in the polls

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
in the first TV debate.

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,056
I found out on the afternoon
of the first TV debate

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,816
that I would participate
along with the three men,

100
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,256
and I found out on live TV

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,616
that I came in at exactly 2,5 percent
on the day of the first TV debate.

102
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,720
(Applause)

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
So, challenges.

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,976
The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,896
had to do with media, muscle and money.

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,736
Let's start with media.

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,136
There are those who say
gender doesn't matter

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,896
when it comes to media and politics.

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
I can't say that I agree.

110
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,040
It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,136
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media

112
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,256
87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,

113
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,400
whereas I appeared 31 times.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,856
And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.

115
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,776
I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,600
because in media,
much like everywhere else,

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,096
we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,576
and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,736
When I finally got access to TV,

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,920
the first question I got was,
"Are you going to quit?"

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,336
And that was a hard one.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,216
But of course, with 1 percent
to 2,5 percent in the polls,

123
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,520
maybe it's understandable.

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,856
But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,096
we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,

126
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,736
so I know firsthand how much this matters

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,056
and why we have to talk about it.

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,496
I was the only one
out of the final four candidates

129
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,816
that never got a front page interview.

130
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,936
I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,080
and out of coverage about the elections.

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,976
So I did face this,

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,456
but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,176
I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.

135
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,776
(Applause)

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
So kudos to them.

137
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,096
But there is another experience
that's very important.

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,376
I ran as an independent candidate,

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,696
not with any political party
or muscle behind me.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,056
That lack of experience

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,336
and lack of access to resources

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,376
probably came at a cost to our campaign,

143
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,016
but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.

144
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,280
We ran a positive campaign,

145
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,880
and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,176
It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,

147
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,280
because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,616
When access to media
proved to be so difficult,

149
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,696
we ran our own media.

150
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,576
I ran live Facebook sessions

151
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,720
where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.

152
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,856
And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,936
because we thought
transparency is important

154
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
if you want to establish trust.

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,256
And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I became a Snapchatter.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,536
I got young people
to teach me how to do that,

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,816
and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.

159
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,056
And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.

160
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,096
But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,296
So it's possible to run
a different type of campaign.

162
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,400
But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,816
I am sad that it is that way,
but it's true,

164
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,920
and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,896
This probably was partly due to the fact

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,016
that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,416
And maybe I also had the ambition
to do more with less.

168
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,400
Some would call that very womanly of me.

169
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,216
But even with one third the media,
one third the financial resources,

170
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,776
and only an entrepreneurial team,
but an amazing team,

171
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,976
we managed to surprise everyone
on election night,

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
when the first numbers came in.

173
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,296
I surprised myself,
as you may see in that photo.

174
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
(Laughter)

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,280
So the first numbers,

176
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,816
I came in neck to neck
to the leading candidate.

177
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,240
(Cheers)

178
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,656
Well, too early,
because I didn't quite pull that,

179
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,176
but I came in second,

180
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,376
and we went a long way
from the one percent,

181
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,376
with nearly a third of the vote,

182
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,416
and we beat the polls
by an unprecedented margin,

183
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,320
or 10 percentage points
above what the last poll came in at.

184
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,656
Some people call me the real winner
of the election because of this,

185
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
and there are many people
who encouraged me to run again.

186
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,096
But what really makes me proud

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,776
is to know that I earned

188
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,496
proportionately higher percentage
support from the young people,

189
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,656
and a lot of people encouraged
my daughter to run in 2040.

190
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
(Applause)

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,880
She is 13,

192
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,376
and she had never been on TV before.

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,656
And on election day,
I observed her on TV repeatedly,

194
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,016
and she was smart, she was self-confident,

195
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,416
she was sincere, and she was
supportive of her mother.

196
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,616
This was probably
the highlight of my campaign.

197
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,200
(Applause)

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,416
But there was another one.

199
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,976
These are preschool girls out on a walk,

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,176
and they found
a poster of me on a bus stop,

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,416
and they saw the need to kiss it.

202
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,136
Audience: Aw!

203
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,640
This picture was really
enough of a win for me.

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,560
What we see, we can be.

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,336
So screw fear and challenges.

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,736
(Applause)

207
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,016
It matters that women run,

208
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,976
and it's time for women to run for office,

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,920
be it the office of the CEO
or the office of the president.

210
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,240
I also managed to put an impression
on your very own "New Yorker."

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,696
I earned a new title,
"A living emoji of sincerity."

212
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
(Cheers)

213
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,840
It is possibly my proudest title yet,

214
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,576
and the reason is
that women too often get penalized

215
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,176
for using what I call
their emotional capital,

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,096
but I know from experience
that we become so good

217
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,816
when we do just that.

218
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,400
(Applause)

219
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,440
And we need more of that.

220
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,696
We celebrated as if we had won
on election night,

221
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,496
because that's how we felt.

222
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,856
So you don't necessarily
have to reach that office.

223
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,616
You just have to go for it,

224
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,696
and you, your family, your friends,
everyone working with you,

225
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,240
if you do it well, you will grow beyond
anything you will experience before.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,480
So we had a good time,

227
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,096
and I learned a lot on this journey,

228
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,856
probably more lessons
than I can share here

229
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,656
in the time we have today.

230
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,176
But rest assured, it was hard work.

231
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,920
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.

232
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,376
It took resilience
and perseverance to not quit,

233
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,656
but I learned something
that I knew before on the one percent day,

234
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,696
and that is that you can only be good

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,616
when you are truly, authentically
listening to your own voice

236
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,320
and working in alignment with that.

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,696
As a good sister of mine sometimes says,

238
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,296
you may cheat on your intuition,

239
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,760
but your intuition never cheats on you.

240
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,816
I think it's also very important,
and you all know this,

241
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,416
that on any journey you go on,

242
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,080
it's the team you take along.

243
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,376
It's having people around you
who share your values, your vision,

244
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,440
but are different in every other way.

245
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,416
That's the formula for success for me,

246
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,896
and I am blessed with an amazing husband,

247
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,120
here today,

248
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,816
an incredible family --

249
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,776
(Applause)

250
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,016
and great friends,

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,416
and we came together
as entrepreneurs in the political arena,

252
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,256
and pulled something off
that everyone said would be impossible.

253
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,456
As a matter of fact,
the leading PR expert told me

254
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,216
before I made my decision

255
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,880
that I would do well to get seven percent.

256
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,856
I appreciated his perspective,
because he was probably right,

257
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,056
and he was basing it
on valuable experience.

258
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,416
But on the one percent day,

259
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
I decided here to show him
that he was wrong.

260
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,696
It's very important to mention this,
because I did lose a lot of sleep,

261
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,040
and I worked hard,
and so did the people with me.

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,536
We can never go the distance
if we forget to take care of ourselves.

263
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,416
And it's two things that I think
are very important in that,

264
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,976
in surrounding yourself with people
and practices that nourish you,

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,776
but it's equally important,
maybe even more important,

266
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,536
to have the courage
to get rid of people and practices

267
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,616
that take away your energy,

268
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,280
including the wonderful bloggers
and commentators.

269
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,176
I took a lot of support
from others in doing this,

270
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,256
and I made the decision to go high
when others went low,

271
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,136
and that's partly how I kept
my energy going throughout all of this.

272
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,336
And when I lost my energy for a moment --

273
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,656
and I did from time to time,
it wasn't easy --

274
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,976
I went back to why I decided to run,

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,400
and how I had decided to run my own race.

276
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,096
I called it a 4G campaign,

277
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,896
the G's representing the Icelandic words.

278
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,056
And the first one is called "Gagn."

279
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,336
I ran to do good,

280
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,576
to be of service,

281
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,096
and I wanted servant leadership

282
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,640
to be at the center of how I worked
and everybody else in the campaign.

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,216
Second one is "Gleði," or joy.

284
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,336
I decided to enjoy the journey.

285
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,576
There was a lot to be taken
out of the journey,

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,216
no matter if the destination
was reached or not.

287
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,320
And I tried my utmost
to inspire others to do so as well.

288
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,976
Third is "Gagnsæi."

289
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,736
I was open to any questions.

290
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,296
I kept no secrets,

291
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,416
and it was all open,
on Facebook and websites.

292
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,816
Because I think if you're
choosing your president,

293
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,920
you deserve answers to your questions.

294
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,136
Last but not least,

295
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,536
I don't need to explain that in this room,

296
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,456
we ran on the principle of Girlpower.

297
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
(Cheers)

298
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,176
I am incredibly glad

299
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,416
that I had the courage to run,

300
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,496
to risk failure but receive success

301
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,400
on so many levels.

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,936
I can't tell you that it was easy,

303
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,056
but I can tell you,

304
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,736
and I think my entire team
will agree with me,

305
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,800
that it was worth it.

306
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,816
Thank you.

307
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,536
(Applause)

308
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
Thank you.

309
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,976
Thank you.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
(Applause)

311
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,930
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.

312
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,690
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.

313
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,935
PM: I can't let you go
without saying

314
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,935
that probably everybody in the room
is ready to move to Iceland

315
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,656
and vote for you.

316
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,736
But of course we probably
can't vote there,

317
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,136
but one thing we can get from Iceland

318
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,976
and have always gotten is inspiration.

319
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,176
I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,216
when all the Icelandic women walked out,

321
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,816
and that really was a very big factor
in launching the women's movement.

322
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,296
You made a reference to it earlier.
I'd love to bring the picture back up

323
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,536
and just have us remember what it was like
when a country came to a standstill.

324
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,896
And then what you may not know

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,936
because our American media
did not report it,

326
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,856
the Icelandic women
walked out again on Monday. Right?

327
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,547
HT: Yes, they did.
PM: Can you tell us about that?

328
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:20,376
HT: Yes, so 41 years
after the original strike,

329
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,656
we may be the best place
in the world to be a woman,

330
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,016
but our work isn't done.

331
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,656
So at 2:38pm on Monday,

332
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,376
women in Iceland left work,

333
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,296
because that's when
they had earned their day's salary.

334
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,280
(Applause)

335
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,456
What's really cool about this

336
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,176
is that young women and men participated

337
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,376
in greater numbers than before,

338
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
because it is time
that we close the pay gap.

339
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,576
PM: So I'm not going to ask
Halla to commit right now

340
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,856
to what she's doing next,

341
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,256
but I will say that you'd have
a very large volunteer army

342
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,696
should you decide to do that again.

343
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,976
Thank you Halla.

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,416
HT: Thank you all.

345
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,835
(Applause)
