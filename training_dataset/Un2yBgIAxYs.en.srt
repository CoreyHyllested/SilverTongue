00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,200
Imagine you're walking through a forest.

1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,096
I'm guessing you're thinking
of a collection of trees,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,856
what we foresters call a stand,

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,520
with their rugged stems
and their beautiful crowns.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,920
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
but a forest is much more
than what you see,

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,240
and today I want to change
the way you think about forests.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,256
You see, underground
there is this other world,

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,336
a world of infinite biological pathways

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,776
that connect trees
and allow them to communicate

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,280
and allow the forest to behave
as though it's a single organism.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,760
It might remind you
of a sort of intelligence.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,256
How do I know this?

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,520
Here's my story.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,720
I grew up in the forests
of British Columbia.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,256
I used to lay on the forest floor
and stare up at the tree crowns.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,520
They were giants.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,896
My grandfather was a giant, too.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,376
He was a horse logger,

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,960
and he used to selectively cut
cedar poles from the inland rainforest.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,736
Grandpa taught me about the quiet
and cohesive ways of the woods,

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,160
and how my family was knit into it.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,216
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,800
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,936
and my first big "aha" moment

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,840
was at the outhouse by our lake.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,760
Our poor dog Jigs
had slipped and fallen into the pit.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,216
So grandpa ran up with his shovel
to rescue the poor dog.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,480
He was down there, swimming in the muck.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,696
But as grandpa dug
through that forest floor,

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,336
I became fascinated with the roots,

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,456
and under that, what I learned later
was the white mycelium

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,560
and under that the red
and yellow mineral horizons.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,416
Eventually, grandpa and I
rescued the poor dog,

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,776
but it was at that moment that I realized

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,376
that that palette of roots and soil

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,840
was really the foundation of the forest.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,040
And I wanted to know more.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,400
So I studied forestry.

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,056
But soon I found myself working
alongside the powerful people

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
in charge of the commercial harvest.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,536
The extent of the clear-cutting

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,816
was alarming,

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,000
and I soon found myself
conflicted by my part in it.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,696
Not only that, the spraying
and hacking of the aspens and birches

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,016
to make way for the more commercially
valuable planted pines and firs

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,240
was astounding.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,760
It seemed that nothing could stop
this relentless industrial machine.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
So I went back to school,

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,320
and I studied my other world.

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,736
You see, scientists had just discovered
in the laboratory in vitro

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,896
that one pine seedling root

52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,320
could transmit carbon
to another pine seedling root.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,936
But this was in the laboratory,

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,016
and I wondered,
could this happen in real forests?

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
I thought yes.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,080
Trees in real forests might also
share information below ground.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,896
But this was really controversial,

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,536
and some people thought I was crazy,

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,616
and I had a really hard time
getting research funding.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,080
But I persevered,

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,056
and I eventually conducted
some experiments deep in the forest,

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,480
25 years ago.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,016
I grew 80 replicates of three species:

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,216
paper birch, Douglas fir,
and western red cedar.

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,296
I figured the birch and the fir
would be connected in a belowground web,

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,576
but not the cedar.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,120
It was in its own other world.

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,296
And I gathered my apparatus,

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,496
and I had no money,
so I had to do it on the cheap.

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,136
So I went to Canadian Tire --

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,576
(Laughter)

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,016
and I bought some plastic bags
and duct tape and shade cloth,

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,280
a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,336
And then I borrowed some
high-tech stuff from my university:

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,976
a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,
a mass spectrometer, microscopes.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,456
And then I got some
really dangerous stuff:

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,256
syringes full of radioactive
carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,296
and some high pressure bottles

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,840
of the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,136
But I was legally permitted.

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,856
(Laughter)

82
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,800
important stuff: the bug spray,

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,440
the bear spray,
the filters for my respirator.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh well.

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,336
The first day of the experiment,
we got out to our plot

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,160
and a grizzly bear and her cub
chased us off.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,440
And I had no bear spray.

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,296
But you know, this is how
forest research in Canada goes.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,776
(Laughter)

91
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,336
So I came back the next day,

92
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,616
and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.

93
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,656
So this time, we really got started,

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,456
and I pulled on my white paper suit,

95
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,320
I put on my respirator,

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,376
and then

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,680
I put the plastic bags over my trees.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,176
I got my giant syringes,

99
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,856
and I injected the bags

100
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,296
with my tracer isotope
carbon dioxide gases,

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,536
first the birch.

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,536
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,136
into the bag of birch.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,416
And then for fir,

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,256
I injected the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,016
I used two isotopes,

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,296
because I was wondering

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
whether there was two-way communication
going on between these species.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,216
I got to the final bag,

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,736
the 80th replicate,

111
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,176
and all of a sudden
mama grizzly showed up again.

112
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,616
And she started to chase me,

113
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,056
and I had my syringes above my head,

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,016
and I was swatting the mosquitos,
and I jumped into the truck,

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,256
and I thought,

116
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,016
"This is why people do lab studies."

117
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
(Laughter)

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,616
I waited an hour.

119
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,256
I figured it would take this long

120
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,056
for the trees to suck up
the CO2 through photosynthesis,

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,216
turn it into sugars,
send it down into their roots,

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,936
and maybe, I hypothesized,

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,760
shuttle that carbon belowground
to their neighbors.

124
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,776
After the hour was up,

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,376
I rolled down my window,

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
and I checked for mama grizzly.

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh good, she's over there
eating her huckleberries.

128
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,336
So I got out of the truck
and I got to work.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,256
I went to my first bag with the birch.
I pulled the bag off.

130
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,600
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
Kkhh!

132
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,616
Perfect.

133
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,576
The birch had taken up
the radioactive gas.

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,176
Then the moment of truth.

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,720
I went over to the fir tree.

136
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,096
I pulled off its bag.

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,456
I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,680
and I heard the most beautiful sound.

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Kkhh!

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,496
It was the sound of birch talking to fir,

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,976
and birch was saying,
"Hey, can I help you?"

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,616
And fir was saying, "Yeah,
can you send me some of your carbon?

143
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,040
Because somebody
threw a shade cloth over me."

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,056
I went up to cedar, and I ran
the Geiger counter over its leaves,

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
and as I suspected,

146
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,760
silence.

147
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,776
Cedar was in its own world.

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,760
It was not connected into the web
interlinking birch and fir.

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
I was so excited,

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,976
I ran from plot to plot
and I checked all 80 replicates.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,136
The evidence was clear.

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,096
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,240
that paper birch and Douglas fir
were in a lively two-way conversation.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,816
It turns out at that time of the year,

155
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,056
in the summer,

156
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,736
that birch was sending more carbon to fir
than fir was sending back to birch,

157
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,056
especially when the fir was shaded.

158
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,056
And then in later experiments,
we found the opposite,

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,616
that fir was sending more carbon to birch
than birch was sending to fir,

160
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,280
and this was because the fir was still
growing while the birch was leafless.

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,536
So it turns out the two species
were interdependent,

162
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
like yin and yang.

163
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,936
And at that moment,
everything came into focus for me.

164
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,216
I knew I had found something big,

165
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,976
something that would change the way
we look at how trees interact in forests,

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,016
from not just competitors

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
but to cooperators.

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,256
And I had found solid evidence

169
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,656
of this massive belowground
communications network,

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
the other world.

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,856
Now, I truly hoped and believed

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,496
that my discovery would change
how we practice forestry,

173
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,296
from clear-cutting and herbiciding

174
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,256
to more holistic and sustainable methods,

175
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,496
methods that were less expensive
and more practical.

176
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,760
What was I thinking?

177
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll come back to that.

178
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,600
So how do we do science
in complex systems like forests?

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,056
Well, as forest scientists,
we have to do our research in the forests,

180
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,096
and that's really tough,
as I've shown you.

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,360
And we have to be really good
at running from bears.

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,336
But mostly, we have to persevere

183
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,256
in spite of all the stuff
stacked against us.

184
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,896
And we have to follow our intuition
and our experiences

185
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,056
and ask really good questions.

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,256
And then we've got to gather our data
and then go verify.

187
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,440
For me, I've conducted and published
hundreds of experiments in the forest.

188
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Some of my oldest experimental plantations
are now over 30 years old.

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,456
You can check them out.

190
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
That's how forest science works.

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,536
So now I want to talk about the science.

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,616
How were paper birch
and Douglas fir communicating?

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,136
Well, it turns out they were conversing
not only in the language of carbon

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,176
but also nitrogen and phosphorus

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,936
and water and defense signals
and allele chemicals and hormones --

196
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
information.

197
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,336
And you know, I have to tell you,
before me, scientists had thought

198
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,936
that this belowground
mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,456
was involved.

200
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,560
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,256
You see their reproductive organs
when you walk through the forest.

202
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,096
They're the mushrooms.

203
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,136
The mushrooms, though,
are just the tip of the iceberg,

204
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,416
because coming out of those stems
are fungal threads that form a mycelium,

205
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,136
and that mycelium
infects and colonizes the roots

206
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,296
of all the trees and plants.

207
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,976
And where the fungal cells
interact with the root cells,

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,776
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,

209
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,856
and that fungus gets those nutrients
by growing through the soil

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
and coating every soil particle.

211
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,136
The web is so dense that there can be
hundreds of kilometers of mycelium

212
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,720
under a single footstep.

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,520
And not only that, that mycelium connects
different individuals in the forest,

214
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,936
individuals not only of the same species
but between species, like birch and fir,

215
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,280
and it works kind of like the Internet.

216
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,656
You see, like all networks,

217
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,496
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.

218
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,576
We made this map by examining
the short sequences of DNA

219
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,096
of every tree and every fungal individual
in a patch of Douglas fir forest.

220
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,936
In this picture, the circles represent
the Douglas fir, or the nodes,

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,080
and the lines represent the interlinking
fungal highways, or the links.

222
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,456
The biggest, darkest nodes
are the busiest nodes.

223
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,416
We call those hub trees,

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,856
or more fondly, mother trees,

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,496
because it turns out
that those hub trees nurture their young,

226
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,056
the ones growing in the understory.

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,216
And if you can see those yellow dots,

228
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,536
those are the young seedlings
that have established within the network

229
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,800
of the old mother trees.

230
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,600
In a single forest, a mother tree can be
connected to hundreds of other trees.

231
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,096
And using our isotope tracers,

232
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,616
we have found that mother trees

233
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,576
will send their excess carbon
through the mycorrhizal network

234
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,536
to the understory seedlings,

235
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,696
and we've associated this
with increased seedling survival

236
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
by four times.

237
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,096
Now, we know we all
favor our own children,

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,360
and I wondered, could Douglas fir
recognize its own kin,

239
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
like mama grizzly and her cub?

240
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,376
So we set about an experiment,

241
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,296
and we grew mother trees
with kin and stranger's seedlings.

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,216
And it turns out
they do recognize their kin.

243
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,216
Mother trees colonize their kin
with bigger mycorrhizal networks.

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,656
They send them more carbon below ground.

245
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,256
They even reduce
their own root competition

246
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,136
to make elbow room for their kids.

247
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,816
When mother trees are injured or dying,

248
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,360
they also send messages of wisdom
on to the next generation of seedlings.

249
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,656
So we've used isotope tracing

250
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,256
to trace carbon moving
from an injured mother tree

251
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,616
down her trunk
into the mycorrhizal network

252
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
and into her neighboring seedlings,

253
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,416
not only carbon but also defense signals.

254
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,256
And these two compounds

255
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,376
have increased the resistance
of those seedlings to future stresses.

256
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,680
So trees talk.

257
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,576
(Applause)

258
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
Thank you.

259
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,736
Through back and forth conversations,

260
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,440
they increase the resilience
of the whole community.

261
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,256
It probably reminds you
of our own social communities,

262
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,856
and our families,

263
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,261
well, at least some families.

264
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,496
(Laughter)

265
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,425
So let's come back to the initial point.

266
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,936
Forests aren't simply
collections of trees,

267
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,496
they're complex systems
with hubs and networks

268
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,016
that overlap and connect trees
and allow them to communicate,

269
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,816
and they provide avenues
for feedbacks and adaptation,

270
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,256
and this makes the forest resilient.

271
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,656
That's because there are many hub trees
and many overlapping networks.

272
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,656
But they're also vulnerable,

273
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,560
vulnerable not only
to natural disturbances

274
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,896
like bark beetles that preferentially
attack big old trees

275
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,360
but high-grade logging
and clear-cut logging.

276
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,056
You see, you can take out
one or two hub trees,

277
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,800
but there comes a tipping point,

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,856
because hub trees are not
unlike rivets in an airplane.

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,416
You can take out one or two
and the plane still flies,

280
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,016
but you take out one too many,

281
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,656
or maybe that one holding on the wings,

282
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,520
and the whole system collapses.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,896
So now how are you thinking
about forests? Differently?

284
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,136
(Audience) Yes.

285
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
Cool.

286
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm glad.

287
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,776
So, remember I said earlier
that I hoped that my research,

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,176
my discoveries would change
the way we practice forestry.

289
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,320
Well, I want to take a check on that
30 years later here in western Canada.

290
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,376
This is about 100 kilometers
to the west of us,

291
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,760
just on the border of Banff National Park.

292
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
That's a lot of clear-cuts.

293
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,460
It's not so pristine.

294
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,036
In 2014, the World Resources Institute
reported that Canada in the past decade

295
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,660
has had the highest forest disturbance
rate of any country worldwide,

296
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,340
and I bet you thought it was Brazil.

297
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,676
In Canada, it's 3,6 percent per year.

298
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,620
Now, by my estimation, that's about
four times the rate that is sustainable.

299
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,436
Now, massive disturbance at this scale
is known to affect hydrological cycles,

300
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,436
degrade wildlife habitat,

301
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,356
and emit greenhouse gases
back into the atmosphere,

302
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,300
which creates more disturbance
and more tree diebacks.

303
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,276
Not only that, we're continuing
to plant one or two species

304
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
and weed out the aspens and birches.

305
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,836
These simplified forests lack complexity,

306
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,276
and they're really vulnerable
to infections and bugs.

307
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,196
And as climate changes,

308
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,500
this is creating a perfect storm

309
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,996
for extreme events, like the massive
mountain pine beetle outbreak

310
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,060
that just swept across North America,

311
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,140
or that megafire in the last
couple months in Alberta.

312
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,300
So I want to come back
to my final question:

313
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,756
instead of weakening our forests,

314
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,340
how can we reinforce them
and help them deal with climate change?

315
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,716
Well, you know, the great thing
about forests as complex systems

316
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,780
is they have enormous
capacity to self-heal.

317
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,116
In our recent experiments,

318
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,596
we found with patch-cutting
and retention of hub trees

319
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,756
and regeneration to a diversity
of species and genes and genotypes

320
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,620
that these mycorrhizal networks,
they recover really rapidly.

321
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,276
So with this in mind, I want to leave you
with four simple solutions.

322
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,660
And we can't kid ourselves
that these are too complicated to act on.

323
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,380
First, we all need
to get out in the forest.

324
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,036
We need to reestablish
local involvement in our own forests.

325
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,676
You see, most of our forests now

326
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,916
are managed using
a one-size-fits-all approach,

327
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,300
but good forest stewardship
requires knowledge of local conditions.

328
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,100
Second, we need to save
our old-growth forests.

329
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,740
These are the repositories of genes
and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.

330
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,876
So this means less cutting.

331
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,940
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.

332
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,635
And third, when we do cut,

333
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,460
we need to save the legacies,

334
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,716
the mother trees and networks,

335
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,875
and the wood, the genes,

336
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,796
so they can pass their wisdom
onto the next generation of trees

337
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,940
so they can withstand
the future stresses coming down the road.

338
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,700
We need to be conservationists.

339
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,539
And finally, fourthly and finally,

340
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,796
we need to regenerate our forests
with a diversity of species

341
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,036
and genotypes and structures

342
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,820
by planting and allowing
natural regeneration.

343
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,516
We have to give Mother Nature
the tools she needs

344
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,260
to use her intelligence to self-heal.

345
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,236
And we need to remember
that forests aren't just a bunch of trees

346
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,516
competing with each other,

347
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,460
they're supercooperators.

348
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,356
So back to Jigs.

349
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,836
Jigs's fall into the outhouse
showed me this other world,

350
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,556
and it changed my view of forests.

351
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,916
I hope today to have changed
how you think about forests.

352
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,196
Thank you.

353
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,997
(Applause)
