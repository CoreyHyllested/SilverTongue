00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,437
Hi.

1
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,807
Let me ask the audience a question:

2
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,026
Did you ever lie as a child?

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,717
If you did, could you please
raise your hand?

4
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:26,599
Wow! This is the most honest
group of people I've ever met.

5
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:28,580
(Laughter)

6
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,313
So for the last 20 years,

7
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:33,752
I've been studying
how children learn to tell lies.

8
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:36,080
And today, I'm going to share with you

9
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,266
some of the discoveries we have made.

10
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:43,549
But to begin, I'm going to tell you
a story from Mr. Richard Messina,

11
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,702
who is my friend and an elementary
school principal.

12
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,827
He got a phone call one day.

13
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,430
The caller says,

14
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:56,336
"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny
will not come to school today

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,823
because he's sick."

16
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:00,234
Mr. Messina asks,

17
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,272
"Who am I speaking to, please?"

18
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:04,278
And the caller says,

19
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:05,967
"I am my father."

20
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:08,778
(Laughter)

21
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:11,909
So this story --

22
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,465
(Laughter)

23
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,799
sums up very nicely
three common beliefs we have

24
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:19,682
about children and lying.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,771
One, children only come to tell lies

26
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:27,063
after entering elementary school.

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,863
Two, children are poor liars.

28
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,744
We adults can easily detect their lies.

29
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:36,806
And three, if children lie
at a very young age,

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,679
there must be some
character flaws with them,

31
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:43,752
and they are going to become
pathological liars for life.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,914
Well, it turns out

33
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:49,236
all of the three beliefs are wrong.

34
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:53,327
We have been playing guessing games

35
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,433
with children all over the world.

36
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:56,943
Here is an example.

37
00:01:56,967 --> 00:02:01,332
So in this game, we asked children
to guess the numbers on the cards.

38
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,836
And we tell them if they win the game,

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,017
they are going to get a big prize.

40
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,002
But in the middle of the game,

41
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,786
we make an excuse and leave the room.

42
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:15,697
And before we leave the room,

43
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,657
we tell them not to peek at the cards.

44
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:20,934
Of course,

45
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,119
we have hidden cameras in the room

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,938
to watch their every move.

47
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:29,633
Because the desire
to win the game is so strong,

48
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:33,143
more than 90 percent of children will peek

49
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,604
as soon as we leave the room.

50
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,628
(Laughter)

51
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,030
The crucial question is:

52
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,802
When we return and ask the children

53
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:44,135
whether or not they have peeked,

54
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,211
will the children who peeked confess

55
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,813
or lie about their transgression?

56
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:56,298
We found that regardless
of gender, country, religion,

57
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:58,513
at two years of age,

58
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,115
30 percent lie,

59
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,948
70 percent tell the truth
about their transgression.

60
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,110
At three years of age,

61
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:10,608
50 percent lie and 50 percent
tell the truth.

62
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,201
At four years of age,

63
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,172
more than 80 percent lie.

64
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,785
And after four years of age,

65
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,198
most children lie.

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,543
So as you can see,

67
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:26,030
lying is really a typical part
of development.

68
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:28,844
And some children begin to tell lies

69
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,307
as young as two years of age.

70
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,995
So now, let's take a closer look
at the younger children.

71
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:41,149
Why do some but not all
young children lie?

72
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,513
In cooking, you need good ingredients

73
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,150
to cook good food.

74
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:52,356
And good lying requires
two key ingredients.

75
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,219
The first key ingredient
is theory of mind,

76
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:59,078
or the mind-reading ability.

77
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,846
Mind reading is the ability to know

78
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,478
that different people have
different knowledge about the situation

79
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:10,303
and the ability to differentiate
between what I know

80
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:11,550
and what you know.

81
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,161
Mind reading is important for lying

82
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:18,032
because the basis of lying is that I know

83
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:19,207
you don't know

84
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,382
what I know.

85
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,777
Therefore, I can lie to you.

86
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,680
The second key ingredient
for good lying is self-control.

87
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:32,327
It is the ability to control your speech,
your facial expression

88
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,891
and your body language,

89
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,993
so that you can tell a convincing lie.

90
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:40,664
And we found that those young children

91
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:45,544
who have more advanced mind-reading
and self-control abilities

92
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:47,606
tell lies earlier

93
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,446
and are more sophisticated liars.

94
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:57,506
As it turns out, these two abilities
are also essential for all of us

95
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,052
to function well in our society.

96
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,183
In fact, deficits in mind-reading
and self-control abilities

97
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:08,766
are associated with serious
developmental problems,

98
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,549
such as ADHD and autism.

99
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:19,070
So if you discover your two-year-old
is telling his or her first lie,

100
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,078
instead of being alarmed,

101
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:22,594
you should celebrate --

102
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,140
(Laughter)

103
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:29,894
because it signals that your child
has arrived at a new milestone

104
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:31,553
of typical development.

105
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:36,221
Now, are children poor liars?

106
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,872
Do you think you can easily
detect their lies?

107
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,423
Would you like to give it a try?

108
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,401
Yes? OK.

109
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,564
So I'm going to show you two videos.

110
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,175
In the videos,

111
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,256
the children are going to respond
to a researcher's question,

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,762
"Did you peek?"

113
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,340
So try to tell me

114
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:55,762
which child is lying

115
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,896
and which child is telling the truth.

116
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,991
Here's child number one.

117
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,228
Are you ready?

118
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:04,926
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

119
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,855
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.

120
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,693
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

121
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,883
KL: OK, if you think
child number one is lying,

122
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:18,594
please raise your hand.

123
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:23,953
And if you think child number two
is lying, please raise your hand.

124
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,067
OK, so as a matter of fact,

125
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:31,028
child number one is telling the truth,

126
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,081
child number two is lying.

127
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:37,354
Looks like many of you are terrible
detectors of children's lies.

128
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,856
(Laughter)

129
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,264
Now, we have played similar kinds of games

130
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:47,913
with many, many adults
from all walks of life.

131
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,872
And we show them many videos.

132
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:53,896
In half of the videos, the children lied.

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,187
In the other half of the videos,
the children told the truth.

134
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,386
And let's find out
how these adults performed.

135
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,174
Because there are as many liars
as truth tellers,

136
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:08,597
if you guess randomly,

137
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:12,691
there's a 50 percent chance
you're going to get it right.

138
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:16,309
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,

139
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,774
it means you are a terrible detector
of children's lies.

140
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,819
So let's start with undergrads
and law school students,

141
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:28,515
who typically have
limited experience with children.

142
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,000
No, they cannot detect children's lies.

143
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:34,238
Their performance is around chance.

144
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:39,491
Now how about social workers
and child-protection lawyers,

145
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:42,189
who work with children on a daily basis?

146
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,300
Can they detect children's lies?

147
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:46,775
No, they cannot.

148
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,844
(Laughter)

149
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,340
What about judges,

150
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:51,164
customs officers

151
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:53,046
and police officers,

152
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,713
who deal with liars on a daily basis?

153
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,654
Can they detect children's lies?

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,014
No, they cannot.

155
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,616
What about parents?

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,654
Can parents detect other children's lies?

157
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,136
No, they cannot.

158
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,406
What about, can parents
detect their own children's lies?

159
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,409
No, they cannot.

160
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,909
(Laughter) (Applause)

161
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,480
So now you may ask

162
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:24,136
why children's lies
are so difficult to detect.

163
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,970
Let me illustrate this
with my own son, Nathan.

164
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,163
This is his facial expression

165
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,571
when he lies.

166
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,801
(Laughter)

167
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,427
So when children lie,

168
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,607
their facial expression
is typically neutral.

169
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:42,583
However, behind this neutral expression,

170
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,933
the child is actually experiencing
a lot of emotions,

171
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:49,812
such as fear, guilt, shame

172
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,932
and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.

173
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,658
(Laughter)

174
00:08:55,682 --> 00:09:00,522
Unfortunately, such emotions
are either fleeting or hidden.

175
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:03,645
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.

176
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,028
So in the last five years,

177
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,948
we have been trying to figure out a way
to reveal these hidden emotions.

178
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,486
Then we made a discovery.

179
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,458
We know that underneath our facial skin,

180
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:17,876
there's a rich network of blood vessels.

181
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,317
When we experience different emotions,

182
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,982
our facial blood flow changes subtly.

183
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:27,561
And these changes are regulated
by the autonomic system

184
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,754
that is beyond our conscious control.

185
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,982
By looking at facial blood flow changes,

186
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,703
we can reveal people's hidden emotions.

187
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:42,007
Unfortunately, such emotion-related
facial blood flow changes

188
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,656
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

189
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:49,400
So to help us reveal
people's facial emotions,

190
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:52,458
we have developed a new imaging technology

191
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:55,631
we call "transdermal optical imaging."

192
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,632
To do so, we use a regular
video camera to record people

193
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:03,742
when they experience
various hidden emotions.

194
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:08,479
And then, using our image
processing technology,

195
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:14,039
we can extract transdermal images
of facial blood flow changes.

196
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:20,747
By looking at transdermal video images,

197
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,558
now we can easily see

198
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:29,368
facial blood flow changes associated
with the various hidden emotions.

199
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:31,732
And using this technology,

200
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:36,424
we can now reveal the hidden emotions
associated with lying,

201
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:39,358
and therefore detect people's lies.

202
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,821
We can do so noninvasively,

203
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:44,384
remotely, inexpensively,

204
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:48,068
with an accuracy at about 85 percent,

205
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,146
which is far better than chance level.

206
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,890
And in addition, we discovered
a Pinocchio effect.

207
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,391
No, not this Pinocchio effect.

208
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,422
(Laughter)

209
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:01,568
This is the real Pinocchio effect.

210
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,009
When people lie,

211
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:06,812
the facial blood flow
on the cheeks decreases,

212
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:10,097
and the facial blood flow
on the nose increases.

213
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,886
Of course, lying is not the only situation

214
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,758
that will evoke our hidden emotions.

215
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:19,656
So then we asked ourselves,

216
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,027
in addition to detecting lies,

217
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,384
how can our technology be used?

218
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:28,573
One application is in education.

219
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:33,258
For example, using this technology,
we can help this mathematics teacher

220
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:36,189
to identify the student in his classroom

221
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:40,958
who may experience high anxiety
about the topic he's teaching

222
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,491
so that he can help him.

223
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:46,077
And also we can use this in health care.

224
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:49,469
For example, every day I Skype my parents,

225
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,575
who live thousands of miles away.

226
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,999
And using this technology,

227
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,505
I can not only find out
what's going on in their lives

228
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:03,831
but also simultaneously monitor
their heart rate, their stress level,

229
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,080
their mood and whether or not
they are experiencing pain.

230
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,649
And perhaps in the future,

231
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:12,962
their risks for heart attack
or hypertension.

232
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:14,961
And you may ask:

233
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:20,953
Can we use this also to reveal
politicians' emotions?

234
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:22,517
(Laughter)

235
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,395
For example, during a debate.

236
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,673
Well, the answer is yes.

237
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,111
Using TV footage,

238
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:33,181
we could detect
the politicians' heart rate,

239
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,251
mood and stress,

240
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:38,853
and perhaps in the future,
whether or not they are lying to us.

241
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:42,491
We can also use this
in marketing research,

242
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,366
for example, to find out

243
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,745
whether or not people like
certain consumer products.

244
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,467
We can even use it in dating.

245
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,064
So for example,

246
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:55,682
if your date is smiling at you,

247
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:58,500
this technology can help you to determine

248
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:01,131
whether she actually likes you

249
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,330
or she is just trying to be nice to you.

250
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,559
And in this case,

251
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,459
she is just trying to be nice to you.

252
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,875
(Laughter)

253
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:14,953
So transdermal optical imaging technology

254
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,555
is at a very early stage of development.

255
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,693
Many new applications will come about
that we don't know today.

256
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,071
However, one thing I know for sure

257
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,509
is that lying will never
be the same again.

258
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,691
Thank you very much.

259
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,039
Xiè xie.

260
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:34,969
(Applause)
