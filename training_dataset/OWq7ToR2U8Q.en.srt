0
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,246
Now, I've been making pictures
for quite a long time,

1
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:17,638
and normally speaking,
a picture like this, for me,

2
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,565
should be straightforward.

3
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:22,421
I'm in southern Ethiopia.
I'm with the Daasanach.

4
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:25,532
There's a big family,
there's a very beautiful tree,

5
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:28,110
and I make these pictures
with this very large,

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,871
extremely cumbersome, very awkward
technical plate film camera.

7
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,331
Does anybody know
4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,

8
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:38,860
and you're setting it up,
putting it on the tripod.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,715
I've got the family, spent the better part
of a day talking with them.

10
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,731
They sort of understand what I'm on about.

11
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,239
They think I'm a bit crazy,
but that's another story.

12
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,609
And what's most important for me
is the beauty and the aesthetic,

13
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,861
and that's based on the light.

14
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,462
So the light's setting
on my left-hand side,

15
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:59,096
and there's a balance
in the communication with the Daasanach,

16
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,640
the family of 30, all ages.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,577
There's babies and there's grandparents,

18
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:05,543
I'm getting them in the tree
and waiting for the light to set,

19
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:08,632
and it's going, going,
and I've got one sheet of film left,

20
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:11,173
and I think, I'm okay,
I'm in control, I'm in control.

21
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:14,745
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
and the light's just about to go,

22
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:17,426
and I want it to be golden,
I want it to be beautiful.

23
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:20,472
I want it to be hanging on the horizon
so it lights these people,

24
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:23,102
in all the potential glory
that they could be presented.

25
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,151
And it's about to go
and it's about to go,

26
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,776
and I put my sheet in the camera,

27
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:27,628
it's all focused,

28
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,913
and all of a sudden
there's a massive "whack,"

29
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,687
and I'm looking around,
and in the top corner of the tree,

30
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,766
one of the girls slaps
the girl next to her,

31
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:38,556
and the girl next to her pulls her hair,
and all hell breaks loose,

32
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,290
and I'm standing there going,
"But the light, the light.

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,580
Wait, I need the light.
Stay still! Stay still!"

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,780
And they start screaming,

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,964
and then one of the men turns around
and starts screaming, shouting,

36
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:51,397
and the whole tree collapses,
not the tree, but the people in the tree.

37
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:55,017
They're all running around screaming,
and they run back off into the village

38
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:58,799
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm
left there standing behind my tripod.

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,146
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,
and I can't make the picture.

40
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:04,170
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,032
It took me a week, it took me a week to
make the picture which you see here today,

42
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:11,071
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)

43
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,734
It's very, very, very simple --
I spent a week going around the village,

44
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,803
and I went to every single one:
"Hello, can you meet at the tree?

45
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,592
What's your story? Who are you?"

46
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:22,837
And it all turned out to be
about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.

47
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:24,920
I mean, I have teenage kids.
I should know.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,593
It was about a boyfriend. The girl
on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,

49
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,231
and they'd started having a fight.

50
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:33,028
And there was a very, very beautiful
lesson for me in that:

51
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,240
If I was going to photograph these people

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,784
in the dignified, respectful way
that I had intended,

53
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:40,297
and put them on a pedestal,
I had to understand them.

54
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,587
It wasn't just about turning up.
It wasn't just about shaking a hand.

55
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:46,642
It wasn't about just saying,
"I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."

56
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,812
I had to get to know
every single one of them,

57
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:52,085
right down to whose boyfriend is who
and who is allowed to kiss who.

58
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,971
So in the end, a week later,

59
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,472
and I was absolutely exhausted,

60
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,243
I mean on my knees going,
"Please get back up in that tree.

61
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,766
It's a picture I need to make."

62
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:02,455
They all came back.
I put them all back up in the tree.

63
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:04,765
I made sure the girls
were in the right position,

64
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,930
and the ones that slapped,
one was over there.

65
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,488
They did look at each other.
If you look at it later,

66
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,952
they're staring
at each other very angrily,

67
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,943
and I've got the tree and everything,

68
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,598
and then at the last minute, I go,
"The goat, the goat!

69
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,307
I need something for the eye to look at.
I need a white goat in the middle."

70
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:22,896
So I swapped all the goats around.
I put the goats in.

71
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:26,507
But even then I got it wrong, because
if you can see on the left-hand side,

72
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,594
another little boy storms off
because I didn't choose his goat.

73
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:32,948
So the moral being I have to learn
to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.

74
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,461
But anyway, the effort
that goes into that picture

75
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,555
and the story that I've
just related to you,

76
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:38,563
as you can imagine,

77
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:41,099
there are hundreds of other
bizarre, eccentric stories

78
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,241
of hundreds of other people
around the world.

79
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,723
And this was about four years ago,
and I set off on a journey,

80
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,744
to be honest, a very indulgent journey.

81
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:53,959
I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist,
perhaps in some ways naive.

82
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,752
But I truly believe that there are people
on the planet that are beautiful.

83
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:00,500
It's very, very simple.
It's not rocket science.

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,512
I wanted to put
these people on a pedestal.

85
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,995
I wanted to put them on a pedestal
like they'd never been seen before.

86
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:10,022
So, I chose about 35 different groups,

87
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:11,901
tribes, indigenous cultures.

88
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,517
They were chosen purely
because of their aesthetic,

89
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,374
and I'll talk more about that later.

90
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:19,950
I'm not an anthropologist, I have
no technical study with the subject,

91
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,852
but I do have a very,
very, very deep passion,

92
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,324
and I believe that I had to choose
the most beautiful people on the planet

93
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:28,910
in the most beautiful
environment that they lived in,

94
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,215
and put the two together
and present them to you.

95
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,289
About a year ago,

96
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,402
I published the first pictures,

97
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:39,419
and something extraordinarily
exciting happened.

98
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,973
The whole world came running,

99
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:44,298
and it was a bizarre experience,
because everybody, from everywhere:

100
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,629
"Who are they? What are they?
How many are they?

101
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,189
Where did you find them?
Are they real? You faked it.

102
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,619
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."
Millions of questions for which,

103
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,743
to be honest, I don't have the answers.

104
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,423
I really didn't have the answers,

105
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:00,246
and I could sort of understand, okay,
they're beautiful, that was my intention,

106
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,313
but the questions that I
was being fired at,

107
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,356
I could not answer them.

108
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,189
Until, it was quite amusing,
about a year ago

109
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,840
somebody said, "You've been
invited to do a TED Talk."

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,464
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?
I haven't met Ted before."

111
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:16,021
He said, "No, a TED Talk."
I said, "But who's Ted?

112
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:19,343
Do I have to talk to him or do we
sit with each other on the stage?"

113
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:22,480
And, "No, no, the TED group.
You must know about it."

114
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,095
And I said, "I've been in a teepee
and in a yurt for the last five years.

115
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,428
How do I know who Ted is?
Introduce me to him."

116
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,767
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."

117
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,666
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!

118
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,140
And then eventually you're going
to go to TEDGlobal.

119
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,274
Even more exciting.

120
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,298
But what you need to do, you need
to teach the people lessons,

121
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,350
lessons that you've learned
on your travels around the world

122
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,280
with these tribes.

123
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,580
I thought, lessons, okay, well,
what did I learn? Good question.

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,886
Three. You need three lessons,
and they need to be terribly profound.

125
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:52,804
(Laughter)

126
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,947
And I thought, three lessons, well,
I'm going to think about it.

127
00:05:55,947 --> 00:06:00,093
(Applause)

128
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:04,540
So I thought long and hard,
and I stood here two days ago,

129
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,505
and I had my test run,
and I had my cards

130
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,449
and my clicker in my hands
and my pictures were on the screen,

131
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,169
and I had my three lessons,
and I started presenting them,

132
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,563
and I had this very odd
out-of-body experience.

133
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,417
I sort of looked at myself
standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,

134
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,233
this is complete loads of codswallop.

135
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,417
All these people sitting here,
they've had more of these talks,

136
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,421
they've heard more lessons in their life.

137
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,573
Who are you to tell them
what you've learned?

138
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:29,216
Who are you to guide them
and who are you to show them

139
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:32,171
what is right, what is wrong,
what these people have to say?"

140
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,452
And I had a little bit of a,
it was very private,

141
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:35,770
a little bit of a meltdown.

142
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,907
I went back, and a little bit like the boy
walking away from the tree with his goats,

143
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:43,158
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,

144
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,433
It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.

145
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:49,035
And I thought long and hard about it,
and I thought, well, the only thing

146
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,888
I can communicate is very, very basic.

147
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,775
You have to turn it all the way around.

148
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:56,153
There's only one person
I know here, and that's me.

149
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:57,895
I'm still getting to know myself,

150
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:01,330
and it's a lifelong journey, and I
probably won't have all the answers,

151
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,440
but I did learn some extraordinary
things on this journey.

152
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,597
So what I'm going to do
is share with you my lessons.

153
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,323
It's a very, as I explained at the
beginning, very indulgent, very personal,

154
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,654
how and why I made these pictures,

155
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:17,889
and I leave it to you as the audience
to interpret what these lessons

156
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,537
have meant to me, what they could
perhaps mean to you.

157
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,092
I traveled enormously as a child.

158
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:27,613
I was very nomadic.
It was actually very exciting.

159
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,424
All around the world,

160
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:33,300
and I had this feeling that I
was pushed off at great speed

161
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,763
to become somebody,
become that individual, Jimmy.

162
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:38,161
Go off into the planet,
and so I ran, and I ran,

163
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:41,671
and my wife sometimes kids me,
"Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"

164
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,008
but I'm, "No, it's all
about something, trust me."

165
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:47,171
So I kept running and I kept running,
and I sort of got somewhere

166
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:50,342
and I sort of stood there and looked
around me and I thought, well,

167
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,201
where do I belong? Where do I fit?

168
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:55,513
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.

169
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,590
So I hope there aren't too many
psychologists in this audience.

170
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,980
Perhaps part of this journey

171
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,103
is about me trying to find out
where I belonged.

172
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:07,200
So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't
when I arrived with these tribes,

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,974
I didn't paint myself yellow and run
around with these spears and loincloths.

174
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:13,900
But what I did find were people
that belonged themselves,

175
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,570
and they inspired me,
some extraordinary people,

176
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,380
and I'd like to introduce you
to some heroes of mine.

177
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,272
They're the Huli.

178
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:25,382
Now, the Huli are some of the most
extraordinarily beautiful people

179
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:26,659
on the planet.

180
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,631
They're proud. They live in
the Papua New Guinean highlands.

181
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:33,730
There's not many of them left,
and they're called the Huli wigmen.

182
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,808
And images like this, I mean,
this is what it's all about for me.

183
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,298
And you've spent weeks and months there
talking with them, getting there,

184
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,547
and I want to put them on a pedestal,
and I said, "You have something

185
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,080
that many people have not seen.

186
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,735
You sit in this stunning nature."

187
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,016
And it really does look like this,
and they really do look like this.

188
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:51,217
This is the real thing.

189
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,271
And you know why they're proud?
You know why they look like this,

190
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,064
and why I broke my back literally

191
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:58,238
to photograph them
and present them to you?

192
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,740
It's because they have
these extraordinary rituals.

193
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,263
And the Huli have this ritual:
When they're teenagers,

194
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,140
becoming a man,
they have to shave their heads,

195
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,262
and they spend the rest of their life
shaving their heads every single day,

196
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:12,226
and what they do with that hair,

197
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,130
they make it into a creation,

198
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,126
a creation that's
a very personal creation.

199
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,379
It's their creation.
It's their Huli creation.

200
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,422
So they're called the Huli wigmen.

201
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,279
That's a wig on his head.

202
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,035
It's all made out of his human hair.

203
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:27,573
And then they decorate that wig with
the feathers of the birds of paradise,

204
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,821
and don't worry,
there are many birds there.

205
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,033
There's very few people living,
so nothing to get too upset about,

206
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,940
and they spend the rest of their life
recreating these hats

207
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,494
and getting further
and further,

208
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,898
and it's extraordinary,
and there's another group,

209
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:42,930
they're called the Kalam,
and they live in the next valley,

210
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,148
but they speak a completely
different language,

211
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:47,620
they look completely different,
and they wear a hat,

212
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,217
and it's built out of scarabs,

213
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:51,530
these fantastic emerald green
little scarabs,

214
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,637
and sometimes there are 5,000
or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,

215
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,680
and they spend the whole of their life
collecting these scarabs

216
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,698
to build these hats.

217
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,622
So the Huli inspired me
in that they belong.

218
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:06,198
Perhaps I have to work harder
at finding a ritual which matters for me

219
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:10,679
and going back into my past
to see where I actually fit.

220
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,349
An extremely important part
of this project

221
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:19,270
was about how I photograph
these extraordinary people.

222
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,660
And it's basically beauty.
I think beauty matters.

223
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,120
We spend the whole of our existence
revolving around beauty:

224
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,788
beautiful places, beautiful things,
and ultimately, beautiful people.

225
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,808
It's very, very, very significant.

226
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:34,595
I've spent all of my life analyzing
what do I look like?

227
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,332
Am I perceived as beautiful?

228
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,705
Does it matter if I'm
a beautiful person or not,

229
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,678
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?

230
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,604
And then when I went off,
I came to a very narrow conclusion.

231
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:47,156
Do I have to go around the world
photographing, excuse me,

232
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:50,954
women between the age of 25 and 30?
Is that what beauty is going to be?

233
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,409
Is everything before and after that
utterly irrelevant?

234
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,653
And it was only until I went on a journey,

235
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,440
a journey that was so extreme,

236
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,048
I still get shivers when I think about it.

237
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:05,197
I went to a part of the world,
and I don't know whether any of you

238
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,402
have ever heard of Chukotka.
Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?

239
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:12,929
Chukotka probably is, technically,
as far as one can go

240
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,691
and still be on the living planet.

241
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,757
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.

242
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:22,605
First you've got to get to Moscow, and
then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.

243
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:25,326
And that's if you get there.

244
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,851
As you can see, some people
sort of miss the runway.

245
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,860
And then when you land there,
in Chukotka are the Chukchis.

246
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,151
Now, the Chukchis are the last
indigenous Inuits of Siberia,

247
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,344
and they're people I'd heard about,
I'd hardly seen any images of,

248
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:38,740
but I knew they were there,

249
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,734
and I'd been in touch with this guide,

250
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,773
and this guide said,

251
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:44,810
"There's this fantastic tribe.
There's only about 40 of them.

252
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,000
You'll be okay. We'll find them."
So off we went on this journey.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,062
When we arrived there, after a month
of traveling across the ice,

254
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:54,386
and we'd got to them, but then
I was not allowed to photograph them.

255
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,955
They said, "You cannot photograph us.
You have to wait.

256
00:11:56,955 --> 00:12:01,138
You have to wait until you get to know us.
You have to wait until you understand us.

257
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,264
You have to wait until you see
how we interact with one another."

258
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:07,202
And only then, it was many,
many weeks later, I saw a respect.

259
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,736
They had zero judgment.

260
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:12,334
They observed one another, from the youth,
from the middle aged to the old.

261
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,600
They need each other.

262
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,630
The children need to chew the meat all day

263
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,779
because the adults don't have any teeth,

264
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,737
but at the same time, the children
take the old aged people out

265
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:23,707
to the toilet because they're infirm,

266
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,992
so there's this fantastic
community of respect.

267
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,750
And they adore and admire one another,
and they truly taught me

268
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,513
what beauty was.

269
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:34,113
(Applause)

270
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:37,061
Now I'm going to ask for a little bit
of audience interaction.

271
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,618
This is extremely important
for the end of my talk.

272
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:42,249
If you could look at somebody
left to the right of you,

273
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,233
and I want you to observe them,

274
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,411
and I want you to give them a compliment.
This is very important.

275
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:51,434
Now, it may be their nose or their hair
or even their aura, I don't mind,

276
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:54,477
but please look at each other,
give them a compliment.

277
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,170
You have to be quick,
because I'm running out of time.

278
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,140
And you have to remember it.

279
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:05,970
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you,
you've given each other compliments.

280
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,546
Hold that compliment very, very tightly.
Hold it for later.

281
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:13,980
And the last thing, it was
extraordinarily profound,

282
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,659
and it happened only two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.

283
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:20,763
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia
on the border of Angola,

284
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:22,690
and I'd been there a few times before,

285
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,039
and I'd gone back
to present this book I'd made,

286
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,960
to show them the pictures,
to get into a discussion with them,

287
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,830
to say, "This is how I saw you.
This is how I love you.

288
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,143
This is how I respect you. What
do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"

289
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:37,216
So I wanted this debate.
It was very, very, very emotional,

290
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,657
and one night we were sitting
around the campfire,

291
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:43,279
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
a little bit too much to drink,

292
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,826
and I was sort of sitting under the stars
going, "This is great,

293
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,450
you've seen my pictures,
we love each other." (Laughter)

294
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,592
And I'm a little bit slow,

295
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,503
and I looked around me, and I said,

296
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:56,805
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.

297
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,900
Wasn't there a fence here
last time I came?

298
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,958
You know, this big
protective fence around the village,

299
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,672
and they sort of looked at me
and go, "Yeah, chief die."

300
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,138
And I thought, okay,
chief dying, right, you know,

301
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,529
look up at the stars again,
look at the campfire.

302
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:13,399
Chief die. What on Earth does
chief die have to do with the fence?

303
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,416
"Chief die.

304
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,854
First we destroy, yeah?
Then we reflect.

305
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:22,708
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."

306
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,656
And I burst out in tears, because
my father had only just died

307
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,490
prior to this journey,

308
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,161
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

309
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,120
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact
that I'm probably standing here today

310
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,233
because of him.

311
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:41,259
These people taught me that we are only
who we are because of our parents

312
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,535
and our grandparents
and our forefathers

313
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:45,346
going on and on and on before that,

314
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:49,432
and I, no matter how romantic
or how idealistic I am on this journey,

315
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:51,789
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

316
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,738
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

317
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:57,519
So what's this all about?

318
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,776
Well, there's an image
I'd like to show you,

319
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:03,505
quite a special image, and it wasn't
essentially the image I wanted to choose.

320
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:07,303
I was sitting there the other day,
and I have to finish on a strong image.

321
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:11,162
And somebody said, "You have to show
them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."

322
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,830
I was like, yeah, but that's not
my favorite picture.

323
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,528
She went, "No no no no no no no.
It's an amazing picture.

324
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:17,581
You're in his eyes."

325
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:21,120
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes?
It's a picture of the Nenets."

326
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,709
She said, "No, look, look closely,
you're in his eyes."

327
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,871
And when you look closely at this picture,
there is a reflection of me in his eyes,

328
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:31,260
so I think perhaps he has my soul,
and I'm in his soul,

329
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,438
and whilst these pictures look at you,
I ask you to look at them.

330
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:37,126
You may not be reflected in his eyes,

331
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:40,502
but there is something extraordinarily
important about these people.

332
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:44,570
I don't ultimately have the answers,
as I've just shared with you,

333
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,818
but you must do.
There must be something there.

334
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:50,440
So if you can briefly reflect
on what I was discussing

335
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,641
about beauty and about belonging
and about our ancestors and our roots,

336
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:59,123
and I need you all
to stand for me, please.

337
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,068
(Laughter)

338
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,368
Now you have no excuse.
It's almost lunchtime,

339
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,902
and this is not a standing ovation,
so don't worry,

340
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,784
I'm not fishing for compliments.

341
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:10,384
But you were given a compliment
a few minutes ago.

342
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,711
Now I want you to stand tall.

343
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,895
I want you to breathe in.
This is what I say.

344
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,236
I'm not going to get
on my knees for two weeks.

345
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:19,324
I'm not going to ask you
to carry a goat,

346
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:21,345
and I know you don't have any camels.

347
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:23,219
Photography's extraordinarily powerful.

348
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,407
It's this language which
we now all understand.

349
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,264
We truly do all understand it,

350
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,749
and we have this global
digital fireplace, don't we,

351
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:31,720
but I want to share you with the world,

352
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,185
because you are also a tribe.

353
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:36,493
You are the TED tribe, yeah?
But you have to remember that compliment.

354
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:39,734
You have to stand tall,
breathe in through your nose,

355
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,702
and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?

356
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,646
I need to do a panoramic shot,
so it's going to take a minute,

357
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,227
so you have to concentrate, okay?

358
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:49,496
Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing.
Shh, breathe through your nose.

359
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,950
I'm going to photograph.

360
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,682
(Clicks)

361
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,536
Thank you.

362
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:05,536
(Applause)
