0
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:15,550
I'd like to have you look at this pencil.

1
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,407
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.

2
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:21,379
And so are books you might have
or the cars you own.

3
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,258
They're all legal things.

4
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,881
The great apes that you'll see behind me,

5
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:31,549
they too are legal things.

6
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:35,822
Now, I can do that to a legal thing.

7
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,631
I can do whatever I want
to my book or my car.

8
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:41,533
These great apes, you'll see.

9
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,420
The photographs are taken by a man
named James Mollison

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,464
who wrote a book called
"James &amp; Other Apes."

11
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,227
And he tells in his book
how every single one them,

12
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,525
almost every one of them, is an orphan

13
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,140
who saw his mother and father
die before his eyes.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,748
They're legal things.

15
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:02,441
So for centuries, there's been
a great legal wall

16
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:05,785
that separates legal things
from legal persons.

17
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:09,570
On one hand, legal things
are invisible to judges.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,520
They don't count in law.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,215
They don't have any legal rights.

20
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:15,699
They don't have
the capacity for legal rights.

21
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,836
They are the slaves.

22
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,660
On the other side of that legal wall
are the legal persons.

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,097
Legal persons are very visible to judges.

24
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,312
They count in law.

25
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,239
They may have many rights.

26
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,142
They have the capacity
for an infinite number of rights.

27
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,510
And they're the masters.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,779
Right now, all nonhuman animals
are legal things.

29
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:40,660
All human beings are legal persons.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,469
But being human and being a legal person

31
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,112
has never been, and is not today,
synonymous with a legal person.

32
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:52,478
Humans and legal persons
are not synonymous.

33
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,358
On the one side,

34
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:59,491
there have been many human beings
over the centuries

35
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,464
who have been legal things.

36
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:02,997
Slaves were legal things.

37
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,719
Women, children,
were sometimes legal things.

38
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,146
Indeed, a great deal of civil rights
struggle over the last centuries

39
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:15,659
has been to punch a hole
through that wall and begin to feed

40
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,713
these human things through the wall
and have them become legal persons.

41
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:24,182
But alas, that hole has closed up.

42
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,819
Now, on the other side are legal persons,

43
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,952
but they've never only been
limited to human beings.

44
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:34,940
There are, for example, there are many
legal persons who are not even alive.

45
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,547
In the United States,

46
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,540
we're aware of the fact
that corporations are legal persons.

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,515
In pre-independence India,

48
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:45,139
a court held that a Hindu idol
was a legal person,

49
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,200
that a mosque was a legal person.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,630
In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,173
held that the holy books
of the Sikh religion was a legal person,

52
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,472
and in 2012, just recently,

53
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:59,233
there was a treaty between
the indigenous peoples of New Zealand

54
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,484
and the crown, in which it was agreed
that a river was a legal person

55
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:05,525
who owned its own riverbed.

56
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:08,776
Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,

57
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:12,500
when I had a full head
of lush, brown hair,

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,088
and indeed I was moved by it,

59
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:18,616
because I had become a lawyer because
I wanted to speak for the voiceless,

60
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,851
defend the defenseless,

61
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:24,263
and I'd never realized how voiceless
and defenseless the trillions,

62
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:27,769
billions of nonhuman animals are.

63
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,788
And I began to work
as an animal protection lawyer.

64
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:35,664
And by 1985, I realized that I was trying
to accomplish something

65
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,591
that was literally impossible,

66
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,215
the reason being that all of my clients,

67
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:43,697
all the animals whose interests
I was trying to defend,

68
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,182
were legal things; they were invisible.

69
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,102
It was not going to work, so I decided

70
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,066
that the only thing that was going to work
was they had, at least some of them,

71
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,864
had to also be moved through a hole
that we could open up again in that wall

72
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:59,440
and begin feeding the appropriate
nonhuman animals through that hole

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,986
onto the other side
of being legal persons.

74
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:08,426
Now, at that time, there was
very little known about or spoken about

75
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,794
truly animal rights,

76
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:15,235
about the idea of having legal personhood
or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,

77
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:18,005
and I knew it was going
to take a long time.

78
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,405
And so, in 1985, I figured that it
would take about 30 years

79
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:24,934
before we'd be able to even begin
a strategic litigation,

80
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:30,716
long-term campaign, in order to be able
to punch another hole through that wall.

81
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:36,556
It turned out that I was pessimistic,
that it only took 28.

82
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:45,240
So what we had to do in order
to begin was not only

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,922
to write law review articles
and teach classes, write books,

84
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,890
but we had to then begin
to get down to the nuts and bolts

85
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,875
of how you litigate that kind of case.

86
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,908
So one of the first things we needed to do
was figure out what a cause of action was,

87
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,367
a legal cause of action.

88
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,264
And a legal cause of action
is a vehicle that lawyers use

89
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:08,840
to put their arguments in front of courts.

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,744
It turns out there's
a very interesting case

91
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,348
that had occurred almost 250 years ago
in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,

92
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,444
whereby a black slave
had used the legal system

93
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,323
and had moved from a legal thing
to a legal person.

94
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:26,386
I was so interested in it that I
eventually wrote an entire book about it.

95
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:31,773
James Somerset was an eight-year-old boy
when he was kidnapped from West Africa.

96
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:34,720
He survived the Middle Passage,

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,894
and he was sold to a Scottish businessman
named Charles Stewart in Virginia.

98
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:44,102
Now, 20 years later, Stewart
brought James Somerset to London,

99
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:47,980
and after he got there, James decided
he was going to escape.

100
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,620
And so one of the first things he did
was to get himself baptized,

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,901
because he wanted to get
a set of godparents,

102
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,712
because to an 18th-century slave,

103
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,870
they knew that one of the major
responsibilities of godfathers

104
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,982
was to help you escape.

105
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:04,998
And so in the fall of 1771,

106
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,641
James Somerset had a confrontation
with Charles Stewart.

107
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:12,313
We don't know exactly what happened,
but then James dropped out of sight.

108
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:15,309
An enraged Charles Stewart
then hired slave catchers

109
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,550
to canvass the city of London,

110
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,150
find him, bring him
not back to Charles Stewart,

111
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,173
but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,
that was floating in London Harbour,

112
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,793
and he was chained to the deck,

113
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,797
and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica

114
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,816
where James was to be sold
in the slave markets

115
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:36,299
and be doomed to the three to five
years of life that a slave had

116
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:39,150
harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.

117
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,359
Well now James' godparents
swung into action.

118
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,866
They approached the most powerful judge,

119
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:48,512
Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge
of the court of King's Bench,

120
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:52,157
and they demanded that he issue
a common law writ of habeus corpus

121
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,991
on behalf of James Somerset.

122
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:57,962
Now, the common law is the kind of law
that English-speaking judges can make

123
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:02,099
when they're not cabined in
by statutes or constitutions,

124
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,695
and a writ of habeus corpus
is called the Great Writ,

125
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,762
capital G, capital W,

126
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:11,290
and it's meant to protect any of us
who are detained against our will.

127
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,263
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.

128
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,701
The detainer is required
to bring the detainee in

129
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:21,576
and give a legally sufficient reason
for depriving him of his bodily liberty.

130
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:26,570
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make
a decision right off the bat,

131
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,354
because if James Somerset
was a legal thing,

132
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:32,419
he was not eligible
for a writ of habeus corpus,

133
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,439
only if he could be a legal person.

134
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,457
So Lord Mansfield decided
that he would assume,

135
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,560
without deciding, that James Somerset
was indeed a legal person,

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,971
and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,
and James's body was brought in

137
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,482
by the captain of the ship.

138
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,183
There were a series of hearings
over the next six months.

139
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:55,011
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield
said that slavery was so odious,

140
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,845
and he used the word "odious,"

141
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:00,723
that the common law would not support it,
and he ordered James free.

142
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:04,313
At that moment, James Somerset
underwent a legal transubstantiation.

143
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,943
The free man who walked
out of the courtroom

144
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,191
looked exactly like the slave
who had walked in,

145
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:14,330
but as far as the law was concerned,
they had nothing whatsoever in common.

146
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,740
The next thing we did is that
the Nonhuman Rights Project,

147
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,250
which I founded, then began to look at
what kind of values and principles

148
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,128
do we want to put before the judges?

149
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,007
What values and principles
did they imbibe with their mother's milk,

150
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,090
were they taught in law school,
do they use every day,

151
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,779
do they believe with all their hearts --
and we chose liberty and equality.

152
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,811
Now, liberty right is the kind of right
to which you're entitled

153
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,152
because of how you're put together,

154
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:45,489
and a fundamental liberty right
protects a fundamental interest.

155
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,724
And the supreme interest in the common law

156
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:52,765
are the rights to autonomy
and self-determination.

157
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,795
So they are so powerful that
in a common law country,

158
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:02,393
if you go to a hospital and you refuse
life-saving medical treatment,

159
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,640
a judge will not order it forced upon you,

160
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,451
because they will respect
your self-determination and your autonomy.

161
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,714
Now, an equality right is the kind
of right to which you're entitled

162
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:15,610
because you resemble someone else
in a relevant way,

163
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,601
and there's the rub, relevant way.

164
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:21,339
So if you are that, then because
they have the right, you're like them,

165
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,684
you're entitled to the right.

166
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:26,306
Now, courts and legislatures
draw lines all the time.

167
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,118
Some are included, some are excluded.

168
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:35,260
But you have to,
at the bare minimum you must --

169
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,695
that line has to be a reasonable means
to a legitimate end.

170
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,435
The Nonhuman Rights Project
argues that drawing a line

171
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:45,742
in order to enslave an autonomous
and self-determining being

172
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:47,530
like you're seeing behind me,

173
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,560
that that's a violation of equality.

174
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,820
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,

175
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,065
it took us seven years,
to find the jurisdiction

176
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,271
where we wanted to begin
filing our first suit.

177
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,770
We chose the state of New York.

178
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,392
Then we decided upon
who our plaintiffs are going to be.

179
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,258
We decided upon chimpanzees,

180
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:07,109
not just because Jane Goodall
was on our board of directors,

181
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,862
but because they, Jane and others,

182
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,582
have studied chimpanzees
intensively for decades.

183
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:17,158
We know the extraordinary
cognitive capabilities that they have,

184
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,292
and they also resemble the kind
that human beings have.

185
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:25,424
And so we chose chimpanzees,
and we began to then canvass the world

186
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,256
to find the experts
in chimpanzee cognition.

187
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:32,761
We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,
Scotland, England and the United States,

188
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,524
and amongst them, they wrote
100 pages of affidavits

189
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:38,320
in which they set out more than 40 ways

190
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
in which their complex
cognitive capability,

191
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,140
either individually or together,

192
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,259
all added up to autonomy
and self-determination.

193
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,936
Now, these included, for example,
that they were conscious.

194
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:53,283
But they're also conscious
that they're conscious.

195
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:56,139
They know they have a mind.
They know that others have minds.

196
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,682
They know they're individuals,
and that they can live.

197
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,975
They understand that they lived yesterday
and they will live tomorrow.

198
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:05,419
They engage in mental time travel.
They remember what happened yesterday.

199
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,870
They can anticipate tomorrow,

200
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,587
which is why it's so terrible to imprison
a chimpanzee, especially alone.

201
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,184
It's the thing that we do
to our worst criminals,

202
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:18,955
and we do that to chimpanzees
without even thinking about it.

203
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,426
They have some kind of moral capacity.

204
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:25,352
When they play economic games
with human beings,

205
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,392
they'll spontaneously make fair offers,
even when they're not required to do so.

206
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:31,425
They are numerate.
They understand numbers.

207
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,805
They can do some simple math.

208
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:36,869
They can engage in language --
or to stay out of the language wars,

209
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:40,234
they're involved in intentional
and referential communication

210
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,721
in which they pay attention
to the attitudes of those

211
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,252
with whom they are speaking.

212
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,710
They have culture.

213
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,501
They have a material culture,
a social culture.

214
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,916
They have a symbolic culture.

215
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,817
Scientists in the Taï Forests
in the Ivory Coast

216
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:58,346
found chimpanzees who were using
these rocks to smash open

217
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:01,132
the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.

218
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,431
It takes a long time
to learn how to do that,

219
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,544
and they excavated the area
and they found

220
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:08,377
that this material culture,
this way of doing it,

221
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,720
these rocks, had passed down
for at least 4,300 years

222
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,712
through 225 chimpanzee generations.

223
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:19,104
So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.

224
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,284
Our chimpanzee,

225
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,187
first we found two of them
in the state of New York.

226
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:28,391
Both of them would die before
we could even get our suits filed.

227
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,272
Then we found Tommy.

228
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:33,384
Tommy is a chimpanzee.
You see him behind me.

229
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,891
Tommy was a chimpanzee.
We found him in that cage.

230
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:39,351
We found him in a small room
that was filled with cages

231
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:44,537
in a larger warehouse structure on a used
trailer lot in central New York.

232
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,711
We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.

233
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:52,353
Kiko was in the back of a cement
storefront in western Massachusetts.

234
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,250
And we found Hercules and Leo.

235
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,953
They're two young male chimpanzees

236
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:59,366
who are being used for biomedical,
anatomical research at Stony Brook.

237
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,671
We found them.

238
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,383
And so on the last week of December 2013,

239
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,323
the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three
suits all across the state of New York

240
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:10,801
using the same common law
writ of habeus corpus argument

241
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,529
that had been used with James Somerset,

242
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,616
and we demanded that the judges issue
these common law writs of habeus corpus.

243
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,727
We wanted the chimpanzees out,

244
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:23,513
and we wanted them brought
to Save the Chimps,

245
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:27,461
a tremendous chimpanzee
sanctuary in South Florida

246
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:32,548
which involves an artificial lake
with 12 or 13 islands --

247
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,411
there are two or three acres
where two dozen chimpanzees live

248
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:36,571
on each of them.

249
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:39,521
And these chimpanzees would then live
the life of a chimpanzee,

250
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:43,923
with other chimpanzees in an environment
that was as close to Africa as possible.

251
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,870
Now, all these cases are still going on.

252
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,902
We have not yet run into
our Lord Mansfield.

253
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,230
We shall. We shall.

254
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,110
This is a long-term strategic
litigation campaign. We shall.

255
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,225
And to quote Winston Churchill,

256
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:04,393
the way we view our cases
is that they're not the end,

257
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,436
they're not even the beginning of the end,

258
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:09,950
but they are perhaps
the end of the beginning.

259
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,497
Thank you.

260
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,497
(Applause)
