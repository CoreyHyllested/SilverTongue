0
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:14,320
For the past decade,

1
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:17,246
I've been studying non-state armed groups:

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,137
armed organizations like terrorists,
insurgents or militias.

3
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,761
I document what these groups do
when they're not shooting.

4
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:28,348
My goal is to better understand
these violent actors

5
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:32,062
and to study ways to encourage transition
from violent engagement

6
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:33,963
to nonviolent confrontation.

7
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:37,391
I work in the field, in the policy world
and in the library.

8
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:42,860
Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,

9
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:44,440
because war has changed.

10
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:46,924
It used to be a contest between states.

11
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:48,719
No longer.

12
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:52,681
It is now a conflict between states
and non-state actors.

13
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,972
For example, of the 216 peace agreements

14
00:00:56,996 --> 00:01:00,406
signed between 1975 and 2011,

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,610
196 of them were between a state
and a non-state actor.

16
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:08,871
So we need to understand these groups;
we need to either engage them

17
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:13,784
or defeat them in any conflict resolution
process that has to be successful.

18
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,222
So how do we do that?

19
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,809
We need to know what makes
these organizations tick.

20
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,941
We know a lot about
how they fight, why they fight,

21
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:25,019
but no one looks at what they're doing
when they're not fighting.

22
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,635
Yet, armed struggle
and unarmed politics are related.

23
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,957
It is all part of the same organization.

24
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:34,138
We cannot understand these groups,
let alone defeat them,

25
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,050
if we don't have the full picture.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,198
And armed groups today
are complex organizations.

27
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:42,125
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,

28
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,932
known for its violent
confrontation against Israel.

29
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:47,791
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

30
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,400
Hezbollah has also set up
a political party,

31
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,741
a social-service network,
and a military apparatus.

32
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,391
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

33
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,982
known for its suicide attacks
against Israel,

34
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:02,210
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

35
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,912
So these groups do way more
than just shoot.

36
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:06,612
They multi-task.

37
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,254
They set up complex
communication machines --

38
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,421
radio stations, TV channels,

39
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,398
Internet websites
and social media strategies.

40
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:17,714
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,

41
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,863
printed in English
and published to recruit.

42
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,166
Armed groups also invest
in complex fund-raising --

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,053
not looting, but setting up
profitable businesses;

44
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,467
for example, construction companies.

45
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:32,374
Now, these activities are keys.

46
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,818
They allow these groups
to increase their strength,

47
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,197
increase their funds,

48
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,093
to better recruit
and to build their brand.

49
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,276
Armed groups also do something else:

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,960
they build stronger bonds
with the population

51
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:46,433
by investing in social services.

52
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,300
They build schools, they run hospitals,

53
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:53,080
they set up vocational-training programs
or micro-loan programs.

54
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:56,881
Hezbollah offers all
of these services and more.

55
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:59,714
Armed groups also seek
to win the population over

56
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:03,638
by offering something
that the state is not providing:

57
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,713
safety and security.

58
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:10,101
The initial rise of the Taliban
in war-torn Afghanistan,

59
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,002
or even the beginning
of the ascent of ISIS,

60
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,084
can be understood also by looking
at these groups' efforts

61
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,324
to provide security.

62
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,619
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

63
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:23,889
the provision of security
came at an unbearably high price

64
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,323
for the population.

65
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:29,588
But in general, providing
social services fills a gap,

66
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,873
a governance gap left by the government,

67
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:34,492
and allows these groups
to increase their strength

68
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:35,714
and their power.

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,446
For example, the 2006 electoral victory
of the Palestinian Hamas

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,049
cannot be understood without
acknowledging the group's social work.

71
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:47,070
Now, this is a really complex picture,

72
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,571
yet in the West,
when we look at armed groups,

73
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,797
we only think of the violent side.

74
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:54,693
But that's not enough to understand
these groups' strength,

75
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,979
strategy or long-term vision.

76
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:58,953
These groups are hybrid.

77
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:02,301
They rise because they fill a gap
left by the government,

78
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,705
and they emerge
to be both armed and political,

79
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,949
engage in violent struggle
and provide governance.

80
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,439
And the more these organizations
are complex and sophisticated,

81
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,804
the less we can think of them
as the opposite of a state.

82
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:19,107
Now, what do you call
a group like Hezbollah?

83
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:22,446
They run part of a territory,
they administer all their functions,

84
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,604
they pick up the garbage,
they run the sewage system.

85
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:28,339
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,057
Or maybe something else,
something different and new?

87
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,762
And what about ISIS?

88
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,056
The lines are blurred.

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,838
We live in a world of states,
non-states, and in-between,

90
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,275
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,

91
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,775
the more non-state actors
step in and fill that gap.

92
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,925
This matters for governments,
because to counter these groups,

93
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,399
they will have to invest more
in non-military tools.

94
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,673
Filling that governance gap

95
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:58,126
has to be at the center
of any sustainable approach.

96
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,789
This also matters very much
for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

97
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,844
If we better understand armed groups,

98
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,330
we will better know
what incentives to offer

99
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:10,130
to encourage the transition
from violence to nonviolence.

100
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:14,131
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,

101
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:16,807
military power can win some battles,

102
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,664
but it will not give us
peace nor stability.

103
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,933
To achieve these objectives,

104
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:26,762
what we need is a long-term investment
in filling that security gap,

105
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,787
in filling that governance gap

106
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,902
that allowed these groups
to thrive in the first place.

107
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,371
Thank you.

108
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,952
(Applause)
