0
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:16,596
People back home call me a heckler,

1
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:19,313
a troublemaker, an irritant,

2
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,983
a rebel, an activist,

3
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:23,840
the voice of the people.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,010
But that wasn't always me.

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,182
Growing up, I had a nickname.

6
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,502
They used to call me Softy,

7
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:33,755
meaning the soft, harmless boy.

8
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:36,495
Like every other human being,
I avoided trouble.

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,538
In my childhood, they taught me silence.

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,340
Don't argue, do as you're told.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,272
In Sunday school, they taught me
don't confront, don't argue,

12
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:47,585
even if you're right,
turn the other cheek.

13
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:52,182
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the time.

14
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,783
(Laughter)

15
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,592
Kenya is a country
where you are guilty

16
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:00,239
until proven rich.

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,984
(Laughter)

18
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:05,726
Kenya's poor are five times more likely

19
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:08,650
to be shot dead by the police
who are meant to protect them

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,298
than by criminals.

21
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,945
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the day.

22
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,894
We had a president,
Moi, who was a dictator.

23
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,100
He ruled the country with an iron fist,

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,538
and anyone who dared
question his authority

25
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:25,507
was arrested, tortured,
jailed or even killed.

26
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,431
That meant that people were taught
to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.

27
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,474
Being a coward was not an insult.

28
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,401
Being a coward was a compliment.

29
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:36,559
We used to be told that a coward
goes home to his mother.

30
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:40,320
What that meant: that if you stayed
out of trouble you're going to stay alive.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,260
I used to question this advice,

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,082
and eight years ago
we had an election in Kenya,

33
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,565
and the results were violently disputed.

34
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:52,302
What followed that election
was terrible violence, rape,

35
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:56,239
and the killing of over 1,000 people.

36
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,360
My work was to document the violence.

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,216
As a photographer,
I took thousands of images,

38
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,283
and after two months,

39
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:09,158
the two politicians came together,
had a cup of tea,

40
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:12,595
signed a peace agreement,
and the country moved on.

41
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:16,124
I was a very disturbed man
because I saw the violence firsthand.

42
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,730
I saw the killings.
I saw the displacement.

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,811
I met women who had been raped,
and it disturbed me,

44
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,855
but the country never spoke about it.

45
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,339
We pretended. We all became smart cowards.

46
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,938
We decided to stay out of trouble
and not talk about it.

47
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:34,235
Ten months later, I quit my job.
I said I could not stand it anymore.

48
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,830
After quitting my job,
I decided to organize my friends

49
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,850
to speak about
the violence in the country,

50
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,714
to speak about the state of the nation,

51
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:44,830
and June 1, 2009 was the day
that we were meant to go to the stadium

52
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,889
and try and get the president's attention.

53
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,329
It's a national holiday,

54
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,978
it's broadcast across the country,

55
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:53,386
and I showed up at the stadium.

56
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,380
My friends did not show up.

57
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,753
I found myself alone,

58
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,280
and I didn't know what to do.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,695
I was scared,

60
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,865
but I knew very well
that that particular day,

61
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,086
I had to make a decision.

62
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,509
Was I able to live as a coward,
like everyone else,

63
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,107
or was I going to make a stand?

64
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,313
And when the president stood up to speak,

65
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:17,920
I found myself on my feet
shouting at the president,

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,114
telling him to remember
the post-election violence victims,

67
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,390
to stop the corruption.

68
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,595
And suddenly, out of nowhere,

69
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:28,707
the police pounced on me
like hungry lions.

70
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,564
They held my mouth

71
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,491
and dragged me out of the stadium,

72
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:35,462
where they thoroughly beat me up
and locked me up in jail.

73
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:43,870
I spent that night in
a cold cement floor in the jail,

74
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,518
and that got me thinking.

75
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,389
What was making me feel this way?

76
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,554
My friends and family thought
I was crazy because of what I did,

77
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:56,568
and the images that I took
were disturbing my life.

78
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,518
The images that I took
were just a number to many Kenyans.

79
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,465
Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

80
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,160
It was a story to them.

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,947
And so I decided to actually
start a street exhibition

82
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,733
to show the images of the violence
across the country

83
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,707
and get people talking about it.

84
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:13,516
We traveled the country
and showed the images,

85
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,999
and this was a journey that has started me
to the activist path,

86
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,716
where I decided to become silent no more,

87
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:21,914
to talk about those things.

88
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:25,564
We traveled, and our general site
from our street exhibit

89
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:30,362
became for political graffiti
about the situation in the country,

90
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:33,120
talking about corruption, bad leadership.

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,900
We have even done symbolic burials.

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,882
We have delivered live pigs
to Kenya's parliament

93
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,810
as a symbol of our politicians' greed.

94
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,041
It has been done in Uganda
and other countries,

95
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,550
and what is most powerful is that
the images have been picked by the media

96
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,586
and amplified across the country,
across the continent.

97
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:54,233
Where I used to stand up alone
seven years ago,

98
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:57,259
now I belong to a community
of many people who stand up with me.

99
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,587
I am no longer alone when I stand up
to speak about these things.

100
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,350
I belong to a group of young people
who are passionate about the country,

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,200
who want to bring about change,

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,614
and they're no longer afraid,
and they're no longer smart cowards.

103
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:16,472
So that was my story.

104
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,840
That day in the stadium,

105
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,327
I stood up as a smart coward.

106
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,574
By that one action, I said goodbye
to the 24 years living as a coward.

107
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,616
There are two most powerful
days in your life:

108
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:36,162
the day you're born,
and the day you discover why.

109
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,015
That day standing up in that stadium
shouting at the President,

110
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:43,295
I discovered why I was truly born,

111
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,546
that I would no longer be silent
in the face of injustice.

112
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:50,580
Do you know why you were born?

113
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,535
Thank you.

114
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,454
(Applause)

115
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:03,031
Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.

116
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,587
I just want to ask you
a couple quick questions.

117
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:07,907
So PAWA254:

118
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:12,220
you've created a studio, a place
where young people can go

119
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,176
and harness the power of digital media

120
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,687
to do some of this action.

121
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:18,564
What's happening now with PAWA?

122
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:21,347
Boniface Mwangi: So we have
this community of filmmakers,

123
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,710
graffiti artists, musicians,
and when there's an issue in the country,

124
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,511
we come together, we brainstorm,
and take up on that issue.

125
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:29,567
So our most powerful tool is art,

126
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,398
because we live in a very busy world
where people are so busy in their life,

127
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:35,465
and they don't have time to read.

128
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:39,598
So we package our activism
and we package our message in art.

129
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,577
So from the music, the graffiti,
the art, that's what we do.

130
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:47,585
Can I say one more thing?

131
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,466
TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)

132
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,101
BM: In spite of being arrested,
beaten up, threatened,

133
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,814
the moment I discovered my voice,

134
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,710
that I could actually stand up
for what I really believed in,

135
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,748
I'm no longer afraid.

136
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,490
I used to be called softy,
but I'm no longer softy,

137
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,891
because I discovered who I really am,
as in, that's what I want to do,

138
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,927
and there's such beauty in doing that.

139
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,316
There's nothing as powerful as that,
knowing that I'm meant to do this,

140
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:13,463
because you don't get scared,
you just continue living your life.

141
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,649
Thank you.

142
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,239
(Applause)
