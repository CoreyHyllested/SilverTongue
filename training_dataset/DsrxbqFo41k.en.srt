0
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,109
There we were,

1
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:18,738
souls and bodies packed
into a Texas church

2
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:21,649
on the last night of our lives.

3
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,699
Packed into a room just like this,

4
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:30,294
but with creaky wooden pews
draped in worn-down red fabric,

5
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,958
with an organ to my left
and a choir at my back

6
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,862
and a baptism pool
built into the wall behind them.

7
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:40,271
A room like this, nonetheless.

8
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:44,060
With the same great feelings of suspense,

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,568
the same deep hopes for salvation,

10
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:50,379
the same sweat in the palms

11
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:53,894
and the same people
in the back not paying attention.

12
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:55,845
(Laughter)

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,416
This was December 31, 1999,

14
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,536
the night of the Second Coming of Christ,

15
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:06,692
and the end of the world as I knew it.

16
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:09,648
I had turned 12 that year

17
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,991
and had reached the age of accountability.

18
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:14,542
And once I stopped complaining

19
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,017
about how unfair it was
that Jesus would return

20
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,530
as soon as I had to be accountable
for all that I had done,

21
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:23,517
I figured I had better get
my house in order very quickly.

22
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:26,391
So I went to church as often as I could.

23
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:31,247
I listened for silence as anxiously
as one might listen for noise,

24
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,361
trying to be sure that the Lord
hadn't pulled a fast one on me

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,960
and decided to come back early.

26
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,304
And just in case he did,

27
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:40,614
I built a backup plan,

28
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:45,158
by reading the "Left Behind" books
that were all the rage at the time.

29
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:47,115
And I found in their pages

30
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,880
that if I was not taken
in the rapture at midnight,

31
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,158
I had another shot.

32
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,005
All I had to do was avoid
taking the mark of the beast,

33
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,920
fight off demons, plagues
and the Antichrist himself.

34
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,131
It would be hard --

35
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:03,324
(Laughter)

36
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,906
but I knew I could do it.

37
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,433
(Laughter)

38
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,245
But planning time was over now.

39
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,085
It was 11:50pm.

40
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:11,271
We had 10 minutes left,

41
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:14,289
and my pastor called us
out of the pews and down to the altar

42
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:18,449
because he wanted to be praying
when midnight struck.

43
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,818
So every faction of the congregation

44
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,145
took its place.

45
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,915
The choir stayed in the choir stand,

46
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,412
the deacons and their wives --

47
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,939
or the Baptist Bourgeoisie
as I like to call them --

48
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:30,249
(Laughter)

49
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:32,480
took first position in front of the altar.

50
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:34,189
You see, in America,

51
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,885
even the Second Coming of Christ
has a VIP section.

52
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,239
(Laughter)

53
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,263
(Applause)

54
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:47,576
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,529
were the elderly --

56
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:54,441
these men and women whose young backs
had been bent under hot suns

57
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,446
in the cotton fields of East Texas,

58
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,853
and whose skin seemed to be burnt
a creaseless noble brown,

59
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:02,551
just like the clay of East Texas,

60
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,604
and whose hopes and dreams
for what life might become

61
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:06,779
outside of East Texas

62
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,446
had sometimes been bent and broken

63
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,969
even further than their backs.

64
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,873
Yes, these men and women
were the stars of the show for me.

65
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,080
They had waited their whole lives
for this moment,

66
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:21,079
just as their medieval predecessors
had longed for the end of the world,

67
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,897
and just as my grandmother
waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show

68
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,166
to come on Channel 8
every day at 4 o'clock.

69
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,191
And as she made her way to the altar,

70
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:32,310
I snuck right in behind her,

71
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,308
because I knew for sure

72
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,408
that my grandmother was going to heaven.

73
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:41,431
And I thought that if I held on
to her hand during this prayer,

74
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:44,155
I might go right on with her.

75
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,301
So I held on

76
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:48,468
and I closed my eyes

77
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,220
to listen,

78
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,828
to wait.

79
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:53,838
And the prayers got louder.

80
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,869
And the shouts of response
to the call of the prayer

81
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,296
went up higher even still.

82
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,126
And the organ rolled on in
to add the dirge.

83
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,343
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.

84
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,976
And my hand gripped firmer,

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,013
so I wouldn't be the one
left in the field.

86
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:08,236
My eyes clenched tighter

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,232
so I wouldn't see the wheat
being separated from the chaff.

88
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,625
And then a voice rang out above us:

89
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,443
"Amen."

90
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,628
It was over.

91
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,346
I looked at the clock.

92
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:23,936
It was after midnight.

93
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,018
I looked at the elder believers

94
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,565
whose savior had not come,

95
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:33,022
who were too proud to show
any signs of disappointment,

96
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,439
who had believed too much and for too long

97
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,585
to start doubting now.

98
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,842
But I was upset on their behalf.

99
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,339
They had been duped,

100
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:45,872
hoodwinked, bamboozled,

101
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,921
and I had gone right along with them.

102
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,030
I had prayed their prayers,

103
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:53,000
I had yielded not to temptation
as best I could.

104
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,444
I had dipped my head not once, but twice

105
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,439
in that snot-inducing baptism pool.

106
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,726
I had believed.

107
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,531
Now what?

108
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:06,821
I got home just in time
to turn on the television

109
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:09,289
and watch Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

110
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:11,002
as it rolled in around the world.

111
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:15,841
It struck me that it would have
been strange anyway,

112
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,245
for Jesus to come back again and again

113
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,905
based on the different time zones.

114
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:25,242
(Laughter)

115
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:29,210
And this made me feel
even more ridiculous --

116
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,555
hurt, really.

117
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,245
But there on that night,
I did not stop believing.

118
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,781
I just believed a new thing:

119
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,919
that it was possible not to believe.

120
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,306
It was possible the answers
I had were wrong,

121
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,677
that the questions themselves were wrong.

122
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,263
And now, where there was once
a mountain of certitude,

123
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:54,583
there was, running right down
to its foundation,

124
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,721
a spring of doubt,

125
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,461
a spring that promised rivers.

126
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:03,490
I can trace the whole drama of my life

127
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,140
back to that night in that church

128
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,246
when my savior did not come for me;

129
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,591
when the thing I believed most certainly

130
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,325
turned out to be, if not a lie,

131
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,461
then not quite the truth.

132
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:20,150
And even though most of you
prepared for Y2K in a very different way,

133
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:23,322
I'm convinced that you are here

134
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:27,254
because some part of you has done
the same thing that I have done

135
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,301
since the dawn of this new century,

136
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,460
since my mother left
and my father stayed away

137
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,165
and my Lord refused to come.

138
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,354
And I held out my hand,

139
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:39,330
reaching for something to believe in.

140
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:43,479
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,

141
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,832
with the faith that my journey
from Oak Cliff, Texas

142
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:50,545
was a chance to leave behind
all the challenges I had known,

143
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,400
the broken dreams
and broken bodies I had seen.

144
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:58,079
But when I found myself back home
one winter break,

145
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,208
with my face planted in the floor,

146
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,603
my hands tied behind my back

147
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,512
and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,

148
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:11,379
I knew that even the best education
couldn't save me.

149
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,293
I held on when I showed up
at Lehman Brothers

150
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,331
as an intern in 2008.

151
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:23,715
(Laughter)

152
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,054
So hopeful --

153
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,340
(Laughter)

154
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,383
that I called home to inform my family

155
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:31,957
that we'd never be poor again.

156
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,071
(Laughter)

157
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,801
But as I witnessed this temple of finance

158
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,640
come crashing down before my eyes,

159
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:41,940
I knew that even the best job
couldn't save me.

160
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,452
I held on when I showed up
in Washington DC as a young staffer,

161
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,701
who had heard a voice
call out from Illinois,

162
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,853
saying, "It's been a long time coming,

163
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:57,372
but in this election, change
has come to America."

164
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,291
But as the Congress ground to a halt

165
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,033
and the country ripped at the seams

166
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,490
and hope and change
began to feel like a cruel joke,

167
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,821
I knew that even
the political second coming

168
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,068
could not save me.

169
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,316
I had knelt faithfully at the altar
of the American Dream,

170
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,518
praying to the gods of my time

171
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,411
of success,

172
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,984
and money,

173
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:21,508
and power.

174
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,037
But over and over again,

175
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,662
midnight struck, and I opened my eyes

176
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,154
to see that all of these gods were dead.

177
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,828
And from that graveyard,

178
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,297
I began the search once more,

179
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,591
not because I was brave,

180
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,020
but because I knew
that I would either believe

181
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:40,271
or I would die.

182
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:43,754
So I took a pilgrimage
to yet another mecca,

183
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:45,755
Harvard Business School --

184
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,283
(Laughter)

185
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:52,192
this time, knowing that I could not
simply accept the salvation

186
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,446
that it claimed to offer.

187
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,065
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.

188
00:08:56,981 --> 00:09:01,276
The work began in the dark corner
of a crowded party,

189
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:05,552
in the late night of an early,
miserable Cambridge winter,

190
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:08,493
when three friends and I asked a question

191
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,167
that young folks searching
for something real have asked

192
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,958
for a very long time:

193
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,656
"What if we took a road trip?"

194
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,724
(Laughter)

195
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,729
We didn't know where'd we go
or how we'd get there,

196
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,514
but we knew we had to do it.

197
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,124
Because all our lives we yearned,
as Jack Kerouac wrote,

198
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,100
to "sneak out into the night
and disappear somewhere,"

199
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,044
and go find out what everybody was doing

200
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,340
all over the country.

201
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,519
So even though there were
other voices who said

202
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,996
that the risk was too great
and the proof too thin,

203
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,376
we went on anyhow.

204
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:47,626
We went on 8,000 miles across America
in the summer of 2013,

205
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,798
through the cow pastures of Montana,
through the desolation of Detroit,

206
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,445
through the swamps of New Orleans,

207
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:56,071
where we found and worked
with men and women

208
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,780
who were building small businesses

209
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,749
that made purpose their bottom line.

210
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,648
And having been trained
at the West Point of capitalism,

211
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,776
this struck us as a revolutionary idea.

212
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,816
(Laughter)

213
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,824
And this idea spread,

214
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:14,150
growing into a nonprofit
called MBAs Across America,

215
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,229
a movement that landed me here
on this stage today.

216
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,797
It spread because we found
a great hunger in our generation

217
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,264
for purpose, for meaning.

218
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:30,015
It spread because we found
countless entrepreneurs

219
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,947
in the nooks and crannies of America

220
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,424
who were creating jobs and changing lives

221
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,977
and who needed a little help.

222
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,368
But if I'm being honest, it also spread

223
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,094
because I fought to spread it.

224
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:45,447
There was no length
to which I would not go

225
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:46,627
to preach this gospel,

226
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,487
to get more people to believe

227
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,910
that we could bind the wounds
of a broken country,

228
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,091
one social business at a time.

229
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:58,289
But it was this journey of evangelism

230
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,497
that led me to the rather different gospel

231
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,772
that I've come to share with you today.

232
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:09,079
It began one evening almost a year ago

233
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,393
at the Museum of Natural History
in New York City,

234
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:17,123
at a gala for alumni
of Harvard Business School.

235
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,876
Under a full-size replica of a whale,

236
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,924
I sat with the titans of our time

237
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,669
as they celebrated their peers
and their good deeds.

238
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,011
There was pride in a room

239
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,914
where net worth
and assets under management

240
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,317
surpassed half a trillion dollars.

241
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,203
We looked over all that we had made,

242
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,028
and it was good.

243
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,914
(Laughter)

244
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,296
But it just so happened,

245
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,145
two days later,

246
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,693
I had to travel up the road to Harlem,

247
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,894
where I found myself
sitting in an urban farm

248
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,703
that had once been a vacant lot,

249
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,316
listening to a man named Tony
tell me of the kids

250
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,898
that showed up there every day.

251
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:03,267
All of them lived below the poverty line.

252
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:07,495
Many of them carried
all of their belongings in a backpack

253
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,704
to avoid losing them
in a homeless shelter.

254
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:13,680
Some of them came to Tony's program,

255
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:15,051
called Harlem Grown,

256
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:18,024
to get the only meal they had each day.

257
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:24,080
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown
with money from his pension,

258
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,207
after 20 years as a cab driver.

259
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,551
He told me that he didn't give
himself a salary,

260
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:35,184
because despite success,
the program struggled for resources.

261
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:38,100
He told me that he would take any help

262
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:39,822
that he could get.

263
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,136
And I was there as that help.

264
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:49,158
But as I left Tony,
I felt the sting and salt of tears

265
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:51,375
welling up in my eyes.

266
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,474
I felt the weight of revelation

267
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,319
that I could sit in one room on one night,

268
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:03,308
where a few hundred people
had half a trillion dollars,

269
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:06,248
and another room, two days later,

270
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,117
just 50 blocks up the road,

271
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,215
where a man was going without a salary

272
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,791
to get a child her only meal of the day.

273
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,417
And it wasn't the glaring inequality
that made me want to cry,

274
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,252
it wasn't the thought of hungry,
homeless kids,

275
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,112
it wasn't rage toward the one percent

276
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:27,414
or pity toward the 99.

277
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:31,572
No, I was disturbed
because I had finally realized

278
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,599
that I was the dialysis

279
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:37,820
for a country that needed
a kidney transplant.

280
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:42,316
I realized that my story
stood in for all those

281
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,182
who were expected to pick
themselves up by their bootstraps,

282
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,352
even if they didn't have any boots;

283
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:49,855
that my organization stood in

284
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,629
for all the structural, systemic help
that never went to Harlem

285
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,598
or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;

286
00:13:55,622 --> 00:14:00,401
that my voice stood in
for all those voices

287
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:06,241
that seemed too unlearned,
too unwashed, too unaccommodated.

288
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:08,538
And the shame of that,

289
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,108
that shame washed over me

290
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,993
like the shame of sitting
in front of the television,

291
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:17,397
watching Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

292
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,629
again

293
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:19,803
and again

294
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,407
and again.

295
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:22,946
I had been duped,

296
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,234
hoodwinked,

297
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:26,846
bamboozled.

298
00:14:27,403 --> 00:14:30,477
But this time, the false savior was me.

299
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,302
You see, I've come a long way
from that altar

300
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,422
on the night I thought
the world would end,

301
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:40,576
from a world where people spoke in tongues

302
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:43,745
and saw suffering
as a necessary act of God

303
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,290
and took a text to be infallible truth.

304
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,839
Yes, I've come so far

305
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,143
that I'm right back where I started.

306
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,318
Because it simply is not true to say

307
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,223
that we live in an age of disbelief --

308
00:14:56,247 --> 00:15:00,563
no, we believe today just as much
as any time that came before.

309
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,252
Some of us may believe
in the prophecy of Brené Brown

310
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,452
or Tony Robbins.

311
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:08,103
We may believe in the bible
of The New Yorker

312
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,737
or the Harvard Business Review.

313
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,725
We may believe most deeply

314
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,752
when we worship right here
at the church of TED,

315
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,528
but we desperately want to believe,

316
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,098
we need to believe.

317
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,186
We speak in the tongues
of charismatic leaders

318
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,402
that promise to solve all our problems.

319
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:28,506
We see suffering as a necessary act
of the capitalism that is our god,

320
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,762
we take the text of technological progress

321
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,233
to be infallible truth.

322
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,650
And we hardly realize
the human price we pay

323
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,762
when we fail to question one brick,

324
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,641
because we fear it might shake
our whole foundation.

325
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,278
But if you are disturbed

326
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,210
by the unconscionable things
that we have come to accept,

327
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:54,683
then it must be questioning time.

328
00:15:55,987 --> 00:16:00,034
So I have not a gospel
of disruption or innovation

329
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,508
or a triple bottom line.

330
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,985
I do not have a gospel of faith
to share with you today, in fact.

331
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,967
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,020
The gospel of doubt does not ask
that you stop believing,

333
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:17,657
it asks that you believe a new thing:

334
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,737
that it is possible not to believe.

335
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,682
It is possible the answers
we have are wrong,

336
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:26,289
it is possible the questions
themselves are wrong.

337
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:30,135
Yes, the gospel of doubt means
that it is possible that we,

338
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,745
on this stage, in this room,

339
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:34,335
are wrong.

340
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,044
Because it raises the question, "Why?"

341
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,964
With all the power
that we hold in our hands,

342
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:44,368
why are people still suffering so bad?

343
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,764
This doubt leads me to share
that we are putting my organization,

344
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,054
MBAs Across America,

345
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,706
out of business.

346
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,222
We have shed our staff
and closed our doors

347
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,274
and we will share our model freely

348
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,184
with anyone who sees
their power to do this work

349
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,056
without waiting for our permission.

350
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,755
This doubt compels me

351
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,009
to renounce the role of savior

352
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,428
that some have placed on me,

353
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,996
because our time is too short
and our odds are too long

354
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,800
to wait for second comings,

355
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,308
when the truth is that
there will be no miracles here.

356
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,049
And this doubt, it fuels me,

357
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,028
it gives me hope

358
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,856
that when our troubles overwhelm us,

359
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,879
when the paths laid out for us
seem to lead to our demise,

360
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,556
when our healers bring
no comfort to our wounds,

361
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,617
it will not be our blind faith --

362
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,810
no, it will be our humble doubt

363
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,041
that shines a little light
into the darkness of our lives

364
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,298
and of our world

365
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,039
and lets us raise our voice to whisper

366
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,983
or to shout

367
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,152
or to say simply,

368
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:53,326
very simply,

369
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,222
"There must be another way."

370
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:58,162
Thank you.

371
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:18,408
(Applause)
