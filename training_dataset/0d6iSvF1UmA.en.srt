00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,040
Good evening.

1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,576
My journey to this stage

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,216
began when I came to America

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,080
at the age of 17.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,656
You see, I'm one
of the 84 million Americans

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,976
who are immigrants

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,416
or children of immigrants.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,256
Each of us has a dream when we come here,

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,296
a dream that usually has to be rewritten

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,640
and always has to be repurposed.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,456
I was one of the lucky ones.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,296
My revised dream
led me to the work I do today:

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,256
training immigrants
to run for public office

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,440
and leading a movement
for inclusive democracy.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,456
But I don't want you to think
it was a cakewalk,

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,760
that America opened its arms wide
and welcomed me.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,840
It's still not doing that.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,256
And I've learned
a few lessons along the way

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,896
that I wanted to share with you,

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,896
because I think that together

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,616
we can make American democracy

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,280
better and stronger.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,976
I was born in India,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,976
the world's largest democracy,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,256
and when I was four,

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,096
my family moved to Belize,

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,560
the world's smallest democracy perhaps.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,136
And at the age of 17,

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,016
I moved to the United States,

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
the world's greatest democracy.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
I came because I wanted
to study English literature.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,936
You see, as a child,
I buried my nose in books,

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,616
and I thought, why not make a living
doing that as an adult?

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,096
But after I graduated from college

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,256
and got a graduate degree,

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,800
I found myself moving
from one less ideal job to another.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,016
Maybe it was the optimism
that I had about America

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,936
that made me take a while to understand

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,216
that things were not going to change.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,136
The door that I thought was open

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,056
was actually just slightly ajar --

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,016
this door of America

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,136
that would open wide
if you had the right name,

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,776
the right skin color,

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,656
the right networks,

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,416
but could just slam in your face

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,536
if you had the wrong religion,

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
the wrong immigration status,

48
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,920
the wrong skin color.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,456
And I just couldn't accept that.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,400
So I started a career
as a social entrepreneur,

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,496
starting an organization
for young people like myself --

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,640
I was young at the time
that I started it --

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
who traced their heritage
to the Indian subcontinent.

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,840
In that work, I became and advocate
for South Asians and other immigrants.

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,600
I lobbied members of Congress
on policy issues.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,920
I volunteered on election day
to do exit polling.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,800
But I couldn't vote,
and I couldn't run for office.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,816
So in 2000, when it was announced

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,656
that the citizenship application fee
was going to more than double

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,376
from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,560
I decided it was time to apply
before I could no longer afford it.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,536
I filled out a long application,

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,880
answering questions about
my current and my past affiliations.

64
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,576
And once the application was submitted,

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,856
there were fingerprints to be taken,

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,056
a test to study for,

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,680
endless hours of waiting in line.

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You might call it extreme vetting.

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,016
And then in December of 2000,

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,016
I joined hundreds of other immigrants

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,176
in a hall in Brooklyn

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,536
where we pledged our loyalty

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,216
to a country that we had
long considered home.

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,856
My journey from international student
to American citizen took 16 years,

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,200
a short timeline when you compare it
to other immigrant stories.

76
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,176
And soon after I had taken
that formal step

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,136
to becoming an American,

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,016
the attacks of September 11, 2001,

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,200
changed the immigration landscape
for decades to come.

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,816
My city, New York City,

81
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,216
was reeling and healing,

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,616
and in the midst of it,

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
we were in an election cycle.

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,896
Two things happened

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,600
as we coped with loss and recovery
in New York City.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg
mayor of New York City.

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,776
We also adopted by ballot referendum

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
the Office of Immigrant Affairs
for the City of New York.

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Five months after that election,

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
the newly elected mayor

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,896
appointed me the first Commissioner
of Immigrant Affairs

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,200
for this newly established office.

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,320
I want you to come back to that time.

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,800
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,296
I had basically floundered
in various jobs in America

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,856
before I started
a community-based organization

97
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,080
in a church basement in Queens.

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,360
The attacks of September 11
sent shock waves through my community.

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,296
People who were members of my family,
young people I had worked with,

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,136
were experiencing harassment

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
at schools, at workplaces
and in airports.

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,200
And now I was going
to represent their concerns

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
in government.

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,480
No job felt more perfect for me.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,600
And here are two things I learned
when I became Commissioner.

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,056
First, well-meaning New Yorkers

107
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,216
who were in city government
holding government positions

108
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,720
had no idea how scared immigrants were

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
of law enforcement.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,056
Most of us don't really know
the difference, do we,

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,440
between a sheriff
and local police and the FBI.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,896
And most of us,
when we see someone in uniform

113
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,816
going through our neighborhoods

114
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,240
feel curiosity, if not concern.

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,016
So if you're an undocumented parent,

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,056
every day when you say
goodbye to your child,

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,816
send them off to school and go to work,

118
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,816
you don't know what the chances are

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,416
that you're going to see them
at the end of the day.

120
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,760
Because a raid at your workplace,

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,136
a chance encounter with local police

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,840
could change the course
of your life forever.

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,216
The second thing I learned
is that when people like me,

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,800
who understood that fear,

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,816
who had learned a new language,
who had navigated new systems,

126
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,176
when people like us
were sitting at the table,

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,320
we advocated for our communities' needs
in a way that no one else could or would.

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,440
I understood what that feeling
of fear was like.

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,376
People in my family were experiencing it.

130
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,816
Young people I had worked with
were being harassed,

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,816
not just by classmates,

132
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,600
but also by their teachers.

133
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,336
My husband, then boyfriend,

134
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,576
thought twice before he put
a backpack on or grew a beard

135
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
because he traveled so much.

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,256
What I learned in 2001
was that my vote mattered

137
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,560
but that my voice
and vantage point also mattered.

138
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,336
And it's these three things --

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,496
immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points --

140
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,480
that I think can help
make our democracy stronger.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,056
We actually have the power

142
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,056
to change the outcome of elections,

143
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,216
to introduce new issues
into the policy debate

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,136
and to change the face
of the pale, male, stale leadership

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
that we have in our country today.

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,176
So how do we do that?

147
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,776
Well, let's talk first about votes.

148
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,456
It will come as no surprise to you

149
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,240
that the majority of voters
in America are white.

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,936
But it might surprise you to know

151
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,000
that one in three voters
are black, Latino or Asian.

152
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,376
But here's the thing:

153
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,680
it doesn't just matter who can vote,
it matters who does vote.

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,856
So in 2012, half of the Latino
and Asian-American voters

155
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,120
did not vote.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,696
And these votes matter
not just in presidential elections.

157
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
They matter in local and state elections.

158
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,456
In 2015, Lan Diep,

159
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,800
the eldest son of political
refugees from Vietnam,

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,320
ran for a seat
in the San Jose City Council.

161
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,640
He lost that election by 13 votes.

162
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,856
This year, he dusted off
those campaign shoes

163
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,720
and went back to run for that seat,

164
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,480
and this time he won, by 12 votes.

165
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,920
Every one of our votes matters.

166
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,816
And when people like Lan
are sitting at the policy table,

167
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,176
they can make a difference.

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,976
We need those voices.

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,256
We need those voices

170
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,376
in part because American leadership

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,240
does not look like America's residents.

172
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,880
There are over 500,000
local and state offices in America.

173
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,136
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices
are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,920
the two largest immigrant groups
in our country.

175
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,936
In the city of Yakima, Washington,

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,576
where 49 percent
of the population is Latino,

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,160
there has never been a Latino
on the city council until this year.

178
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,496
Three newly elected Latinas
joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.

179
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,216
One of them is Carmen Méndez.

180
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,976
She is a first-generation college student.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,816
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,

182
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,256
and partly in Yakima, Washington.

183
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,720
She's a single mother,
a community advocate.

184
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,016
Her voice on the Yakima City Council

185
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,616
is advocating on behalf
of the Latino community

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,896
and of all Yakima residents.

187
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,496
And she's a role model for her daughter

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,800
and other Latinas.

189
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,960
But the third most untapped resource
in American democracy

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,280
is the vantage point
that immigrants bring.

191
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,240
We have fought to be here.

192
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,416
We have come for economic
and educational opportunity.

193
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,776
We have come for political
and religious freedom.

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,960
We have come in the pursuit of love.

195
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,016
That dedication,

196
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,840
that commitment to America

197
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,320
we also bring to public service.

198
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,656
People like Athena Salman,

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,176
who just last week won the primary

200
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,576
for a seat in the Arizona State House.

201
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,696
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank

202
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,936
and moved to Chicago,

203
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,416
where he met her mother.

204
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,496
Her mother is part Italian,

205
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,936
part Mexican and part German.

206
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,600
Together they moved to Arizona
and built a life.

207
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,936
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,

208
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,496
is going to fight for things
like education funding

209
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,056
that will help give
families like hers a leg up

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,096
so they can achieve
the financial stability

211
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
that we all are looking for.

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,376
Immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points

213
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,296
are what we all need to work
to include in American democracy.

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,920
It's not just my work. It's also yours.

215
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,496
And it's not going to be easy.

216
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,176
We never know

217
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,400
what putting a new factor
into an equation will do.

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,760
And it's a little scary.

219
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,696
You're scared that I'm going
to take away your place at the table,

220
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,200
and I'm scared that I'm never
going to get a place at the table.

221
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,616
And we're all scared

222
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,720
that we're going to lose this country
that we know and love.

223
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,696
I'm scared you're going
to take it away from me,

224
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,200
and you're scared
I'm going to take it away from you.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,576
Look, it's been a rough election year,

226
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,976
a reminder that people
with my immigration history

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
could be removed at the whim of a leader.

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,736
But I have fought to be in this country

229
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,696
and I continue to do so every day.

230
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,816
So my optimism never wavers,

231
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,376
because I know that there are
millions of immigrants just like me,

232
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,360
in front of me,
behind me and all around me.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
It's our country, too.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,136
Thank you.

235
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,760
(Applause)
