0
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:15,452
There's this fact that I love
that I read somewhere once,

1
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:20,126
that one of the things that's contributed
to homo sapiens' success

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,493
as a species

3
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,573
is our lack of body hair --

4
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:26,021
that our hairlessness, our nakedness

5
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,351
combined with our invention of clothing,

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,669
gives us the ability to modulate
our body temperature

7
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:35,289
and thus be able to survive
in any climate we choose.

8
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:39,322
And now we've evolved to the point
where we can't survive without clothing.

9
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,876
And it's more than just utility,

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,221
now it's a communication.

11
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:45,053
Everything that we choose
to put on is a narrative,

12
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:47,098
a story about where we've been,

13
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,714
what we're doing,

14
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:49,938
who we want to be.

15
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,796
I was a lonely kid.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,652
I didn't have an easy time
finding friends to play with,

17
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:58,071
and I ended up making
a lot of my own play.

18
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:00,902
I made a lot of my own toys.

19
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,565
It began with ice cream.

20
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:05,713
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,

21
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:08,089
and they served ice cream
from behind the counter

22
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:10,720
in these giant, five-gallon,
cardboard tubs.

23
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:13,006
And someone told me --
I was eight years old --

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,730
someone told me that when
they were done with those tubs,

25
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,968
they washed them out
and kept them in the back,

26
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,946
and if you asked they would give you one.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,404
It took me a couple of weeks
to work up the courage,

28
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,579
but I did, and they did.

29
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:26,916
They gave me one -- I went home
with this beautiful cardboard tub.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,336
I was trying to figure out what
I could do with this exotic material --

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,745
metal ring, top and bottom.

32
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,154
I started turning it over in my head,
and I realized, "Wait a minute --

33
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,320
my head actually fits inside this thing."

34
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,907
(Laughter)

35
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,624
Yeah, I cut a hole out,

36
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:42,167
I put some acetate in there

37
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,905
and I made myself a space helmet.

38
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,082
(Laughter)

39
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,066
I needed a place to wear the space helmet,

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,794
so I found a refrigerator box
a couple blocks from home.

41
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,105
I pushed it home,

42
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,897
and in my parents' guest room closet,

43
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:57,312
I turned it into a spaceship.

44
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,635
I started with a control panel
out of cardboard.

45
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,457
I cut a hole for a radar screen

46
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,704
and put a flashlight
underneath it to light it.

47
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:06,778
I put a view screen up,
which I offset off the back wall --

48
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,435
and this is where I thought
I was being really clever --

49
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,506
without permission, I painted
the back wall of the closet black

50
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,689
and put a star field,

51
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:18,243
which I lit up with some Christmas lights
I found in the attic,

52
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,204
and I went on some space missions.

53
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:22,365
A couple years later,

54
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,791
the movie "Jaws" came out.

55
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:27,061
I was way too young to see it,
but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,

56
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,247
like everyone else in America at the time.

57
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,161
There was a store in my town
that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,

58
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,753
and my mom must have overheard
me talking to someone

59
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,897
about how awesome
I thought this costume was,

60
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,779
because a couple days before Halloween,

61
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:43,938
she blew my freaking mind
by giving me this "Jaws" costume.

62
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,765
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope

63
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,662
for people of a certain age to complain

64
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:52,222
that kids these days have no idea
how good they have it,

65
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,291
but let me just show you a random sampling

66
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:58,013
of entry-level kids' costumes
you can buy online right now ...

67
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:01,859
... and this is the "Jaws" costume
my mom bought for me.

68
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:04,615
(Laughter)

69
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,890
This is a paper-thin shark face

70
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:11,452
and a vinyl bib with the poster
of "Jaws" on it.

71
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,524
(Laughter)

72
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:13,951
And I loved it.

73
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,802
A couple years later,

74
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:18,643
my dad took me to a film
called "Excalibur."

75
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,709
I actually got him to take me to it twice,

76
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:25,000
which is no small thing,
because it is a hard, R-rated film.

77
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,180
But it wasn't the blood
and guts or the boobs

78
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,101
that made me want to go see it again.

79
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,283
They helped --

80
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,309
(Laughter)

81
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,498
It was the armor.

82
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:36,636
The armor in "Excalibur"
was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,277
These were literally knights
in shining, mirror-polished armor.

84
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:45,478
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"
wear their armor everywhere.

85
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:49,025
All the time -- they wear it at dinner,
they wear it to bed.

86
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,100
(Laughter)

87
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:51,994
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?

88
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,486
I want to wear armor all the time!"

89
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,525
(Laughter)

90
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,748
So I went back to my favorite material,

91
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,321
the gateway drug for making,

92
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,765
corrugated cardboard,

93
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:03,651
and I made myself a suit of armor,

94
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:07,120
replete with the neck shields
and a white horse.

95
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,410
Now that I've oversold it,

96
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,460
here's a picture of the armor that I made.

97
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,825
(Laughter)

98
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,299
(Applause)

99
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,327
Now, this is only the first
suit of armor I made

100
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,695
inspired by "Excalibur."

101
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,972
A couple of years later,

102
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:26,094
I convinced my dad to embark
on making me a proper suit of armor.

103
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:27,763
Over about a month,

104
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:32,081
he graduated me from cardboard
to roofing aluminum called flashing

105
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,921
and still, one of my all-time favorite
attachment materials,

106
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:36,112
POP rivets.

107
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:37,848
We carefully, over that month,

108
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:40,446
constructed an articulated suit
of aluminum armor

109
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,631
with compound curves.

110
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,560
We drilled holes in the helmet
so that I could breathe,

111
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,631
and I finished just in time
for Halloween and wore it to school.

112
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,809
Now, this is the one thing in this talk

113
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,650
that I don't have a slide to show you,

114
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,676
because no photo exists of this armor.

115
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,063
I did wear it to school,

116
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,691
there was a yearbook photographer
patrolling the halls,

117
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:01,105
but he never found me, for reasons
that are about to become clear.

118
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,207
There were things I didn't anticipate

119
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:07,602
about wearing a complete suit
of aluminum armor to school.

120
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,822
In third period math,
I was standing in the back of class,

121
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,647
and I'm standing in the back of class

122
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,867
because the armor did not
allow me to sit down.

123
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,346
(Laughter)

124
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,820
This is the first thing
I didn't anticipate.

125
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,866
And then my teacher looks at me
sort of concerned

126
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,882
about halfway through the class
and says, "Are you feeling OK?"

127
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,152
I'm thinking, "Are you kidding?
Am I feeling OK?

128
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,044
I'm wearing a suit of armor!
I am having the time of my --"

129
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,728
And I'm just about to tell her
how great I feel,

130
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:35,145
when the classroom
starts to list to the left

131
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,886
and disappear down this long tunnel,

132
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,482
and then I woke up in the nurse's office.

133
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,269
I had passed out from heat exhaustion,

134
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,719
wearing the armor.

135
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:47,894
And when I woke up,

136
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,063
I wasn't embarrassed about having
passed out in front of my class,

137
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,686
I was wondering, "Who took my armor?
Where's my armor?"

138
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,900
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,

139
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:59,258
some colleagues and I get hired
to make a show for Discovery Channel,

140
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:00,433
called "MythBusters."

141
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:01,623
And over 14 years,

142
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:04,821
I learn on the job how to build
experimental methodologies

143
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,424
and how to tell stories
about them for television.

144
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,499
I also learn early on

145
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:12,382
that costuming can play a key role
in this storytelling.

146
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:16,441
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color

147
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:19,488
and narrative clarity
to the stories we're telling.

148
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,694
And then we do an episode
called "Dumpster Diving,"

149
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,985
and I learn a little bit more

150
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,440
about the deeper implications
of what costuming means to me.

151
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,060
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"

152
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,039
the question we were trying to answer is:

153
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,706
Is jumping into a dumpster as safe

154
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,706
as the movies would lead you to believe?

155
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,504
(Laughter)

156
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,163
The episode was going to have
two distinct parts to it.

157
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:43,242
One was where we get trained
to jump off buildings by a stuntman

158
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,599
into an air bag.

159
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:47,104
And the second was the graduation
to the experiment:

160
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,973
we'd fill a dumpster full of material
and we'd jump into it.

161
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,284
I wanted to visually separate
these two elements,

162
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,465
and I thought,

163
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:57,173
"Well, for the first part we're training,
so we should wear sweatsuits --

164
00:06:57,197 --> 00:07:00,945
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'
on the back of the sweatsuits.

165
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,313
That's for the training."

166
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:05,702
But for the second part, I wanted
something really visually striking --

167
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,204
"I know! I'll dress as Neo
from 'The Matrix.'"

168
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,302
(Laughter)

169
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,636
So I went to Haight Street.

170
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,239
I bought some beautiful
knee-high, buckle boots.

171
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,705
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.

172
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,450
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear
contact lenses in order to wear.

173
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,454
The day of the experiment shoot comes up,

174
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,446
and I step out of my car in this costume,

175
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,120
and my crew takes a look at me ...

176
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,399
and start suppressing
their church giggles.

177
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,987
They're like,
"(Laugh sound)."

178
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,442
And I feel two distinct things
at this moment.

179
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,163
I feel total embarrassment

180
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,933
over the fact that
it's so nakedly clear to my crew

181
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,599
that I'm completely
into wearing this costume.

182
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:42,773
(Laughter)

183
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:46,548
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

184
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,999
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

185
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:52,116
that flowing coat is going to look
beautiful behind me.

186
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,290
(Laughter)

187
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,883
Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

188
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:58,563
we got invited to appear
at San Diego Comic-Con.

189
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,983
I'd known about Comic-Con for years
and never had time to go.

190
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:05,611
This was the big leagues --
this was costuming mecca.

191
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,675
People fly in from all over the world

192
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,821
to show their amazing creations
on the floor in San Diego.

193
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:12,370
And I wanted to participate.

194
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:15,456
I decided that I would put together
an elaborate costume

195
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,914
that covered me completely,

196
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,557
and I would walk the floor
of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.

197
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,899
The costume I chose?

198
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,073
Hellboy.

199
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:24,644
That's not my costume,

200
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:25,819
that's actually Hellboy.

201
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,862
(Laughter)

202
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,044
But I spent months

203
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,908
assembling the most screen-accurate
Hellboy costume I could,

204
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,867
from the boots to the belt to the pants

205
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,279
to the right hand of doom.

206
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,694
I found a guy who made
a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest

207
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,007
and I put them on.

208
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,762
I even had contact lenses made
in my prescription.

209
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,116
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

210
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,769
and I can't even tell you
how balls hot it was in that costume.

211
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,833
(Laughter)

212
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:52,892
Sweating! I should've remembered this.

213
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,805
I'm sweating buckets
and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,

214
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:59,378
and none of it matters
because I'm totally in love.

215
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,552
(Laughter)

216
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:04,629
Not just with the process of putting
on this costume and walking the floor,

217
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:08,232
but also with the community
of other costumers.

218
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,152
It's not called costuming at Cons,

219
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,002
it's called "cosplay."

220
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,550
Now ostensibly, cosplay means
people who dress up

221
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,137
as their favorite characters
from film and television

222
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,345
and especially anime,

223
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:21,110
but it is so much more than that.

224
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:24,195
These aren't just people
who find a costume and put it on --

225
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,616
they mash them up.

226
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,100
They bend them to their will.

227
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,916
They change them to be the characters
they want to be in those productions.

228
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,856
They're super clever and genius.

229
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,543
They let their freak flag fly
and it's beautiful.

230
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,606
(Laughter)

231
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,781
But more than that,

232
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,258
they rehearse their costumes.

233
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,758
At Comic-Con or any other Con,

234
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:43,329
you don't just take pictures
of people walking around.

235
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:44,508
You go up and say,

236
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,984
"Hey, I like your costume,
can I take your picture?"

237
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,804
And then you give them time
to get into their pose.

238
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,498
They've worked hard on their pose

239
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,142
to make their costume look
great for your camera.

240
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,656
And it's so beautiful to watch.

241
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:58,609
And I take this to heart.

242
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,139
At subsequent Cons,

243
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:04,556
I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk
as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."

244
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,630
I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith
from "Lord of the Rings,"

245
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,715
and I actually frighten some children.

246
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,639
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

247
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,800
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

248
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,599
And then I dressed up as
No-Face from "Spirited Away."

249
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:21,074
If you don't know about "Spirited Away"
and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,

250
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,549
first of all, you're welcome.

251
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,723
(Laughter)

252
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:27,576
This is a masterpiece,
and one of my all-time favorite films.

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,943
It's about a young girl named Chihiro
who gets lost in the spirit world

254
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,300
in an abandoned Japanese theme park.

255
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:36,220
And she finds her way back out again

256
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,560
with the help of a couple
of friends she makes --

257
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,074
a captured dragon named Haku

258
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,362
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

259
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,256
No-Face is lonely
and he wants to make friends,

260
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,445
and he thinks the way to do it
is by luring them to him

261
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,539
and producing gold in his hand.

262
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,314
But this doesn't go very well,

263
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:55,155
and so he ends up going
on kind of a rampage

264
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,435
until Chihiro saves him,

265
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,648
rescues him.

266
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:01,616
So I put together a No-Face costume,

267
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,988
and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

268
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:09,733
And I very carefully practiced
No-Face's gestures.

269
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:13,371
I resolved I would not speak
in this costume at all.

270
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,434
When people asked to take my picture,

271
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,083
I would nod

272
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:19,528
and I would shyly stand next to them.

273
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,218
They would take the picture

274
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:23,956
and then I would secret out
from behind my robe

275
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,502
a chocolate gold coin.

276
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,894
And at the end of the photo process,
I'd make it appear for them.

277
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,627
Ah, ah ah! -- like that.

278
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,034
And people were freaking out.

279
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,091
"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face!
Oh my god, this is so cool!"

280
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,505
And I'm feeling and I'm walking
the floor and it's fantastic.

281
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,783
And about 15 minutes in something happens.

282
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,394
Somebody grabs my hand,

283
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:48,092
and they put a coin back into it.

284
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,312
And I think maybe they're giving me
a coin as a return gift,

285
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,869
but no, this is one of the coins
that I'd given away.

286
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,680
I don't know why.

287
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,952
And I keep on going,
I take some more pictures.

288
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,427
And then it happens again.

289
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,150
Understand, I can't see anything
inside this costume.

290
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:04,661
I can see through the mouth --

291
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,304
I can see people's shoes.

292
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,143
I can hear what they're saying
and I can see their feet.

293
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,437
But the third time someone
gives me back a coin,

294
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:13,119
I want to know what's going on.

295
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:16,671
So I sort of tilt my head back
to get a better view,

296
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,009
and what I see is someone walking
away from me going like this.

297
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,773
And then it hits me:

298
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,233
it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.

299
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,169
In the film "Spirited Away,"

300
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:33,590
bad luck befalls those
who take gold from No-Face.

301
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:40,609
This isn't a performer-audience
relationship; this is cosplay.

302
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,068
We are, all of us on that floor,

303
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:47,425
injecting ourselves into a narrative
that meant something to us.

304
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,608
And we're making it our own.

305
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:53,732
We're connecting with something
important inside of us.

306
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,092
And the costumes
are how we reveal ourselves

307
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,299
to each other.

308
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:01,140
Thank you.

309
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:06,594
(Applause)
