0
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,296
I come from one of the most liberal,

1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,536
tolerant, progressive places
in the United States,

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,760
Seattle, Washington.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,376
And I grew up with a family
of great Seattlites.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,216
My mother was an artist,
my father was a college professor,

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,776
and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,296
because I always felt completely
comfortable designing my life

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,280
exactly as I saw fit.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,336
And in point of fact,

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,456
I took a route that was not exactly
what my parents had in mind.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,400
When I was 19, I dropped out of college --

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,176
dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,560
(Laughter)

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,936
And I went on the road
as a professional French horn player,

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,656
which was my lifelong dream.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,576
I played chamber music
all over the United States and Europe,

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,376
and I toured for a couple of years

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,376
with a great jazz guitar player
named Charlie Bird.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,976
And by the end of my 20s,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,176
I wound up as a member of the Barcelona
Symphony Orchestra in Spain.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,416
What a great life.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,016
And you know, my parents never complained.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,016
They supported me all the way through it.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,936
It wasn't their dream.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,103
They used to tell
their neighbors and friends,

25
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:26,176
"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,040
(Laughter)

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,776
And --

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,696
There was, however, one awkward
conversation about my lifestyle

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,176
that I want to tell you about.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,976
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,696
and I was visiting
my parents for Christmas,

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,400
and I was cooking dinner with my mother,
and we were alone in the kitchen.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,056
And she was quiet, too quiet.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,536
Something was wrong.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,080
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,016
And she said, "Your dad and I
are really worried about you."

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,936
And I said, "What?"
I mean, what could it be, at this point?

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,760
And she said, "I want you to be
completely honest with me:

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,616
have you been voting for Republicans?"

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,840
(Laughter)

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,056
Now, the truth is,

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,456
I wasn't really political,
I was just a French horn player.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,015
But I had a bit of an epiphany,

44
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,896
and they had detected it,
and it was causing some confusion.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,600
You see, I had become
an enthusiast for capitalism,

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,816
and I want to tell you why that is.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,976
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
in, believe it or not, poverty.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,256
See, when I was a kid
growing up in Seattle,

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,896
I remember the first time
I saw real poverty.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,296
We were a lower middle class family,
but that's of course not real poverty.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,056
That's not even close.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,496
The first time I saw poverty,
and poverty's face,

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,336
was when I was six
or seven years old, early 1970s.

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,896
And it was like a lot of you,
kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,296
It was a picture in the National
Geographic Magazine

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,616
of a kid who was my age in East Africa,

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,216
and there were flies on his face
and a distended belly.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,160
And he wasn't going to make it,
and I knew that, and I was helpless.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,696
Some of you remember that picture,

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,736
not exactly that picture,
one just like it.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,560
It introduced the West
to grinding poverty around the world.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,016
Well, that vision kind of haunted me
as I grew up and I went to school

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,816
and I dropped out and dropped in

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
and started my family.

66
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,496
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,200
Or to people just like him
all over the world?

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,976
And so I started to study,
even though I wasn't in college,

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,416
I was looking for the answer:

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,536
what happened to the world's
poorest people?

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,816
Has it gotten worse?
Has it gotten better? What?

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,616
And I found the answer,
and it changed my life,

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,200
and I want to share it with you.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
See --

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,016
most Americans believe
that poverty has gotten worse

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,176
since we were children,
since they saw that vision.

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,856
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty
gotten worse or better around the world?",

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,216
70 percent will say that hunger
has gotten worse since the early 1970s.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,736
But here's the truth.

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,456
Here's the epiphany that I had
that changed my thinking.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,240
From 1970 until today,

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,736
the percentage of the world's population

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,776
living in starvation levels,

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,456
living on a dollar a day or less,
obviously adjusted for inflation,

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,696
that percentage has declined

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
by 80 percent.

87
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,056
There's been an 80 percent decline
in the world's worst poverty

88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,296
since I was a kid.

89
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,896
And I didn't even know about it.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,800
This, my friends, that's a miracle.

91
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,616
That's something we ought to celebrate.

92
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,896
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement
in the history of mankind,

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,456
and it happened in our lifetimes.

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,016
(Applause)

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,896
So when I learned this, I asked,
what did that? What made it possible?

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,736
Because if you don't know why,
you can't do it again.

97
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,096
If you want to replicate it

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,656
and get the next two billion
people out of poverty,

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,456
because that's what we're talking about:
since I was a kid,

100
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,296
two billion of the least of these,
our brothers and sisters,

101
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,856
have been pulled out of poverty.

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,366
I want the next two billion,
so I've got to know why.

103
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,016
And I went in search of an answer.

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,696
And it wasn't a political answer,
because I didn't care.

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,376
You know what, I still don't care.

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,216
I wanted the best answer
from mainstream economists

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,360
left, right and center.

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
And here it is.

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,816
Here are the reasons.

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,576
There are five reasons that two billion
of our brothers and sisters

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,976
have been pulled out of poverty
since I was a kid.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,520
Number one: globalization.

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,176
Number two: free trade.

114
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,536
Number three: property rights.

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,096
Number four: rule of law.

116
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,096
Number five: entrepreneurship.

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,376
It was the free enterprise system
spreading around the world

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,176
after 1970 that did that.

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,616
Now, I'm not naive.

120
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,096
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,256
and I know that free enterprise
isn't everything we need

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,496
to build a better world.

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,056
But that is great.

124
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,416
And that's beyond politics.

125
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,536
Here's what I learned.
This is the epiphany.

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,576
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,136
At its best, it's about aspiration,

128
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,856
which is what so many people
on this stage talk about,

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,096
is the aspiration that comes from dreams

130
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,376
that are embedded
in the free enterprise system.

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,576
And we've got to share it
with more people.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,816
Now, I want to tell you
about a second epiphany

133
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,336
that's related to that first one

134
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,416
that I think can bring us progress,
not just around the world,

135
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
but right here at home.

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,856
The best quote I've ever heard

137
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,456
to summarize the thoughts
that I've just given you

138
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,536
about pulling people out of poverty

139
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,656
is as follows:

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,536
"Free markets have created more wealth
than any system in history.

141
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
They have lifted billions out of poverty."

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,656
Who said it?

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,080
It sounds like Milton Friedman
or Ronald Reagan.

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Wrong.

145
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,720
President Barack Obama said that.

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,040
Why do I know it by heart?

147
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
Because he said it to me.

148
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,136
Crazy.

149
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,840
And I said, "Hallelujah."

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,296
But more than that, I said,

151
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,016
"What an opportunity."

152
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,536
You know what I was thinking?

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,016
It was at an event
that we were doing on the subject

154
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,976
at Georgetown University in May of 2015.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,776
And I thought, this is the solution

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,296
to the biggest problem
facing America today. What?

157
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,096
It's coming together around these ideas,

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,856
liberals and conservatives,

159
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,960
to help people who need us the most.

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,776
Now, I don't have to tell anybody
in this room that we're in a crisis,

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,376
in America and many countries around
the world with political polarization.

162
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,296
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.

163
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,720
It's unpleasant. It's not right.

164
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,976
There was an article last year

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,616
in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences,

166
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,120
which is one of the most
prestigious scientific journals

167
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,336
published in the West.

168
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,816
And it was an article in 2014

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,256
on political motive asymmetry.

170
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,995
What's that? That's what psychologists
call the phenomenon

171
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,939
of assuming that your ideology
is based in love

172
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,320
but your opponents' ideology
is based in hate.

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,736
It's common in world conflict.

174
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,800
You expect to see this between
Palestinians and Israelis, for example.

175
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,816
What the authors of this article found

176
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,456
was that in America today,
a majority of Republicans and Democrats

177
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,056
suffer from political motive asymmetry.

178
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,936
A majority of people in our country today
who are politically active believe

179
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,376
that they are motivated by love
but the other side is motivated by hate.

180
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,936
Think about it. Think about it.

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,135
Most people are walking around saying,

182
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,336
"You know, my ideology
is based on basic benevolence,

183
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,576
I want to help people,

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
but the other guys,
they're evil and out to get me."

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,496
You can't progress as a society
when you have this kind of asymmetry.

186
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
It's impossible.

187
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,816
How do we solve it?

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,496
Well, first, let's be honest:
there are differences.

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,216
Let's not minimize the differences.
That would be really naïve.

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,296
There's a lot of good research on this.

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,456
A veteran of the TED stage
is my friend Jonathan Haidt.

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,536
He's a psychology professor
at New York University.

193
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,496
He does work on the ideology
and values and morals of different people

194
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,760
to see how they differ.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,170
And he's shown, for example,
that conservatives and liberals

196
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:38,210
have a very different emphasis
on what they think is important.

197
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:41,536
For example, Jon Haidt has shown

198
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,536
that liberals care about poverty

199
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
59 percent more than they care
about economic liberty.

200
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,776
And conservatives
care about economic liberty

201
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
28 percent more
than they care about poverty.

202
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,976
Irreconcilable differences, right?

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We'll never come together. Wrong.

204
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,896
That is diversity
in which lies our strength.

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,056
Remember what pulled up the poor.

206
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,136
It was the obsession with poverty,

207
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,376
accompanied by the method
of economic freedom

208
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,016
spreading around the world.

209
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,576
We need each other, in other words,

210
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,220
if we want to help people and get the next
two billion people out of poverty.

211
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:23,524
There's no other way.

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,896
Hmm.

213
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
How are we going to get that?

214
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,016
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.

215
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,256
We need innovative thinking.

216
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,936
A lot of it's on this stage.

217
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,120
Social entrepreneurship.
Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.

218
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,616
We need investment overseas

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,016
in a sustainable, responsible,
ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.

220
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,856
But you know what we really need?

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,496
We need a new day in flexible ideology.

222
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
We need to be less predictable.

223
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,896
Don't we?

224
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,496
Do you ever feel like your own ideology
is starting to get predictable?

225
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,256
Kinda conventional?

226
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,416
Do you ever feel like you're always
listening to people who agree with you?

227
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,176
Why is that dangerous?

228
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,776
Because when we talk
in this country about economics,

229
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,456
on the right, conservatives,

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,120
you're always talking about taxes
and regulations and big government.

231
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,616
And on the left, liberals,
you're talking about economics,

232
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,896
it's always about income inequality.

233
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,336
Right? Now those are important things,

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,616
really important to me,
really important to you.

235
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,176
But when it comes to lifting people up

236
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,656
who are starving and need us today,
those are distractions.

237
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,096
We need to come together
around the best ways

238
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,456
to mitigate poverty
using the best tools at our disposal,

239
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,976
and that comes only when conservatives
recognize that they need liberals

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,616
and their obsession with poverty,

241
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,760
and liberals need conservatives
and their obsession with free markets.

242
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,736
That's the diversity in which lies
the future strength of this country,

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,720
if we choose to take it.

244
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,816
So how are we going to do it?
How are we going to do it together?

245
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,000
I've got to have some action items,
not just for you but for me.

246
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,296
Number one. Action item number one:

247
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,536
remember, it's not good enough
just to tolerate people who disagree.

248
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,256
It's not good enough.

249
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,176
We have to remember that we need
people who disagree with us,

250
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,536
because there are people
who need all of us

251
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,000
who are still waiting for these tools.

252
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,976
Now, what are you going to do?
How are you going to express that?

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,936
Where does this start? It starts here.

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,216
You know, all of us
in this room, we're blessed.

255
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,296
We're blessed with people
who listen to us.

256
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,216
We're blessed with prosperity.
We're blessed with leadership.

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,640
When people hear us,
with the kind of unpredictable ideology,

258
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,616
then maybe people will listen.

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,816
Maybe progress will start at that point.

260
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
That's number one. Number two.

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,960
Number two: I'm asking you
and I'm asking me

262
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,056
to be the person specifically
who blurs the lines,

263
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,360
who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.

264
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,416
If you're a conservative,

265
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,976
be the conservative
who is always going on about poverty

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,816
and the moral obligation
to be a warrior for the poor.

267
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,536
And if you're a liberal,
be a liberal who is always talking

268
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,136
about the beauty of free markets
to solve our problems

269
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,760
when we use them responsibly.

270
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,056
If we do that, we get two things.

271
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,656
Number one: we get to start
to work on the next two billion

272
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,216
and be the solution
that we've seen so much of in the past

273
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,136
and we need to see more of in the future.
That's what we get.

274
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,136
And the second is
that we might just be able

275
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,816
to take the ghastly holy war of ideology
that we're suffering under in this country

276
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,096
and turn it into a competition of ideas

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,096
based on solidarity and mutual respect.

278
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,976
And then maybe, just maybe,

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,680
we'll all realize that our big differences

280
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,480
aren't really that big after all.

281
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,616
Thank you.

282
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,468
(Applause)
