0
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:17,950
Virtual reality started for me
in sort of an unusual place.

1
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:21,173
It was the 1970s.

2
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:24,383
I got into the field very young:
I was seven years old.

3
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:29,245
And the tool that I used
to access virtual reality

4
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:32,810
was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,201
This is a commercial for
that particular item:

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,776
(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!

7
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,767
Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.

8
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,536
That gyro-power sends him
over 100 feet at top speed.

9
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,628
Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.

10
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,587
I rode this motorcycle everywhere.

11
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:50,847
And I was there with Evel Knievel; we
jumped the Snake River Canyon together.

12
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:52,216
I wanted the rocket.

13
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,996
I never got the rocket,
I only got the motorcycle.

14
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:00,203
I felt so connected to this world.

15
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:04,440
I didn't want to be a storyteller
when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,644
I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.

17
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,027
I had so much empathy for him.

18
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:13,358
But it didn't work out. (Laughter)

19
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,382
I went to art school.

20
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:17,792
I started making music videos.

21
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,866
And this is one of the early
music videos that I made:

22
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:26,756
(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)

23
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:30,032
CM: You may notice
some slight similarities here.

24
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,818
(Laughter)

25
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:34,461
And I got that rocket.

26
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,104
(Laughter)

27
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:41,509
So, now I'm a filmmaker,
or, the beginning of a filmmaker,

28
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,243
and I started using the tools that are
available to me as a filmmaker

29
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:49,831
to try to tell the most compelling stories
that I can to an audience.

30
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,980
And film is this incredible medium
that allows us to feel empathy

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,006
for people that are very different than us

32
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,838
and worlds completely
foreign from our own.

33
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,668
Unfortunately,

34
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:03,527
Evel Knievel did not feel the same
empathy for us that we felt for him,

35
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:06,330
and he sued us for this video --

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,061
(Laughter) --

37
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,110
shortly thereafter.

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,950
On the upside, the man
that I worshipped as a child,

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,066
the man that I wanted
to become as an adult,

40
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:21,906
I was finally able to get his autograph.

41
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:25,902
(Applause)

42
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:34,849
Let's talk about film now.

43
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,745
Film, it's an incredible medium,

44
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:41,060
but essentially, it's the same
now as it was then.

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,529
It's a group of rectangles that are
played in a sequence.

46
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:48,362
And we've done incredible things
with those rectangles.

47
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:51,247
But I started thinking about,

48
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:55,616
is there a way that I can use modern
and developing technologies

49
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,741
to tell stories in different ways

50
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,482
and tell different kinds of stories

51
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:03,793
that maybe I couldn't tell using
the traditional tools of filmmaking

52
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,964
that we've been using for 100 years?

53
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,785
So I started experimenting,

54
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:13,874
and what I was trying to do was
to build the ultimate empathy machine.

55
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:17,588
And here's one of the early experiments:

56
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,412
(Music)

57
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:22,656
So this is called
"The Wilderness Downtown."

58
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,712
It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

59
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:28,362
It asked you to put in the address
where you grew up at the beginning of it.

60
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:29,359
It's a website.

61
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,275
And out of it starts growing these little
boxes with different browser windows.

62
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:36,657
And you see this teenager
running down a street,

63
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,415
and then you see Google Street View
and Google Maps imagery

64
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,939
and you realize the street
he's running down is yours.

65
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,048
And when he stops in front of a house,
he stops in front of your house.

66
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:51,417
And this was great, and I saw people
having an even deeper emotional reaction

67
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:54,631
to this than the things that
I had made in rectangles.

68
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:58,562
And I'm essentially taking
a piece of your history

69
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:01,981
and putting it inside
the framing of the story.

70
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,578
But then I started thinking,

71
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,430
okay, well that's a part of you,

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,731
but how do I put all of you
inside of the frame?

73
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:13,834
So to do that, I started
making art installations.

74
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,374
And this is one called
"The Treachery of Sanctuary."

75
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:19,392
It's a triptych. I'm going to show
you the third panel.

76
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,230
(Music)

77
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,848
So now I've got you inside of the frame,

78
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:51,403
and I saw people having even more
visceral emotional reactions

79
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:54,080
to this work than the previous one.

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,230
But then I started thinking about frames,
and what do they represent?

81
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,487
And a frame is just a window.

82
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:03,566
I mean, all the media that we watch --
television, cinema --

83
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,819
they're these windows into
these other worlds.

84
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,507
And I thought, well, great.
I got you in a frame.

85
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:11,634
But I don't want you in the frame,
I don't want you in the window,

86
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,523
I want you through the window,
I want you on the other side,

87
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,598
in the world, inhabiting the world.

88
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,123
So that leads me back to virtual reality.

89
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,344
Let's talk about virtual reality.

90
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,934
Unfortunately,

91
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:30,423
talking about virtual reality
is like dancing about architecture.

92
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:37,340
And this is actually someone dancing
about architecture in virtual reality.

93
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,823
(Laughter)

94
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:43,084
So, it's difficult to explain.
Why is it difficult to explain?

95
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:46,782
It's difficult because it's a very
experiential medium.

96
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:48,698
You feel your way inside of it.

97
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,496
It's a machine, but inside of it,

98
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,945
it feels like real life,
it feels like truth.

99
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:56,466
And you feel present in the world
that you're inside

100
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:59,689
and you feel present with the people
that you're inside of it with.

101
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,785
So, I'm going to show you a demo
of a virtual reality film:

102
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,006
a full-screen version of
all the information

103
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,209
that we capture when
we shoot virtual reality.

104
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,034
So we're shooting in every direction.

105
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,210
This is a camera system that we built

106
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,235
that has 3D cameras that look
in every direction

107
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,987
and binaural microphones
that face in every direction.

108
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:23,333
We take this and we build, basically,
a sphere of a world that you inhabit.

109
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,736
So what I'm going to show you
is not a view into the world,

110
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:30,107
it's basically the whole world
stretched into a rectangle.

111
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:33,495
So this film is called
"Clouds Over Sidra,"

112
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:37,989
and it was made in conjunction with
our virtual reality company called VRSE

113
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,755
and the United Nations,

114
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:42,788
and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.

115
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,625
And we went to a Syrian refugee camp
in Jordan in December

116
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,982
and shot the story of a 12-year-old
girl there named Sidra.

117
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:54,473
And she and her family fled Syria
through the desert into Jordan

118
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:58,567
and she's been living in this
camp for the last year and a half.

119
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,720
(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,616
I am 12 years old.

121
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:06,418
I am in the fifth grade.

122
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,605
I am from Syria,
in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.

123
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:16,843
I have lived here in the Zaatari camp
in Jordan for the last year and a half.

124
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,931
I have a big family:

125
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:23,697
three brothers, one is a baby.

126
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:27,142
He cries a lot.

127
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:32,197
I asked my father if I cried when
I was a baby and he says I did not.

128
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:35,821
I think I was a stronger baby
than my brother.

129
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,731
CM: So, when you're inside
of the headset.

130
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,351
you're not seeing it like this.

131
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,423
You're looking around through this world.

132
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:47,711
You'll notice you see full
360 degrees, in all directions.

133
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,702
And when you're sitting there
in her room, watching her,

134
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,115
you're not watching it through
a television screen,

135
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:56,523
you're not watching it through a window,
you're sitting there with her.

136
00:07:56,523 --> 00:08:00,896
When you look down, you're sitting
on the same ground that she's sitting on.

137
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,666
And because of that,

138
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:07,054
you feel her humanity in a deeper way.

139
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:11,590
You empathize with her in a deeper way.

140
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,917
And I think that we can change
minds with this machine.

141
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,690
And we've already started
to try to change a few.

142
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,536
So we took this film to the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January.

143
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:29,022
And we showed it to a group of people

144
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:33,102
whose decisions affect the lives
of millions of people.

145
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,220
And these are people
who might not otherwise

146
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,484
be sitting in a tent
in a refugee camp in Jordan.

147
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:47,813
But in January, one afternoon
in Switzerland,

148
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:51,429
they suddenly all found themselves there.

149
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:56,489
(Applause)

150
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,058
And they were affected by it.

151
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:04,374
So we're going to make more of them.

152
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:07,460
We're working with the
United Nations right now

153
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,515
to shoot a whole series of these films.

154
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,187
We just finished shooting
a story in Liberia.

155
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:15,633
And now, we're going
to shoot a story in India.

156
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,511
And we're taking these films,

157
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:20,036
and we're showing them
at the United Nations

158
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,023
to people that work there and people
that are visiting there.

159
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,810
And we're showing
them to the people

160
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,274
that can actually change the lives
of the people inside of the films.

161
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:32,955
And that's where I think we just
start to scratch the surface

162
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:36,614
of the true power of virtual reality.

163
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,835
It's not a video game peripheral.

164
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:43,408
It connects humans to other humans
in a profound way

165
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,873
that I've never seen before
in any other form of media.

166
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:50,612
And it can change people's
perception of each other.

167
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:52,298
And that's how I think

168
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:55,734
virtual reality has the potential
to actually change the world.

00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:01,151
So, it's a machine,

170
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:06,074
but through this machine
we become more compassionate,

171
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:11,667
we become more empathetic,
and we become more connected.

172
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,521
And ultimately, we become more human.

173
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,651
Thank you.

174
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,771
