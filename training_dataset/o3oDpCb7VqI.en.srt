0
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:14,918
This is my great uncle,

1
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:17,936
my father's father's younger brother.

2
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,902
His name was Joe McKenna.

3
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:25,089
He was a young husband
and a semi-pro basketball player

4
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,417
and a fireman in New York City.

5
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:32,007
Family history says
he loved being a fireman,

6
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,542
and so in 1938, on one of his days off,

7
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,319
he elected to hang out at the firehouse.

8
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:43,218
To make himself useful that day,
he started polishing all the brass,

9
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:46,612
the railings on the fire truck,
the fittings on the walls,

10
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,957
and one of the fire hose nozzles,

11
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,465
a giant, heavy piece of metal,

12
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:55,074
toppled off a shelf and hit him.

13
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:59,382
A few days later,
his shoulder started to hurt.

14
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:02,656
Two days after that, he spiked a fever.

15
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:05,141
The fever climbed and climbed.

16
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,091
His wife was taking care of him,

17
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:11,393
but nothing she did made a difference,
and when they got the local doctor in,

18
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:13,679
nothing he did mattered either.

19
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:17,460
They flagged down a cab
and took him to the hospital.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,905
The nurses there recognized right away
that he had an infection,

21
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:26,061
what at the time they would
have called "blood poisoning,"

22
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:28,174
and though they probably didn't say it,

23
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:30,031
they would have known right away

24
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,430
that there was nothing they could do.

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,788
There was nothing they could do
because the things we use now

26
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:39,437
to cure infections didn't exist yet.

27
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:43,173
The first test of penicillin,
the first antibiotic,

28
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,843
was three years in the future.

29
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:50,547
People who got infections
either recovered, if they were lucky,

30
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:52,042
or they died.

31
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:54,411
My great uncle was not lucky.

32
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:57,708
He was in the hospital for a week,
shaking with chills,

33
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,566
dehydrated and delirious,

34
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:02,468
sinking into a coma as his organs failed.

35
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:04,604
His condition grew so desperate

36
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:09,234
that the people from his firehouse
lined up to give him transfusions

37
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:13,097
hoping to dilute the infection
surging through his blood.

38
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:16,603
Nothing worked. He died.

39
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,705
He was 30 years old.

40
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,088
If you look back through history,

41
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:25,362
most people died the way
my great uncle died.

42
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,032
Most people didn't die
of cancer or heart disease,

43
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:32,120
the lifestyle diseases that afflict us
in the West today.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,229
They didn't die of those diseases
because they didn't live long enough

45
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,225
to develop them.

46
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,338
They died of injuries --

47
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,823
being gored by an ox,

48
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,727
shot on a battlefield,

49
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:48,465
crushed in one of the new factories
of the Industrial Revolution --

50
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:51,846
and most of the time from infection,

51
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:55,352
which finished what those injuries began.

52
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,024
All of that changed
when antibiotics arrived.

53
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,198
Suddenly, infections that had
been a death sentence

54
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:07,588
became something
you recovered from in days.

55
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,630
It seemed like a miracle,

56
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,954
and ever since, we have been living inside
the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.

57
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,241
And now, we are coming to an end of it.

58
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:26,303
My great uncle died in the last days
of the pre-antibiotic era.

59
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:31,457
We stand today on the threshold
of the post-antibiotic era,

60
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:35,219
in the earliest days of a time
when simple infections

61
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,928
such as the one Joe had
will kill people once again.

62
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:44,015
In fact, they already are.

63
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,618
People are dying of infections again
because of a phenomenon

64
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,961
called antibiotic resistance.

65
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,119
Briefly, it works like this.

66
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:57,091
Bacteria compete against each other
for resources, for food,

67
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:01,758
by manufacturing lethal compounds
that they direct against each other.

68
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:04,103
Other bacteria, to protect themselves,

69
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:07,354
evolve defenses against
that chemical attack.

70
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:09,676
When we first made antibiotics,

71
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:13,878
we took those compounds into the lab
and made our own versions of them,

72
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,336
and bacteria responded to our attack
the way they always had.

73
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,898
Here is what happened next:

74
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:25,488
Penicillin was distributed in 1943,

75
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:30,619
and widespread penicillin resistance
arrived by 1945.

76
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,568
Vancomycin arrived in 1972,

77
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:36,668
vancomycin resistance in 1988.

78
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,150
Imipenem in 1985,

79
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,922
and resistance to in 1998.

80
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:45,860
Daptomycin, one of
the most recent drugs, in 2003,

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,225
and resistance to it
just a year later in 2004.

82
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:54,335
For 70 years, we played
a game of leapfrog --

83
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,261
our drug and their resistance,

84
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:00,906
and then another drug,
and then resistance again --

85
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:03,217
and now the game is ending.

86
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,477
Bacteria develop resistance so quickly
that pharmaceutical companies

87
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:11,842
have decided making antibiotics
is not in their best interest,

88
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:14,652
so there are infections
moving across the world

89
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:18,111
for which, out of the more
than 100 antibiotics

90
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,340
available on the market,

91
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,754
two drugs might work with side effects,

92
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:26,238
or one drug,

93
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,646
or none.

94
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,668
This is what that looks like.

95
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:34,458
In 2000, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the CDC,

96
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,501
identified a single case

97
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,753
in a hospital in North Carolina

98
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:42,486
of an infection resistant
to all but two drugs.

99
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:47,205
Today, that infection, known as KPC,

100
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:49,805
has spread to every state but three,

101
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:52,150
and to South America, Europe

102
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,357
and the Middle East.

103
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:57,189
In 2008, doctors in Sweden

104
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,975
diagnosed a man from India
with a different infection

105
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:03,690
resistant to all but one drug that time.

106
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,919
The gene that creates that resistance,

107
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,444
known as NDM, has now spread
from India into China, Asia, Africa,

108
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:16,809
Europe and Canada, and the United States.

109
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,688
It would be natural to hope

110
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:23,287
that these infections
are extraordinary cases,

111
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,145
but in fact,

112
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,606
in the United States and Europe,

113
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:30,322
50,000 people a year

114
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:34,446
die of infections which no drugs can help.

115
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:38,008
A project chartered
by the British government

116
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:41,746
known as the Review
on Antimicrobial Resistance

117
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:49,118
estimates that the worldwide toll
right now is 700,000 deaths a year.

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:54,655
That is a lot of deaths,

119
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,767
and yet, the chances are good
that you don't feel at risk,

120
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,995
that you imagine these people
were hospital patients

121
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,713
in intensive care units

122
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,660
or nursing home residents
near the ends of their lives,

123
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,841
people whose infections
are remote from us,

124
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:13,045
in situations we can't identify with.

125
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:17,852
What you didn't think about,
none of us do,

126
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:22,818
is that antibiotics support
almost all of modern life.

127
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,932
If we lost antibiotics,

128
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:27,386
here's what else we'd lose:

129
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:32,015
First, any protection for people
with weakened immune systems --

130
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:35,475
cancer patients, AIDS patients,

131
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:39,979
transplant recipients, premature babies.

132
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,391
Next, any treatment that installs
foreign objects in the body:

133
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:48,269
stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,

134
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:52,193
dialysis, joint replacements.

135
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:55,908
How many athletic baby boomers
need new hips and knees?

136
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,717
A recent study estimates
that without antibiotics,

137
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:02,234
one out of ever six would die.

138
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:05,869
Next, we'd probably lose surgery.

139
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,191
Many operations are preceded

140
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,139
by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.

141
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,811
Without that protection,

142
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:17,015
we'd lose the ability to open
the hidden spaces of the body.

143
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:19,848
So no heart operations,

144
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,680
no prostate biopsies,

145
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,382
no Cesarean sections.

146
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:30,444
We'd have to learn to fear infections
that now seem minor.

147
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:34,592
Strep throat used to cause heart failure.

148
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,239
Skin infections led to amputations.

149
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,722
Giving birth killed,
in the cleanest hospitals,

150
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,397
almost one woman out of every 100.

151
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:48,550
Pneumonia took three children
out of every 10.

152
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,333
More than anything else,

153
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,708
we'd lose the confident way
we live our everyday lives.

154
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:01,043
If you knew that any injury
could kill you,

155
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:04,289
would you ride a motorcycle,

156
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,500
bomb down a ski slope,

157
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,976
climb a ladder to hang
your Christmas lights,

158
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:14,643
let your kid slide into home plate?

159
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:18,638
After all, the first person
to receive penicillin,

160
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:22,516
a British policeman named
Albert Alexander,

161
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,858
who was so ravaged by infection
that his scalp oozed pus

162
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,783
and doctors had to take out an eye,

163
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:33,162
was infected by doing
something very simple.

164
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:38,988
He walked into his garden
and scratched his face on a thorn.

165
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,481
That British project I mentioned
which estimates that the worldwide toll

166
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:48,358
right now is 700,000 deaths a year

167
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:54,535
also predicts that if we can't
get this under control by 2050,

168
00:09:54,535 --> 00:10:02,127
not long, the worldwide toll
will be 10 million deaths a year.

169
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,829
How did we get to this point

170
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,864
where what we have to look forward to

171
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:10,347
is those terrifying numbers?

172
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:14,535
The difficult answer is,
we did it to ourselves.

173
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,847
Resistance is an inevitable
biological process,

174
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:21,900
but we bear the responsibility
for accelerating it.

175
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,043
We did this by squandering antibiotics

176
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:30,131
with a heedlessness
that now seems shocking.

177
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:35,494
Penicillin was sold
over the counter until the 1950s.

178
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:38,829
In much of the developing world,
most antibiotics still are.

179
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,971
In the United States, 50 percent

180
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:46,663
of the antibiotics given
in hospitals are unnecessary.

181
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:51,037
Forty-five percent of the prescriptions
written in doctor's offices

182
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:55,010
are for conditions
that antibiotics cannot help.

183
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:59,247
And that's just in healthcare.

184
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:04,100
On much of the planet, most meat animals
get antibiotics every day of their lives,

185
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,376
not to cure illnesses,

186
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:09,835
but to fatten them up
and to protect them against

187
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,806
the factory farm conditions
they are raised in.

188
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,824
In the United States, possibly 80 percent

189
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:23,527
of the antibiotics sold every year
go to farm animals, not to humans,

190
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:27,203
creating resistant bacteria
that move off the farm

191
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,827
in water, in dust,

192
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:32,695
in the meat the animals become.

193
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,910
Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,

194
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,559
particularly in Asia,

195
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,902
and fruit growing relies on antibiotics

196
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:45,801
to protect apples, pears,
citrus, against disease.

197
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:52,117
And because bacteria can pass
their DNA to each other

198
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:56,552
like a traveler handing off
a suitcase at an airport,

199
00:11:56,552 --> 00:12:01,360
once we have encouraged
that resistance into existence,

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,587
there is no knowing where it will spread.

201
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,294
This was predictable.

202
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,506
In fact, it was predicted

203
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:14,941
by Alexander Fleming,
the man who discovered penicillin.

204
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:18,935
He was given the Nobel Prize
in 1945 in recognition,

205
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:23,282
and in an interview shortly after,
this is what he said:

206
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:27,549
"The thoughtless person playing
with penicillin treatment

207
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,823
is morally responsible
for the death of a man

208
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:33,147
who succumbs to infection

209
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:36,050
with a pencillin-resistant organism."

210
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,335
He added, "I hope this evil
can be averted."

211
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,842
Can we avert it?

212
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:47,510
There are companies working
on novel antibiotics,

213
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,086
things the superbugs
have never seen before.

214
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,803
We need those new drugs badly,

215
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:56,055
and we need incentives:

216
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,586
discovery grants, extended patents,

217
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:05,343
prizes, to lure other companies
into making antibiotics again.

218
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:07,709
But that probably won't be enough.

219
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:12,163
Here's why: Evolution always wins.

220
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:16,627
Bacteria birth a new generation
every 20 minutes.

221
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:21,410
It takes pharmaceutical chemistry
10 years to derive a new drug.

222
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,266
Every time we use an antibiotic,

223
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,540
we give the bacteria billions of chances

224
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,281
to crack the codes

225
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,486
of the defenses we've constructed.

226
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,877
There has never yet been a drug

227
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:37,431
they could not defeat.

228
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,961
This is asymmetric warfare,

229
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,969
but we can change the outcome.

230
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:52,334
We could build systems to harvest data
to tell us automatically and specifically

231
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:55,263
how antibiotics are being used.

232
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:58,096
We could build gatekeeping
into drug order systems

233
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:01,811
so that every prescription
gets a second look.

234
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:07,920
We could require agriculture
to give up antibiotic use.

235
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,275
We could build surveillance systems

236
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:15,501
to tell us where resistance
is emerging next.

237
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,814
Those are the tech solutions.

238
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,888
They probably aren't enough either,

239
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:24,117
unless we help.

240
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,099
Antibiotic resistance is a habit.

241
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:33,567
We all know how hard it is
to change a habit.

242
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:38,097
But as a society,
we've done that in the past.

243
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:41,972
People used to toss litter
into the streets,

244
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,737
used to not wear seatbelts,

245
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:47,994
used to smoke inside public buildings.

246
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,624
We don't do those things anymore.

247
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,466
We don't trash the environment

248
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:56,623
or court devastating accidents

249
00:14:56,623 --> 00:14:59,595
or expose others
to the possibility of cancer,

250
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:03,102
because we decided those things
were expensive,

251
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:07,175
destructive, not in our best interest.

252
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,715
We changed social norms.

253
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:15,279
We could change social norms
around antibiotic use too.

254
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,774
I know that the scale
of antibiotic resistance

255
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,678
seems overwhelming,

256
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:25,138
but if you've ever bought
a fluorescent lightbulb

257
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:27,854
because you were concerned
about climate change,

258
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,989
or read the label on a box of crackers

259
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:35,470
because you think about
the deforestation from palm oil,

260
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,349
you already know what it feels like

261
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:43,349
to take a tiny step to address
an overwhelming problem.

262
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,310
We could take those kinds of steps
for antibiotic use too.

263
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:55,947
We could forgo giving an antibiotic
if we're not sure it's the right one.

264
00:15:56,251 --> 00:16:02,564
We could stop insisting on a prescription
for our kid's ear infection

265
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,462
before we're sure what caused it.

266
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:09,045
We could ask every restaurant,

267
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:10,856
every supermarket,

268
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,476
where their meat comes from.

269
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,640
We could promise each other

270
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,745
never again to buy chicken
or shrimp or fruit

271
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,629
raised with routine antibiotic use,

272
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,323
and if we did those things,

273
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:28,815
we could slow down the arrival
of the post-antibiotic world.

274
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:33,680
But we have to do it soon.

275
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,185
Penicillin began
the antibiotic era in 1943.

276
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:43,891
In just 70 years, we walked ourselves
up to the edge of disaster.

277
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,613
We won't get 70 years

278
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:50,339
to find our way back out again.

279
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,279
Thank you very much.

280
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:58,640
(Applause)
