0
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,896
Every weekend for as long
as I can remember,

1
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:19,953
my father would get up on a Saturday,

2
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:22,443
put on a worn sweatshirt

3
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:24,318
and he'd scrape away

4
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:27,165
at the squeaky old wheel
of a house that we lived in.

5
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,469
I wouldn't even call it restoration;

6
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:31,428
it was a ritual, catharsis.

7
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,266
He would spend all year
scraping paint with this old heat gun

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,534
and a spackle knife,

9
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,635
and then he would repaint
where he scraped,

10
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,028
only to begin again the following year.

11
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:44,118
Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:

12
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:47,632
the work of an old house
is never meant to be done.

13
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:52,921
The day my father turned 52,
I got a phone call.

14
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:54,367
My mother was on the line

15
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,129
to tell me that doctors had found
a lump in his stomach --

16
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,172
terminal cancer, she told me,

17
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,790
and he had been given
only three weeks to live.

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,790
I immediately moved home
to Poughkeepsie, New York,

19
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:10,222
to sit with my father on death watch,

20
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:12,638
not knowing what the next days
would bring us.

21
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,896
To keep myself distracted,

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,674
I rolled up my sleeves,

23
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:20,603
and I went about finishing
what he could now no longer complete --

24
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,019
the restoration of our old home.

25
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,707
When that looming three-week deadline came

26
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,889
and then went,

27
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,544
he was still alive.

28
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:31,386
And at three months,

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,576
he joined me.

30
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,576
We gutted and repainted the interior.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,894
At six months, the old windows
were refinished,

32
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,213
and at 18 months,

33
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,886
the rotted porch was finally replaced.

34
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,403
And there was my father,

35
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:48,680
standing with me outside,
admiring a day's work,

36
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:51,257
hair on his head, fully in remission,

37
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:53,961
when he turned to me and he said,

38
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:55,142
"You know, Michael,

39
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,115
this house saved my life."

40
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:03,360
So the following year, I decided
to go to architecture school.

41
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,317
(Laughter)

42
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,049
But there, I learned
something different about buildings.

43
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:10,704
Recognition seemed to come

44
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:14,279
to those who prioritized
novel and sculptural forms,

45
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,775
like ribbons, or ...

46
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,673
pickles?

47
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:21,006
(Laughter)

48
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,357
And I think this
is supposed to be a snail.

49
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,264
Something about this bothered me.

50
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:32,914
Why was it that the best architects,
the greatest architecture --

51
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,540
all beautiful and visionary
and innovative --

52
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:38,249
is also so rare,

53
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,720
and seems to serve so very few?

54
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:43,212
And more to the point:

55
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:46,691
With all of this creative talent,
what more could we do?

56
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,865
Just as I was about to start
my final exams,

57
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,589
I decided to take a break
from an all-nighter

58
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:56,930
and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,

59
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:00,510
a leading health activist
for the global poor.

60
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:04,316
I was surprised to hear a doctor
talking about architecture.

61
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,822
Buildings are making
people sicker, he said,

62
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,639
and for the poorest in the world,

63
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:11,559
this is causing epidemic-level problems.

64
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,553
In this hospital in South Africa,

65
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,761
patients that came in
with, say, a broken leg,

66
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:18,381
to wait in this unventilated hallway,

67
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:22,932
walked out with a multidrug-resistant
strand of tuberculosis.

68
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:26,918
Simple designs for infection control
had not been thought about,

69
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,460
and people had died because of it.

70
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:33,164
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.

71
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,693
If hospitals are making people sicker,

72
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,621
where are the architects and designers

73
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:42,255
to help us build and design
hospitals that allow us to heal?

74
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,126
That following summer,

75
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,952
I was in the back of a Land Rover
with a few classmates,

76
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:52,457
bumping over the mountainous
hillside of Rwanda.

77
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:56,933
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro
in this old guesthouse,

78
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,154
which was a jail after the genocide.

79
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:04,888
I was there to design and build
a new type of hospital

80
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,106
with Dr. Farmer and his team.

81
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,099
If hallways are making patients sicker,

82
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:13,877
what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,

83
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,219
and makes people walk in the exterior?

84
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:18,612
If mechanical systems rarely work,

85
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,219
what if we could design a hospital
that could breathe

86
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,119
through natural ventilation,

87
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,285
and meanwhile reduce
its environmental footprint?

88
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,865
And what about the patients' experience?

89
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,205
Evidence shows
that a simple view of nature

90
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,388
can radically improve health outcomes,

91
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,814
So why couldn't we design a hospital

92
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,551
where every patient
had a window with a view?

93
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:43,987
Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.

94
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,547
Designing it is one thing;

95
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,797
getting it built, we learned,
is quite another.

96
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:52,303
We worked with Bruce Nizeye,

97
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,840
a brilliant engineer,

98
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:55,988
and he thought about
construction differently

99
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,868
than I had been taught in school.

100
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,782
When we had to excavate
this enormous hilltop

101
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:03,741
and a bulldozer was expensive
and hard to get to site,

102
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,285
Bruce suggested doing it by hand,

103
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,983
using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"

104
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,556
which means "community works
for the community."

105
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:16,406
Hundreds of people came
with shovels and hoes,

106
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,795
and we excavated that hill

107
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,428
in half the time and half
the cost of that bulldozer.

108
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:26,268
Instead of importing furniture,
Bruce started a guild,

109
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,699
and he brought in
master carpenters to train others

110
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:30,477
in how to make furniture by hand.

111
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,071
And on this job site,

112
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,584
15 years after the Rwandan genocide,

113
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:39,931
Bruce insisted that we bring on
labor from all backgrounds,

114
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:41,867
and that half of them be women.

115
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,947
Bruce was using
the process of building to heal,

116
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,956
not just for those who were sick,

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,678
but for the entire community as a whole.

118
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:55,941
We call this the locally fabricated
way of building, or "lo-fab,"

119
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,321
and it has four pillars:

120
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,158
hire locally,

121
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:01,617
source regionally,

122
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,531
train where you can

123
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,119
and most importantly,

124
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:08,705
think about every design decision
as an opportunity

125
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,645
to invest in the dignity
of the places where you serve.

126
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,049
Think of it like the local food movement,

127
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,428
but for architecture.

128
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,944
And we're convinced
that this way of building

129
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,906
can be replicated across the world,

130
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,477
and change the way we talk about
and evaluate architecture.

131
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,207
Using the lo-fab way of building,

132
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:33,027
even aesthetic decisions
can be designed to impact people's lives.

133
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:36,464
In Butaro, we chose to use
a local volcanic stone

134
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,516
found in abundance within the area,

135
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,577
but often considered
a nuisance by farmers,

136
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,330
and piled on the side of the road.

137
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:45,155
We worked with these masons
to cut these stones

138
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,370
and form them into the walls
of the hospital.

139
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,591
And when they began on this corner

140
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,703
and wrapped around the entire hospital,

141
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,805
they were so good at putting
these stones together,

142
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,441
they asked us if they could take down
the original wall and rebuild it.

143
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,753
And you see what is possible.

144
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:04,700
It's beautiful.

145
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,673
And the beauty, to me,

146
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,915
comes from the fact that I know
that hands cut these stones,

147
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,420
and they formed them into this thick wall,

148
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:18,434
made only in this place
with rocks from this soil.

149
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,208
When you go outside today
and you look at your built world,

150
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,154
ask not only:

151
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,404
"What is the environmental footprint?" --
an important question --

152
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:30,702
but what if we also asked,

153
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:34,382
"What is the human handprint
of those who made it?"

154
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:39,071
We started a new practice
based around these questions,

155
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,644
and we tested it around the world.

156
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,618
Like in Haiti,

157
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:48,241
where we asked if a new hospital
could help end the epidemic of cholera.

158
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,394
In this 100-bed hospital,

159
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,093
we designed a simple strategy

160
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:56,577
to clean contaminated medical waste
before it enters the water table,

161
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,609
and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO

162
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,163
are already saving lives because of it.

163
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:02,382
Or Malawi:

164
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:05,635
we asked if a birthing center
could radically reduce

165
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,559
maternal and infant mortality.

166
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:11,145
Malawi has one of the highest rates
of maternal and infant death

167
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,386
in the world.

168
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,733
Using a simple strategy
to be replicated nationally,

169
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,977
we designed a birthing center

170
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,309
that would attract women
and their attendants

171
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,166
to come to the hospital earlier
and therefore have safer births.

172
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,243
Or in the Congo, where we asked

173
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:28,515
if an educational center
could also be used

174
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,721
to protect endangered wildlife.

175
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:32,330
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat

176
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:35,901
is leading to global epidemic,
disease transfer and war.

177
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:39,147
In one of the hardest-to-reach
places in the world,

178
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,097
we used the mud and the dirt
and the wood around us

179
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,785
to construct a center

180
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,557
that would show us ways to protect
and conserve our rich biodiversity.

181
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,131
Even here in the US,

182
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,418
we were asked to rethink

183
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:56,504
the largest university for the deaf
and hard of hearing in the world.

184
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,100
The deaf community, through sign language,

185
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,534
shows us the power
of visual communication.

186
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,810
We designed a campus
that would awaken the ways

187
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,883
in which we as humans all communicate,

188
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,826
both verbally and nonverbally.

189
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,263
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,

190
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,826
we thought about old
industrial infrastructure.

191
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,473
We wondered:

192
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:22,060
Could we use arts and culture
and design to revitalize this city

193
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,706
and other Rust Belt cities
across our nation,

194
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,694
and turn them into centers
for innovation and growth?

195
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:31,550
In each of these projects,
we asked a simple question:

196
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:34,224
What more can architecture do?

197
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,606
And by asking that question,

198
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,372
we were forced to consider
how we could create jobs,

199
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,807
how we could source regionally

200
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:46,057
and how we could invest
in the dignity of the communities

201
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,312
in which we serve.

202
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,206
I have learned

203
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:54,498
that architecture can be
a transformative engine for change.

204
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,790
About a year ago, I read an article

205
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:04,711
about a tireless and intrepid
civil rights leader

206
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,634
named Bryan Stevenson.

207
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:12,420
(Applause)

208
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:17,433
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.

209
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,572
He and his team had been documenting

210
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:24,240
the over 4,000 lynchings
of African-Americans

211
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:26,524
that have happened in the American South.

212
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,699
And they had a plan to mark every county
where these lynchings occurred,

213
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:35,112
and build a national memorial
to the victims of lynching

214
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,826
in Montgomery, Alabama.

215
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,976
Countries like Germany and South Africa

216
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,049
and, of course, Rwanda,

217
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,145
have found it necessary to build memorials

218
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,008
to reflect on the atrocities
of their past,

219
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:52,020
in order to heal their national psyche.

220
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:55,212
We have yet to do this
in the United States.

221
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:03,314
So I sent a cold email
to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:

222
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,287
"Dear Bryan," it said,

223
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,738
"I think your building project

224
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,717
is maybe the most important
project we could do in America

225
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,731
and could change the way
we think about racial injustice.

226
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,624
By any chance,

227
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:18,569
do you know who will design it?"

228
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,222
(Laughter)

229
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:22,511
Surprisingly, shockingly,

230
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:24,861
Bryan got right back to me,

231
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,093
and invited me down to meet
with his team and talk to them.

232
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:30,815
Needless to say,
I canceled all my meetings

233
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,179
and I jumped on a plane
to Montgomery, Alabama.

234
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,361
When I got there,

235
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:38,281
Bryan and his team picked me up,
and we walked around the city.

236
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,632
And they took the time to point out

237
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:43,677
the many markers that have
been placed all over the city

238
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,145
to the history of the Confederacy,

239
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:50,396
and the very few that mark
the history of slavery.

240
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,247
And then he walked me to a hill.

241
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,330
It overlooked the whole city.

242
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,164
He pointed out the river
and the train tracks

243
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,883
where the largest domestic
slave-trading port in America

244
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,091
had once prospered.

245
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:02,733
And then to the Capitol rotunda,

246
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,829
where George Wallace
had stood on its steps

247
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,737
and proclaimed, "Segregation forever."

248
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,056
And then to the very hill below us.

249
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,397
He said, "Here we will build
a new memorial

250
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:17,863
that will change the identity
of this city and of this nation."

251
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:22,309
Our two teams have worked
together over the last year

252
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,975
to design this memorial.

253
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:30,051
The memorial will take us on a journey

254
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,910
through a classical,
almost familiar building type,

255
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:38,059
like the Parthenon
or the colonnade at the Vatican.

256
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:40,321
But as we enter,

257
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:44,306
the ground drops below us
and our perception shifts,

258
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,424
where we realize that these columns
evoke the lynchings,

259
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,479
which happened in the public square.

260
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,321
And as we continue,

261
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,440
we begin to understand the vast number

262
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,457
of those who have yet to be put to rest.

263
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:03,186
Their names will be engraved
on the markers that hang above us.

264
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:08,271
And just outside will be a field
of identical columns.

265
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:12,772
But these are temporary columns,
waiting in purgatory,

266
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:16,619
to be placed in the very counties
where these lynchings occurred.

267
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:20,496
Over the next few years,

268
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,506
this site will bear witness,

269
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,298
as each of these markers is claimed

270
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,581
and visibly placed in those counties.

271
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:33,426
Our nation will begin to heal
from over a century of silence.

272
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,852
When we think about
how it should be built,

273
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,676
we were reminded of Ubudehe,

274
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,068
the building process
we learned about in Rwanda.

275
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:46,106
We wondered if we could fill
those very columns

276
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,029
with the soil from the sites
of where these killings occurred.

277
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:54,382
Brian and his team have begun
collecting that soil

278
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,724
and preserving it in individual jars

279
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:01,207
with family members, community
leaders and descendants.

280
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,992
The act of collecting soil itself

281
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,818
has lead to a type of spiritual healing.

282
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,032
It's an act of restorative justice.

283
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:15,398
As one EJI team member noted

284
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:19,474
in the collection of the soil
from where Will McBride was lynched,

285
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,364
"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,

286
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:24,743
one drop of blood,

287
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:26,576
one hair follicle --

288
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,585
I pray that I dug it up,

289
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,584
and that his whole body
would be at peace."

290
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,944
We plan to break ground
on this memorial later this year,

291
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:42,413
and it will be a place to finally speak
of the unspeakable acts

292
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,292
that have scarred this nation.

293
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,241
(Applause)

294
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,682
When my father told me
that day that this house --

295
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:01,861
our house --

296
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,090
had saved his life,

297
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,282
what I didn't know

298
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:08,558
was that he was referring
to a much deeper relationship

299
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:11,022
between architecture and ourselves.

300
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,995
Buildings are not simply
expressive sculptures.

301
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:19,117
They make visible our personal
and our collective aspirations

302
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,298
as a society.

303
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:24,417
Great architecture can give us hope.

304
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,536
Great architecture can heal.

305
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,695
Thank you very much.

306
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:36,990
(Applause)
