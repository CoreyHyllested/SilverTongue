00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,651
Chris Anderson: You were something
of a mathematical phenom.

1
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:18,739
You had already taught at Harvard
and MIT at a young age.

2
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:20,953
And then the NSA came calling.

3
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:22,668
What was that about?

4
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:27,130
Jim Simons: Well the NSA --
that's the National Security Agency --

5
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:29,123
they didn't exactly come calling.

6
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:33,939
They had an operation at Princeton,
where they hired mathematicians

7
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:36,905
to attack secret codes
and stuff like that.

8
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:38,966
And I knew that existed.

9
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:41,495
And they had a very good policy,

10
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,369
because you could do half your time
at your own mathematics,

11
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:48,877
and at least half your time
working on their stuff.

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,033
And they paid a lot.

13
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:54,108
So that was an irresistible pull.

14
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:56,044
So, I went there.

15
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:57,406
CA: You were a code-cracker.

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,596
JS: I was.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,777
CA: Until you got fired.

18
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:01,384
JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.

19
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,653
CA: How come?

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,613
JS: Well, how come?

21
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,567
I got fired because,
well, the Vietnam War was on,

22
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:16,329
and the boss of bosses in my organization
was a big fan of the war

23
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:20,748
and wrote a New York Times article,
a magazine section cover story,

24
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,542
about how we would win in Vietnam.

25
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,695
And I didn't like that war,
I thought it was stupid.

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,384
And I wrote a letter to the Times,
which they published,

27
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:32,422
saying not everyone
who works for Maxwell Taylor,

28
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:37,132
if anyone remembers that name,
agrees with his views.

29
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,211
And I gave my own views ...

30
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:41,399
CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would --

31
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,978
JS: ... which were different
from General Taylor's.

32
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,908
But in the end, nobody said anything.

33
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:49,633
But then, I was 29 years old at this time,
and some kid came around

34
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,745
and said he was a stringer
from Newsweek magazine

35
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:58,136
and he wanted to interview me
and ask what I was doing about my views.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,059
And I told him, "I'm doing
mostly mathematics now,

37
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,456
and when the war is over,
then I'll do mostly their stuff."

38
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:08,948
Then I did the only
intelligent thing I'd done that day --

39
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:13,129
I told my local boss
that I gave that interview.

40
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:14,612
And he said, "What'd you say?"

41
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,102
And I told him what I said.

42
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:18,441
And then he said,
"I've got to call Taylor."

43
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:20,842
He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.

44
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,128
I was fired five minutes after that.

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,812
CA: OK.

46
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:25,987
JS: But it wasn't bad.

47
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,504
CA: It wasn't bad,
because you went on to Stony Brook

48
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:31,661
and stepped up your mathematical career.

49
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,137
You started working with this man here.

50
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,325
Who is this?

51
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:37,764
JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.

52
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,892
Chern was one of the great
mathematicians of the century.

53
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:46,149
I had known him when
I was a graduate student at Berkeley.

54
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,044
And I had some ideas,

55
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,515
and I brought them to him
and he liked them.

56
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:57,165
Together, we did this work
which you can easily see up there.

57
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,339
There it is.

58
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,804
CA: It led to you publishing
a famous paper together.

59
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:06,066
Can you explain at all what that work was?

60
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,186
JS: No.

61
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,484
(Laughter)

62
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,030
JS: I mean, I could
explain it to somebody.

63
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,129
(Laughter)

64
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,017
CA: How about explaining this?

65
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,770
JS: But not many. Not many people.

66
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,958
CA: I think you told me
it had something to do with spheres,

67
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,844
so let's start here.

68
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:29,468
JS: Well, it did,
but I'll say about that work --

69
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:32,692
it did have something to do with that,
but before we get to that --

70
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:36,256
that work was good mathematics.

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,772
I was very happy with it; so was Chern.

72
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,086
It even started a little sub-field
that's now flourishing.

73
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:49,932
But, more interestingly,
it happened to apply to physics,

74
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:54,251
something we knew nothing about --
at least I knew nothing about physics,

75
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,557
and I don't think Chern
knew a heck of a lot.

76
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:00,544
And about 10 years
after the paper came out,

77
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:05,048
a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton
started applying it to string theory

78
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:09,924
and people in Russia started applying it
to what's called "condensed matter."

79
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:14,841
Today, those things in there
called Chern-Simons invariants

80
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,730
have spread through a lot of physics.

81
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:17,928
And it was amazing.

82
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,317
We didn't know any physics.

83
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,568
It never occurred to me
that it would be applied to physics.

84
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:26,380
But that's the thing about mathematics --
you never know where it's going to go.

85
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,896
CA: This is so incredible.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,284
So, we've been talking about
how evolution shapes human minds

87
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,816
that may or may not perceive the truth.

88
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,153
Somehow, you come up
with a mathematical theory,

89
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,025
not knowing any physics,

90
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:42,547
discover two decades later
that it's being applied

91
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:45,602
to profoundly describe
the actual physical world.

92
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:46,779
How can that happen?

93
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:47,960
JS: God knows.

94
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,094
(Laughter)

95
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,999
But there's a famous physicist
named [Eugene] Wigner,

96
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:59,611
and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics.

97
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:03,587
Somehow, this mathematics,
which is rooted in the real world

98
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:08,606
in some sense -- we learn to count,
measure, everyone would do that --

99
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,460
and then it flourishes on its own.

100
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,817
But so often it comes
back to save the day.

101
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,471
General relativity is an example.

102
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:19,612
[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry,
and Einstein realized,

103
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:23,483
"Hey! It's the very thing
in which I can cast general relativity."

104
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:26,619
So, you never know. It is a mystery.

105
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,273
It is a mystery.

106
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,593
CA: So, here's a mathematical
piece of ingenuity.

107
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,959
Tell us about this.

108
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:38,907
JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere,
and it has a lattice around it --

109
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,504
you know, those squares.

110
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:47,603
What I'm going to show here was
originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,

111
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,881
the great mathematician, in the 1700s.

112
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:55,404
And it gradually grew to be
a very important field in mathematics:

113
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,762
algebraic topology, geometry.

114
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,403
That paper up there had its roots in this.

115
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,261
So, here's this thing:

116
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:09,737
it has eight vertices,
12 edges, six faces.

117
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:13,591
And if you look at the difference --
vertices minus edges plus faces --

118
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:14,767
you get two.

119
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,010
OK, well, two. That's a good number.

120
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:21,282
Here's a different way of doing it --
these are triangles covering --

121
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,883
this has 12 vertices and 30 edges

122
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:30,102
and 20 faces, 20 tiles.

123
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:35,167
And vertices minus edges
plus faces still equals two.

124
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:38,038
And in fact, you could do this
any which way --

125
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:41,460
cover this thing with all kinds
of polygons and triangles

126
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,804
and mix them up.

127
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:46,107
And you take vertices minus edges
plus faces -- you'll get two.

128
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,742
Here's a different shape.

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,730
This is a torus, or the surface
of a doughnut: 16 vertices

130
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:57,998
covered by these rectangles,
32 edges, 16 faces.

131
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,214
Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.

132
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:02,713
It'll always come out to zero.

133
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:07,047
Every time you cover a torus
with squares or triangles

134
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:11,006
or anything like that,
you're going to get zero.

135
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,904
So, this is called
the Euler characteristic.

136
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:18,377
And it's what's called
a topological invariant.

137
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,005
It's pretty amazing.

138
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,820
No matter how you do it,
you're always get the same answer.

139
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:29,143
So that was the first sort of thrust,
from the mid-1700s,

140
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:32,936
into a subject which is now called
algebraic topology.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,943
CA: And your own work
took an idea like this and moved it

142
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,416
into higher-dimensional theory,

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,528
higher-dimensional objects,
and found new invariances?

144
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:46,195
JS: Yes. Well, there were already
higher-dimensional invariants:

145
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:50,676
Pontryagin classes --
actually, there were Chern classes.

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,248
There were a bunch
of these types of invariants.

147
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:58,407
I was struggling to work on one of them

148
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:02,634
and model it sort of combinatorially,

149
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:05,680
instead of the way it was typically done,

150
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:10,063
and that led to this work
and we uncovered some new things.

151
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:13,588
But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --

152
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:17,593
who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics

153
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,348
and had 13 children,

154
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:25,814
who he apparently would dandle on his knee
while he was writing --

155
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:31,612
if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't
perhaps be these invariants.

156
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:36,254
CA: OK, so that's at least given us
a flavor of that amazing mind in there.

157
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,347
Let's talk about Renaissance.

158
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:44,227
Because you took that amazing mind
and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,

159
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:47,480
you started to become a code-cracker
in the financial industry.

160
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,194
I think you probably didn't buy
efficient market theory.

161
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:56,605
Somehow you found a way of creating
astonishing returns over two decades.

162
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,300
The way it's been explained to me,

163
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:01,823
what's remarkable about what you did
wasn't just the size of the returns,

164
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:05,730
it's that you took them
with surprisingly low volatility and risk,

165
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,578
compared with other hedge funds.

166
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,531
So how on earth did you do this, Jim?

167
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:14,182
JS: I did it by assembling
a wonderful group of people.

168
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:18,162
When I started doing trading, I had
gotten a little tired of mathematics.

169
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:22,109
I was in my late 30s,
I had a little money.

170
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,642
I started trading and it went very well.

171
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,811
I made quite a lot of money
with pure luck.

172
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,501
I mean, I think it was pure luck.

173
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,634
It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.

174
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:35,489
But in looking at the data,
after a while I realized:

175
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,066
it looks like there's some structure here.

176
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,787
And I hired a few mathematicians,
and we started making some models --

177
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:46,076
just the kind of thing we did back
at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].

178
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,933
You design an algorithm,
you test it out on a computer.

179
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:51,123
Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.

180
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:52,922
CA: Can we take a look at this?

181
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:57,487
Because here's a typical graph
of some commodity.

182
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:02,528
I look at that, and I say,
"That's just a random, up-and-down walk --

183
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,414
maybe a slight upward trend
over that whole period of time."

184
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,551
How on earth could you trade
looking at that,

185
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:09,901
and see something that wasn't just random?

186
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:13,172
JS: In the old days -- this is
kind of a graph from the old days,

187
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,480
commodities or currencies
had a tendency to trend.

188
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:23,559
Not necessarily the very light trend
you see here, but trending in periods.

189
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,639
And if you decided, OK,
I'm going to predict today,

190
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:32,631
by the average move in the past 20 days --

191
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,762
maybe that would be a good prediction,
and I'd make some money.

192
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:41,394
And in fact, years ago,
such a system would work --

193
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,809
not beautifully, but it would work.

194
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,342
You'd make money, you'd lose
money, you'd make money.

195
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,564
But this is a year's worth of days,

196
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:52,829
and you'd make a little money
during that period.

197
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,842
It's a very vestigial system.

198
00:10:56,525 --> 00:11:00,054
CA: So you would test
a bunch of lengths of trends in time

199
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,514
and see whether, for example,

200
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:06,019
a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend
was predictive of what happened next.

201
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:12,805
JS: Sure, you would try all those things
and see what worked best.

202
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,865
Trend-following would
have been great in the '60s,

203
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,021
and it was sort of OK in the '70s.

204
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,918
By the '80s, it wasn't.

205
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:23,759
CA: Because everyone could see that.

206
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,565
So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?

207
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:33,178
JS: We stayed ahead of the pack
by finding other approaches --

208
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,943
shorter-term approaches to some extent.

209
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:40,454
The real thing was to gather
a tremendous amount of data --

210
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:44,056
and we had to get it by hand
in the early days.

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,546
We went down to the Federal Reserve
and copied interest rate histories

212
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,835
and stuff like that,
because it didn't exist on computers.

213
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,502
We got a lot of data.

214
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:56,686
And very smart people -- that was the key.

215
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:01,239
I didn't really know how to hire
people to do fundamental trading.

216
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:04,698
I had hired a few -- some made money,
some didn't make money.

217
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,602
I couldn't make a business out of that.

218
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,668
But I did know how to hire scientists,

219
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:12,081
because I have some taste
in that department.

220
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,943
So, that's what we did.

221
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,198
And gradually these models
got better and better,

222
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,557
and better and better.

223
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,795
CA: You're credited with doing
something remarkable at Renaissance,

224
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:24,420
which is building this culture,
this group of people,

225
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,586
who weren't just hired guns
who could be lured away by money.

226
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,522
Their motivation was doing
exciting mathematics and science.

227
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,259
JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.

228
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:37,863
But some of it was money.

229
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,280
CA: They made a lot of money.

230
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,841
JS: I can't say that no one came
because of the money.

231
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,118
I think a lot of them
came because of the money.

232
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:46,163
But they also came
because it would be fun.

233
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,675
CA: What role did machine learning
play in all this?

234
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:51,763
JS: In a certain sense,
what we did was machine learning.

235
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,170
You look at a lot of data, and you try
to simulate different predictive schemes,

236
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,376
until you get better and better at it.

237
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,167
It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself
the way we did things.

238
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,500
But it worked.

239
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,209
CA: So these different predictive schemes
can be really quite wild and unexpected.

240
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,147
I mean, you looked at everything, right?

241
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,488
You looked at the weather,
length of dresses, political opinion.

242
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:20,349
JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.

243
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,430
CA: What sort of things?

244
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:23,612
JS: Well, everything.

245
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,900
Everything is grist for the mill --
except hem lengths.

246
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:31,152
Weather, annual reports,

247
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:35,908
quarterly reports, historic data itself,
volumes, you name it.

248
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,083
Whatever there is.

249
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,728
We take in terabytes of data a day.

250
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,876
And store it away and massage it
and get it ready for analysis.

251
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,828
You're looking for anomalies.

252
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,805
You're looking for -- like you said,

253
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,281
the efficient market
hypothesis is not correct.

254
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:55,772
CA: But any one anomaly
might be just a random thing.

255
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:59,454
So, is the secret here to just look
at multiple strange anomalies,

256
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:00,806
and see when they align?

257
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:04,451
JS: Any one anomaly
might be a random thing;

258
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:07,514
however, if you have enough data
you can tell that it's not.

259
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:12,488
You can see an anomaly that's persistent
for a sufficiently long time --

260
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:17,487
the probability of it being
random is not high.

261
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:22,369
But these things fade after a while;
anomalies can get washed out.

262
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,813
So you have to keep on top
of the business.

263
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:27,509
CA: A lot of people look
at the hedge fund industry now

264
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,931
and are sort of ... shocked by it,

265
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,127
by how much wealth is created there,

266
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,396
and how much talent is going into it.

267
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:41,529
Do you have any worries
about that industry,

268
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,967
and perhaps the financial
industry in general?

269
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,695
Kind of being on a runaway train that's --

270
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,749
I don't know --
helping increase inequality?

271
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:54,604
How would you champion what's happening
in the hedge fund industry?

272
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,236
JS: I think in the last
three or four years,

273
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,363
hedge funds have not done especially well.

274
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:00,787
We've done dandy,

275
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:04,812
but the hedge fund industry as a whole
has not done so wonderfully.

276
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:09,738
The stock market has been on a roll,
going up as everybody knows,

277
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:13,207
and price-earnings ratios have grown.

278
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:16,294
So an awful lot of the wealth
that's been created in the last --

279
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:19,668
let's say, five or six years --
has not been created by hedge funds.

280
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,679
People would ask me,
"What's a hedge fund?"

281
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,963
And I'd say, "One and 20."

282
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:29,553
Which means -- now it's two and 20 --

283
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:32,930
it's two percent fixed fee
and 20 percent of profits.

284
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:35,306
Hedge funds are all
different kinds of creatures.

285
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,569
CA: Rumor has it you charge
slightly higher fees than that.

286
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,420
JS: We charged the highest fees
in the world at one time.

287
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:45,670
Five and 44, that's what we charge.

288
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,092
CA: Five and 44.

289
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:50,350
So five percent flat,
44 percent of upside.

290
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:53,157
You still made your investors
spectacular amounts of money.

291
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,633
JS: We made good returns, yes.

292
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:57,657
People got very mad:
"How can you charge such high fees?"

293
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:59,308
I said, "OK, you can withdraw."

294
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,150
But "How can I get more?"
was what people were --

295
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,678
(Laughter)

296
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,142
But at a certain point,
as I think I told you,

297
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:11,341
we bought out all the investors
because there's a capacity to the fund.

298
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,069
CA: But should we worry
about the hedge fund industry

299
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:19,531
attracting too much of the world's
great mathematical and other talent

300
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:22,793
to work on that, as opposed
to the many other problems in the world?

301
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,746
JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.

302
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,449
We hire astronomers and physicists
and things like that.

303
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,264
I don't think we should worry
about it too much.

304
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:33,430
It's still a pretty small industry.

305
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:39,451
And in fact, bringing science
into the investing world

306
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,634
has improved that world.

307
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:45,728
It's reduced volatility.
It's increased liquidity.

308
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:48,941
Spreads are narrower because
people are trading that kind of stuff.

309
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:54,041
So I'm not too worried about Einstein
going off and starting a hedge fund.

310
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:58,642
CA: You're at a phase in your life now
where you're actually investing, though,

311
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,400
at the other end of the supply chain --

312
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:06,528
you're actually boosting
mathematics across America.

313
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:08,417
This is your wife, Marilyn.

314
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:13,197
You're working on
philanthropic issues together.

315
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,384
Tell me about that.

316
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,057
JS: Well, Marilyn started --

317
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,528
there she is up there,
my beautiful wife --

318
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:24,524
she started the foundation
about 20 years ago.

319
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:25,699
I think '94.

320
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,818
I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,

321
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:30,413
but it was one of those two years.

322
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:32,572
(Laughter)

323
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:39,315
We started the foundation,
just as a convenient way to give charity.

324
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,853
She kept the books, and so on.

325
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:49,591
We did not have a vision at that time,
but gradually a vision emerged --

326
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:55,119
which was to focus on math and science,
to focus on basic research.

327
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,341
And that's what we've done.

328
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:04,720
Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance
and went to work at the foundation.

329
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,315
So that's what we do.

330
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:09,248
CA: And so Math for America
is basically investing

331
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,910
in math teachers around the country,

332
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:15,736
giving them some extra income,
giving them support and coaching.

333
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,811
And really trying
to make that more effective

334
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,436
and make that a calling
to which teachers can aspire.

335
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,250
JS: Yeah -- instead of beating up
the bad teachers,

336
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:31,127
which has created morale problems
all through the educational community,

337
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,592
in particular in math and science,

338
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:39,746
we focus on celebrating the good ones
and giving them status.

339
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,701
Yeah, we give them extra money,
15,000 dollars a year.

340
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:47,192
We have 800 math and science teachers
in New York City in public schools today,

341
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,030
as part of a core.

342
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:52,740
There's a great morale among them.

343
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,270
They're staying in the field.

344
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:58,189
Next year, it'll be 1,000
and that'll be 10 percent

345
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:01,757
of the math and science teachers
in New York [City] public schools.

346
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:07,686
(Applause)

347
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,120
CA: Jim, here's another project
that you've supported philanthropically:

348
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:13,541
Research into origins of life, I guess.

349
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,012
What are we looking at here?

350
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,418
JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.

351
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,604
And then I'll tell you
what you're looking at.

352
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,684
Origins of life is a fascinating question.

353
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,241
How did we get here?

354
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,941
Well, there are two questions:

355
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:32,833
One is, what is the route
from geology to biology --

356
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,238
how did we get here?

357
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,626
And the other question is,
what did we start with?

358
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,752
What material, if any,
did we have to work with on this route?

359
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:42,837
Those are two very,
very interesting questions.

360
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:49,607
The first question is a tortuous path
from geology up to RNA

361
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,889
or something like that --
how did that all work?

362
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,301
And the other,
what do we have to work with?

363
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,096
Well, more than we think.

364
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,963
So what's pictured there
is a star in formation.

365
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:05,261
Now, every year in our Milky Way,
which has 100 billion stars,

366
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,780
about two new stars are created.

367
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,274
Don't ask me how, but they're created.

368
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:13,378
And it takes them about a million
years to settle out.

369
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,308
So, in steady state,

370
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:20,180
there are about two million stars
in formation at any time.

371
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:23,662
That one is somewhere
along this settling-down period.

372
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:27,003
And there's all this crap
sort of circling around it,

373
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,525
dust and stuff.

374
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,502
And it'll form probably a solar system,
or whatever it forms.

375
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:34,702
But here's the thing --

376
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:41,074
in this dust that surrounds a forming star

377
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:47,133
have been found, now,
significant organic molecules.

378
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:54,097
Molecules not just like methane,
but formaldehyde and cyanide --

379
00:20:54,121 --> 00:21:00,638
things that are the building blocks --
the seeds, if you will -- of life.

380
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,828
So, that may be typical.

381
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:11,329
And it may be typical
that planets around the universe

382
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,965
start off with some of these
basic building blocks.

383
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,545
Now does that mean
there's going to be life all around?

384
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,933
Maybe.

385
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:24,084
But it's a question
of how tortuous this path is

386
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:28,502
from those frail beginnings,
those seeds, all the way to life.

387
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:33,718
And most of those seeds
will fall on fallow planets.

388
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,151
CA: So for you, personally,

389
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,897
finding an answer to this question
of where we came from,

390
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,579
of how did this thing happen,
that is something you would love to see.

391
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:43,389
JS: Would love to see.

392
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,903
And like to know --

393
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:50,097
if that path is tortuous enough,
and so improbable,

394
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:54,875
that no matter what you start with,
we could be a singularity.

395
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,488
But on the other hand,

396
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:59,990
given all this organic dust
that's floating around,

397
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:03,805
we could have lots of friends out there.

398
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,108
It'd be great to know.

399
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:09,612
CA: Jim, a couple of years ago,
I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,

400
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:12,473
and I asked him the secret of his success,

401
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,188
and he said taking
physics seriously was it.

402
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:20,699
Listening to you, what I hear you saying
is taking math seriously,

403
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:23,726
that has infused your whole life.

404
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:28,686
It's made you an absolute fortune,
and now it's allowing you to invest

405
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,206
in the futures of thousands and thousands
of kids across America and elsewhere.

406
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,425
Could it be that science actually works?

407
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,221
That math actually works?

408
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:43,617
JS: Well, math certainly works.
Math certainly works.

409
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:44,839
But this has been fun.

410
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:49,809
Working with Marilyn and giving it away
has been very enjoyable.

411
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,769
CA: I just find it --
it's an inspirational thought to me,

412
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:56,800
that by taking knowledge seriously,
so much more can come from it.

413
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,842
So thank you for your amazing life,
and for coming here to TED.

414
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,617
Thank you.

415
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:01,752
Jim Simons!

416
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:06,186
(Applause)
