0
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:14,892
This is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."

1
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,963
It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel,"
which I did on Broadway,

2
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:21,333
and this one, I -- thank you --

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,995
I've excerpted it just for you,
so here we go.

4
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,901
Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain

5
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:37,618
all electronic devices are switched off
before we begin.

6
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:43,375
So class, hopefully you'll recognize
what you just heard me say as the -- ?

7
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,199
Very good, the cellular
phone announcement.

8
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,378
Right? This was also known
as a mobile phone.

9
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,607
So you'll remember, people of that era

10
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:58,483
would have had an external
electronic device, right,

11
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:00,434
something like this,

12
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:03,370
and they all would have carried
one of these around with them,

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,749
and amongst their biggest fears
was the sheer mortification

14
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:10,139
that one of these might ring
at some inopportune moment.

15
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,540
Right? So a bit of trivia
about that era for you.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,100
(Laughter)

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,851
So the format of today's class is

18
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:21,793
I will be presenting multiple
BERT modules today

19
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:24,163
from that period in history, right,

20
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,973
so starting circa 2016.

21
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:31,320
And remember, this was
the very first year of the BERT program.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,690
So we've got quite a few
of these to get through.

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,697
Bear in mind, I will be living
into various different bodies,

24
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,875
different ages,

25
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,403
also what were then called races,
or ethnic groups,

26
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,493
as you'll remember from Unit 1.

27
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:48,813
And -- (Laughter) -- and along
the gender continuum,

28
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:51,321
I will be living into males as well.

29
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,991
It was quite binary at that time.

30
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,550
(Laughter)

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,867
Also, don't forget, we are reading
the book module

32
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,842
for next week's focus on gender.

33
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:03,885
Now, I know some of you
have requested the book in pill form.

34
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:08,201
I know people still believe
ingesting it is better for retention,

35
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:13,700
but since we are trying to experience
what our forebears did, right,

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,207
let's please just consider doing
the actual ocular reading, okay?

37
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:24,222
And also, how many people
have your emotional shunts engaged?

38
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,916
Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?

39
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:31,861
I know it's challenging, but I want you
to be able to feel the entire

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,719
natural emo range, all right?

41
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,528
It is essential to this
part of the syllabus.

42
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,126
Yes, Macy?

43
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:43,627
All right. I understand.
If you're unwilling to --

44
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,996
All right, well, we can discuss
that after class.

45
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,429
All right, we will discuss your concerns.

46
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:52,549
Just relax. Nobody's died
and gone to composting.

47
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,893
Okay. After class. Okay? After class.

48
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,144
Let's just get started, okay.

49
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:05,552
This first subject identified
as a middle-class homemaker.

50
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,851
Remember, these early modules

51
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:11,984
in these people's full identities
were protected,

52
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,200
and this allowed them to speak
more freely on our topic,

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,133
which for many of them was taboo.

54
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,732
Okay honey, now,
I'm ready when you are.

55
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:26,960
No, sweetheart, I said,
I'm ready when you are.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,351
I'm freezing.

57
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,206
It's like a meat locker in here
in this recording studio.

58
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,806
I should have brought a shmata.

59
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:39,405
All this fancy technology
but they can't afford heat.

60
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,678
What is he saying? I can't hear you!

61
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,557
I can't hear you
through the glass, honey!

62
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,320
There you are in my ear.

63
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,920
Oh, you can hear me?

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,778
The whole time.

65
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:56,864
Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.

66
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,553
Yes, oh the cold is for the machines,
the new technology. Okay.

67
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:09,304
Yes, now remind me again, you're recording
not only my voice but my feelings

68
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,604
and my memories? Right.

69
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,433
Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.

70
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,484
Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.

71
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:22,641
Right, right, so people will be able
to feel my experience

72
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,543
and my memory? Okay.

73
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,958
No, right, I'm ready.

74
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:30,055
I just thought you were going to give me
a test to see how my memory's doing.

75
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:33,272
I was going to tell you you're too late,
it's already bad news.

76
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:37,648
No, no, go ahead, honey.

77
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,984
Oh, that's the first question?

78
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:43,258
What do I think of prostitution?

79
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:46,599
Are you soliciting me, young man?

80
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:51,955
I've heard of May-December romances,
but what are you, about 20 years old?

81
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,844
Eighteen? Eighteen years.

82
00:04:54,844 --> 00:05:00,463
I think I have candies in my purse
older than 18 years old.

83
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:01,941
(Laughter)

84
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:08,520
I'm teasing you, sweetheart.
No, I'm comfortable with any question.

85
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,371
Sure. So about the prostitution --
oh, sex worker, sex worker.

86
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,920
No, just in my day, they called it
prostitution, not sex work.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,666
Oh, because it includes pornography also?

88
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,477
Okay.

89
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,659
No, well, I guess when I was a girl,

90
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,167
we didn't really have
a name for that either.

91
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:34,902
We would have said dirty magazines,
I suppose, or dirty movies.

92
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,370
Well, it's not like what you have
with the Internet.

93
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,636
No, well, I don't mind sharing.

94
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:46,628
My late husband and I,
we were a very romantic couple.

95
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,714
Lots of tenderness, you understand.

96
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:55,164
Well, as you get older, you know,
at one point I thought my husband

97
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:59,317
might be helped by using
some of the pills men can take,

98
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:04,413
but he wasn't interested in those,

99
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:10,474
so I thought, what about maybe
watching an adult movie on the Internet?

100
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,908
Just for inspiration, you understand.

101
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:18,906
Well, at the time, neither of us
were very good on the computer,

102
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:21,619
so usually, if we needed help
with the Internet,

103
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:26,597
we would just call our children
or our grandchildren,

104
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:30,163
but obviously, in this case,
that wasn't an option,

105
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:35,588
so I thought, I'll have
a look myself, just to see.

106
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:38,127
How difficult could it be?

107
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,760
You search for certain key words
and you look --

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,955
Oh wow is right, young man.

109
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,672
You can't imagine what I saw.

110
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:51,618
Well, first of all, I was just trying
to find, you know, couples,

111
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,963
normal couples making love,

112
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:59,791
but this, so many people
together at one time.

113
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,599
You couldn't tell which part
belonged to which body.

114
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,778
How they even got the cameras to
capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.

115
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:12,608
But the one thing they didn't capture
was making love.

116
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:19,388
There was lots of making of something,

117
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:23,497
but they took the love part
right out of it, you know, the fun.

118
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:27,421
It was all very extreme, you know?

119
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:29,929
Like you would say,
with the extreme sports.

120
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:34,778
Lots of endurance,

121
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,800
but never tenderness.

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,116
So anyway, needless to say,
that was $19,95 I'll never get back again,

123
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:48,945
but it only showed up on the credit card
as "entertainment services,"

124
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:51,732
so my husband was never the wiser,

125
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,083
and after all of that,

126
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,572
well, you could say it turned out

127
00:07:57,572 --> 00:08:01,412
he didn't need the extra
inspiration after all.

128
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:06,734
Right, so next subject is a young woman
-- (Applause) --

129
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:10,957
Next subject, class,
is a young woman called Bella,

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,904
a university student interviewed in 2016

131
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,828
during what was called
an Intro to Feminist Porn class

132
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:23,317
as part of her major in sex work
at a college in the Bay Area.

133
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:26,672
(Laughter)

134
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,439
Yeah, I just want to, like,
get a recording of, like,

135
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,808
you guys recording me,

136
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,897
like a meta recording, or whatever.

137
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:38,611
It's just like this whole experience
is just, like, really amazing,

138
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:42,131
and I'd like to capture that
for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.

139
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:45,126
So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,

140
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,633
and I am, like, being
interviewed right now

141
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:55,505
for this, like, really amazing
Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,

142
00:08:55,505 --> 00:09:01,780
which is, like, basically where they are,
like, recording, as you can see

143
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,702
from these, whatever, like, electrodes,

144
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:09,040
the formation of, like, neuropeptides
in my hippocampus, or whatever.

145
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,920
They will later be able
to reconstitute these

146
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,280
as, like, my own actual memory,
like actual experiences,

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,645
so other people can, like,
actually feel what I'm feeling right now.

148
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,572
Okay. Okay.

149
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:32,140
So, like, hello, BERT person of the future
who is experiencing me.

150
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,557
This is what it feels like to be,
like, a college freshman,

151
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:41,781
and also the, like, headache
that you are experiencing through me

152
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:48,200
is the, like, residual effect
of the Jell-O shots which I had last night

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,115
at the bi-weekly feminist
pole dancing party

154
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:54,157
which I cohost on Wednesdays.

155
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,779
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" --
(Laughter) --

156
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,122
and it's in Beekman Hall,

157
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:04,250
and, what else, like,

158
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,297
non-Jell-O shots are also
available for vegans,

159
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:16,540
and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we
should also focus on your questions also.

160
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,182
So for your record, I am, like,
a sex work studies major

161
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,457
but minoring in social media

162
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,151
with a concentration
on notable YouTube memes.

163
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,289
(Laughter)

164
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:33,490
Yes, well, of course, like,
I consider myself to be, like,

165
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,579
obviously, like, a feminist.

166
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:40,571
I was named for Bella Abzug,
who was, like, a famous, like,

167
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,986
feminist from history,

168
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:49,255
and, like, also I feel that it is, like,
important to, like, represent women

169
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:52,945
who are, like, sex-positive feminists.

170
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,941
What is sex-negative?

171
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,399
Well, like, I guess I would ask,
like, what do you think

172
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,417
sex-negative is? (Laughter)

173
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:09,314
Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use
are, like, so important, because, like,

174
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:16,352
we call it sex work because it helps
people understand that, like, it's work,

175
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:21,228
and, like, you know, just like there are,
like, healthcare providers

176
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,712
and, like, insurance providers,

177
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:29,401
like, we think of these workers
as, like, sex care providers.

178
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:34,184
Yeah, but like, I don't think of myself
like, providing direct

179
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:38,433
sex care services per se as, like,
being a requirement

180
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,894
for me to be, like, an advocate.

181
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:44,563
Like, I support other women's right
to choose it voluntarily, like,

182
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,676
if they enjoy it.

183
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:49,509
Yeah, but, like, I see
myself going forward

184
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,247
as more likely, like,
protecting sex workers',

185
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,288
like, legal freedoms and rights.

186
00:11:56,288 --> 00:12:00,213
Yeah, so, like, basically,
I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.

187
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,835
Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause)

188
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:07,921
So these next two modules
are also circa 2016.

189
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:11,915
One subject is an Irishwoman
with a particularly noteworthy

190
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,847
relationship to this issue,

191
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:18,509
but first will be a West Indian woman,

192
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,831
a self-described escort

193
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:26,241
who was recorded at a
sex workers' rights rally and parade.

194
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:30,792
She was interviewed whilst marching
in full carnival headdress

195
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,460
and very little else.

196
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,379
All right, you want me
to start talking now.

197
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,509
Yeah, I told you, you can
put those wires anywhere you want to

198
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,536
as long as it don't get in the way.

199
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,069
Yeah, no, but, tell me again
what the name of -- BERT? BERT.

200
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,108
Yeah, I was telling you, you know,
I think I have in all my time

201
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,797
I have had at least one client with that
name, so this won't be the first time

202
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:59,396
I had BERT all over me.

203
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,218
Oh, I'm sorry,

204
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,670
but you got to get into the spirit of it
if you're going to interview me.

205
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,536
All right? You can say it.

206
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,934
No justice, no piece!
No justice, no piece!

207
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:18,878
But you see the sign? You get it?
P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.

208
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,790
You understand?

209
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,244
Right, so that's the part
where I was telling you

210
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:27,609
is that when I first came to this country,
I worked every job I could find.

211
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:32,299
I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant
for all these different old people,

212
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,422
and then I said, child, if I have to touch
another white man's backside,

213
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,381
I might as well get paid
a lot more money for it than this,

214
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:41,285
you understand?

215
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:44,350
Pshh, you know how hard it is
being a domestic worker?

216
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,729
Some of these men, they're heavy.

217
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:49,528
You have to pick them up
and flip them over.

218
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,986
Now, I let them pick me up
and flip me over, you understand?

219
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:57,399
Well, you have to have a sense of humor
about it, that's what I think.

220
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,349
No, but see, listen,

221
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:02,739
you find me somebody who don't hate
some part of their job.

222
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,502
I mean, there's a lot of things
about this job that I hate,

223
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,072
but the money is not one of them,

224
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,891
and I will tell you, as long as this
is the best possibility

225
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,655
for me to make real money,

226
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:15,811
I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin'
if that's what they want to call me.

227
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,318
No, I'm not even from Jamaica.
That's how they market me.

228
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,545
My family is from Trinidad
and the Virgin Islands.

229
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,711
They don't know what I do,
but you know what?

230
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,977
My children, they know
that their school fees are paid,

231
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:31,484
they have their books and their computer,

232
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:34,456
and this way, I know
that they have a chance.

233
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,266
So I'm not going to tell you
that what I do, it's easy,

234
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,818
I'm not going to tell you that I feel --
what's that you said, liberated?

235
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,920
But I'm going to tell you
that I feel paid.

236
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,129
Right. (Applause)

237
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:53,496
Thanks, that's lovely,
and just the cup of tea, love,

238
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:55,470
and just a splash of the whiskey.

239
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,200
It's perfect, that's grand.
Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.

240
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,550
What was your name? Peter?
Is that right, so, Peter?

241
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,708
Right. So that, that is
the unique part of it for me,

242
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,401
right, is that I ended up in both,

243
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:14,550
first in the convent, and then
in the prostitution after. That's right.

244
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,160
(Laughter)

245
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,120
So one woman at the university
here in Dublin, she wrote about me.

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,820
She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living
embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.

247
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,341
Right? (Laughter)

248
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:30,359
Doesn't it sound like something
you need to go into hospital?

249
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,248
Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.

250
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,411
Doesn't it.

251
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:37,119
Right. Well, for me though, it was,
as a girl, it started with me dad.

252
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:40,394
I mean, half the time, when he
spoke to us, it was just a sort of

253
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:44,856
tell us we were all useless rotten idiots
and we had no morals, that type of thing.

254
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:48,177
And I certainly didn't
do myself any favors.

255
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,406
By the time I was 16,

256
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,285
I had started messing about
with this older fella,

257
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,837
and he wanted it to be
our little secret,

258
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,345
and I did as I was told, didn't I,

259
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:05,452
and when that got back to me dad, he
had me sent straightaway to the convent.

260
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:10,420
Well no, that older fella, he would still
come to find me in the convent.

261
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,766
Yeah, he'd leave me notes

262
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:16,001
tucked into the holes in the brick
at the back of the charity shop

263
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,188
so we could meet.

264
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:20,915
And he'd tell me how
he's leaving his wife,

265
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:25,141
and I believed him, until I got pregnant.

266
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:30,458
I did, Peter, and I left him a note
about it in our special place there,

267
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,477
and I never did hear from him again.

268
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:38,490
No, I gave it up for adoption
so it could have a decent life,

269
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,675
and then they wouldn't let me
back into the convent.

270
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,273
No, my one sister Virginia gave me
a fiver for the coach to Dublin,

271
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,221
and that's how I ended up here.

272
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love
with another fella much older than me,

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,159
and I always say I was just so happy
because he didn't drink,

274
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,502
I married the bastard.

275
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:06,184
Well, he didn't drink, but he did have
just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,

276
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:09,279
and -- That's right, and before I knew it,

277
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,903
he was the one who turned me on
to the prostitution, my own husband.

278
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:15,771
He had me supporting the both of us.

279
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,314
I was 18.

280
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:21,089
Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman,
I can tell you that.

281
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,356
That Julia Roberts,

282
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:29,569
if she'd ever had to sleep with a man
to put a few pounds in her pocket,

283
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:32,110
I don't think she'd ever
have made that film.

284
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,339
Well, for your record,

285
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:37,520
my opinion of the legalization,
I'd say I'm against it.

286
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,864
I just, I don't care what
these young girls say.

287
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:43,975
You know, living like that,
you're just lost,

288
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,483
and, you know, I'm 63 years old.

289
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,523
I'm still trying to find who I am.

290
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:53,240
You know, I never was a wife or a nun,

291
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,560
or a prostitute even, really, not really.

292
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,648
Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.

293
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,482
They just told me,

294
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:03,433
and if you legalize it,

295
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:07,264
then you're really telling these girls,
"Go on and get lost for a living,"

296
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,872
and a lot of them,
they'll do as they're told.

297
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:15,669
All right, so four perspectives
from four quite -- (Applause) --

298
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,829
four quite different voices there, right?

299
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:22,146
One woman saying sex itself is natural
but the sex industry seems to

300
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:24,794
mechanize or industrialize it.

301
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:29,162
Then the second woman considered
sex work to be empowering,

302
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:32,991
liberating, and feminist,
though she, herself, notably,

303
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,568
did not seem keen to do it.

304
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:39,995
The third woman, who actually was
a so-called sex worker

305
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:43,340
did not agree that it was liberating
but she wanted the right

306
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,100
to the economic empowerment,

307
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,412
and then we hear the fourth woman
saying not only prostitution itself

308
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,938
but proscribed roles for women in general

309
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:54,398
prevented her from ever
finding who she was, right?

310
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,395
So another fact most people did not know

311
00:18:56,395 --> 00:19:02,080
was the average age of an at-risk girl
being introduced to the sex industry

312
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,110
was 12 or 13.

313
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,146
Also consider that the age
when all girls in that society

314
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,791
first became exposed
to sexualized images of women

315
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,345
was quite a bit earlier, right?

316
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:18,105
This was a doll called Barbie, right?

317
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,692
I initially thought she was an educational
tool for anorexia prevention --

318
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:22,842
(Laughter) --

319
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:26,209
but actually she was considered by many

320
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:30,272
to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,

321
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:33,615
and often young girls began
what was called dieting.

322
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:37,854
Remember this? This was
restricting food intake on purpose

323
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,234
by the age of six,

324
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:42,061
and defining themselves
based on attractiveness

325
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,901
by around that same time. Right?

326
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,112
Yes?

327
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,756
Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.

328
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:52,585
So there was a lucrative market
in that society in convincing all people

329
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:56,463
they had to look a certain way
to even have a sex life, right?

330
00:19:56,463 --> 00:20:01,618
But girls, especially, were expected
to be "sexy" while avoiding

331
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,970
being perceived as "sluts"
for being sexual. Right?

332
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,237
So there's that shame piece
we've heard about.

333
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,839
Yes.

334
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,696
Valerie, right? Okay, very good.

335
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,506
Of course, men were having sex as well,

336
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:15,944
but you'll remember from the reading,

337
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:17,625
what were male sluts called?

338
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,541
Very good, they were called men.

339
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,747
(Laughter) (Applause)

340
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:28,319
So not easy living in
a world like that, right?

341
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,711
Though it was not all bad news either.

342
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:34,217
Most women in the early 2000s
considered themselves empowered,

343
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:38,450
and men generally felt they were
also evolved in this area,

344
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,300
and, in fact, most people would have
been aware of issues

345
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,235
like human trafficking, for example,

346
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,636
but they would have seen that
as quite separate

347
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:48,427
from more recreational
adult entertainment.

348
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,850
And so we'll just very briefly, class --
we don't have a lot of time --

349
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,065
we'll just very briefly hear from a man

350
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:55,839
on our topic at this stage.

351
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,474
So this next subject was interviewed
on the night of his bachelor party.

352
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:06,979
Dude, can you, all right,
can you just keep it down?

353
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,185
I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.

354
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,778
Oh, your name's not BERT.

355
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,573
BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.

356
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,638
No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine.
I'm mostly sober,

357
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:19,473
so I just want to be helpful.

358
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:23,892
Yeah, and I totally believe in causes,
yeah, like, all that stuff.

359
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,332
(Laughter)

360
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,714
And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.

361
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,560
Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,

362
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,887
like, you buy a pair and then
a kid in Africa gets clean water.

363
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,394
Yeah. Totally.

364
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:41,181
But what was the question again? Sorry.

365
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:45,889
Of course I believe in women's rights.
I'm marrying a woman.

366
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,389
(Laughter)

367
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:52,018
No, but I mean, like, just because
I'm in a strip club parking lot

368
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:55,042
doesn't mean that I'm, like,
a sexist or whatever.

369
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:59,454
My fiancee is totally amazing,
she's totally a strong girl, woman,

370
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:01,949
smart woman, like, the whole thing.

371
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:05,518
Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably
at a strip club herself right now,

372
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,510
like, as a joke, same as me.

373
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,602
My best man, I told him
he could surprise me,

374
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,597
and he thought this would be hilarious,

375
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,700
but this is not something.

376
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,720
Yeah, we all went to B school together.

377
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,540
Wharton.

378
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,724
(Laughter)

379
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,171
Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --

380
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,087
All right, but it's my bachelor party,

381
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:27,595
and I can spend it in the parking lot
with Anderson Cooper if I want to.

382
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,266
All right, I'll see you in there.

383
00:22:31,076 --> 00:22:33,214
All right, okay, so Anderson,

384
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:37,111
so, like, first of all, stripping,

385
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:39,895
but then, like, all the other things
you're talking about,

386
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:43,403
prostitution and all that stuff,
that's, like, not the same thing at all.

387
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,659
You know? Like, you keep calling it
the sex industry or whatever,

388
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:50,605
but it's like, if the girl wants
to be an exotic dancer

389
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,072
and she's 18, like, that's her right.

390
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:58,340
Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying,
but I just feel like people,

391
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,976
they just want to make it seem
like all dudes are just, like, predators,

392
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:05,114
that we would just automatically
go to a prostitute, or whatever.

393
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:09,410
Even, like, when I pledged, you know,
like when I rushed my fraternity.

394
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,337
My brothers who I'm close to,
those guys, they're all like me.

395
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:17,290
We're just normal people, but, like,
there's this myth that you must

396
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,928
be that guy who is kind of an asshole,
and like, all bros before hos or whatever.

397
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:25,643
And actually, like, bros before hos,
it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.

398
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:30,380
It's actually just like a joking way of
saying that you care about your brothers

399
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,516
and you put them first.

400
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,576
Yeah, but, you can't blame
the media, either.

401
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:38,110
I mean, like, if you
go watch "Hangover 2,"

402
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,264
and you think that's an instruction manual

403
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,800
for your life, like,
I don't know what to tell you.

404
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,862
You know? You don't
watch "Bourne Identity"

405
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:49,106
and go drive your car
over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)

406
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:52,672
Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're
a little kid or whatever,

407
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,876
of course it's different, but --

408
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:58,570
Yeah, all right, I remember
one thing like that.

409
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,480
I was at this kid's house
one time playing GTA,

410
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,510
uh, Grand Theft Auto?

411
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,123
Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)

412
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:12,986
So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,

413
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:16,160
you're this kid, like, you're this guy
walking around or whatever,

414
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,092
and you can basically, like,
the more cops you kill,

415
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:21,763
the more points you get,
and stuff like that.

416
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:24,601
But also, you can find prostitutes

417
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:27,798
and obviously you can do
sexual stuff with them,

418
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,655
but you can, like, kill them
and take your money back.

419
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:36,466
Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran over
a couple of them a few times with his car

420
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,320
and he got all these points.

421
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,755
We were, like, 10, I think.

422
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:45,777
It felt pretty terrible, actually.

423
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:52,215
No, I don't think I said anything,
I just finished playing and went home.

424
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,770
All right class, so then there were men
who had more than just

425
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,135
a passing relationship to this issue.
(Laughter)

426
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:04,880
The next subject described himself
as a reformed and remorseful pimp

427
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,526
turned motivational speaker,

428
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,964
life coach and therapist,

429
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:12,934
but if you want to know more about him,
you'll have to come to the entire play.

430
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:16,920
Thank you so much,
you beautiful TED audience.

431
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,716
I will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."

432
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:24,287
(Applause)
