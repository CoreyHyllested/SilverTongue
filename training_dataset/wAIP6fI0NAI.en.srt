00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:17,439
In the early days of Twitter,
it was like a place of radical de-shaming.

1
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:20,411
People would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

2
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:24,929
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

3
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:27,755
Voiceless people realized
that they had a voice,

4
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,734
and it was powerful and eloquent.

5
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:35,527
If a newspaper ran some racist
or homophobic column,

6
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,942
we realized we could do
something about it.

7
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,335
We could get them.

8
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,811
We could hit them with a weapon
that we understood but they didn't --

9
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,010
a social media shaming.

10
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:48,496
Advertisers would withdraw
their advertising.

11
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,943
When powerful people
misused their privilege,

12
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,630
we were going to get them.

13
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:57,092
This was like the
democratization of justice.

14
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,519
Hierarchies were being leveled out.

15
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,541
We were going to do things better.

16
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:06,964
Soon after that, a disgraced
pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --

17
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:10,123
he'd been caught plagiarizing
and faking quotes,

18
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:13,879
and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.

19
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,394
And he had the opportunity

20
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:19,248
to publicly apologize
at a foundation lunch.

21
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:22,203
This was going to be the most
important speech of his life.

22
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:24,511
Maybe it would win him some salvation.

23
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,443
He knew before he arrived

24
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:29,546
that the foundation was going to be
live-streaming his event,

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,594
but what he didn't know
until he turned up,

26
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,546
was that they'd erected a giant screen
Twitter feed right next to his head.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,062
(Laughter)

28
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:40,629
Another one in a monitor screen
in his eye line.

29
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,089
I don't think the foundation did this
because they were monstrous.

30
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:47,267
I think they were clueless:
I think this was a unique moment

31
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,828
when the beautiful naivety of Twitter

32
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:53,161
was hitting the increasingly
horrific reality.

33
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,160
And here were some of the Tweets
that were cascading into his eye line,

34
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,910
as he was trying to apologize:

35
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:02,196
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us
into forgiving him."

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,295
(Laughter)

37
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,787
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven
that he is capable of feeling shame."

38
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:12,280
That one must have been written
by the best psychiatrist ever,

39
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:15,779
to know that about such
a tiny figure behind a lectern.

40
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,152
And, "Jonah Lehrer is just
a frigging sociopath."

41
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:25,274
That last word is a very human thing
to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.

42
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:29,475
It's because we want to destroy people
but not feel bad about it.

43
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:32,951
Imagine if this was an actual court,

44
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,801
and the accused was in the dark,
begging for another chance,

45
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,566
and the jury was yelling out,

46
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,277
"Bored! Sociopath!"

47
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,442
(Laughter)

48
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:44,485
You know, when we watch
courtroom dramas, we tend to identify

49
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,480
with the kindhearted defense attorney,

50
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,010
but give us the power,
and we become like hanging judges.

51
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,819
Power shifts fast.

52
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:58,780
We were getting Jonah because he was
perceived to have misused his privilege,

53
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,087
but Jonah was on the floor then,
and we were still kicking,

54
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,893
and congratulating ourselves
for punching up.

55
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:09,933
And it began to feel weird and empty
when there wasn't a powerful person

56
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,975
who had misused their privilege
that we could get.

57
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:16,634
A day without a shaming
began to feel like a day

58
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:19,585
picking fingernails and treading water.

59
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,783
Let me tell you a story.

60
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,982
It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,744
She was a PR woman from New York
with 170 Twitter followers,

62
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:33,724
and she'd Tweet little
acerbic jokes to them,

63
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:37,371
like this one on a plane
from New York to London:

64
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:40,906
[Weird German Dude: You're in first class.
It's 2014. Get some deodorant."

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,032
-Inner monologue as inhale BO.
Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]

66
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,319
So Justine chuckled to herself,
and pressed send, and got no replies,

67
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,404
and felt that sad feeling that we all feel

68
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:53,062
when the Internet doesn't
congratulate us for being funny.

69
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,257
(Laughter)

70
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,404
Black silence when the Internet
doesn't talk back.

71
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,182
And then she got to Heathrow,
and she had a little time to spare

72
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:05,982
before her final leg, so she thought up
another funny little acerbic joke:

73
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:10,328
[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS.
Just kidding. I'm white!]

74
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:16,478
And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,
got on the plane, got no replies,

75
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:19,085
turned off her phone, fell asleep,

76
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,098
woke up 11 hours later,

77
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:24,716
turned on her phone while the plane
was taxiing on the runway,

78
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,097
and straightaway there was
a message from somebody

79
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:29,217
that she hadn't spoken
to since high school,

80
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:33,988
that said, "I am so sorry
to see what's happening to you."

81
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:37,793
And then another message
from a best friend,

82
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,831
"You need to call me right now.

83
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:43,868
You are the worldwide number one
trending topic on Twitter."

84
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,602
(Laughter)

85
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:49,704
What had happened is that one
of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet

86
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:54,628
to a Gawker journalist, and he
retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:

87
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:57,872
[And now, a funny holiday joke
from IAC's PR boss]

88
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,859
And then it was like a bolt of lightning.

89
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,385
A few weeks later, I talked
to the Gawker journalist.

90
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,097
I emailed him and asked him how it felt,
and he said, "It felt delicious."

91
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:09,003
And then he said,
"But I'm sure she's fine."

92
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,761
But she wasn't fine,
because while she slept,

93
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:18,269
Twitter took control of her life
and dismantled it piece by piece.

94
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:21,542
First there were the philanthropists:

95
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:24,048
[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate
words ... bother you,

96
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,219
join me in supporting
@CARE's work in Africa.]

97
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,032
[In light of ... disgusting,
racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]

98
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,547
Then came the beyond horrified:

99
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,587
[... no words for that horribly disgusting
racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.

100
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:36,762
I am beyond horrified.]

101
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,039
Was anybody on Twitter
that night? A few of you.

102
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:42,533
Did Justine's joke overwhelm
your Twitter feed the way it did mine?

103
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:45,449
It did mine, and I thought
what everybody thought that night,

104
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:48,561
which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!

105
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,925
Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"

106
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,257
And I sat up in my bed,

107
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:55,205
and I put the pillow behind my head,

108
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,476
and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure
that joke was intended to be racist.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,262
Maybe instead of gleefully
flaunting her privilege,

110
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:05,886
she was mocking the gleeful
flaunting of privilege.

111
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,723
There's a comedy tradition of this,

112
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,435
like South Park or Colbert
or Randy Newman.

113
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,904
Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being
as good at it as Randy Newman.

114
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:19,364
In fact, when I met Justine
a couple of weeks later in a bar,

115
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,477
she was just crushed,

116
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,450
and I asked her to explain the joke,

117
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:27,109
and she said, "Living in America
puts us in a bit of a bubble

118
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,627
when it comes to what is going on
in the Third World.

119
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,848
I was making of fun of that bubble."

120
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,734
You know, another woman on Twitter that
night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,

121
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:40,406
she reviewed my book on public shaming
and wrote that she Tweeted that night,

122
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,720
"I'm not sure that her joke
was intended to be racist,"

123
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,483
and she said straightaway she got
a fury of Tweets saying,

124
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,960
"Well, you're just
a privileged bitch, too."

125
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,220
And so to her shame, she wrote,

126
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,776
she shut up and watched
as Justine's life got torn apart.

127
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:59,506
It started to get darker:

128
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,440
[Everyone go report
this cunt @JustineSacco]

129
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,050
Then came the calls for her to be fired.

130
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,946
[Good luck with the job hunt
in the new year. #GettingFired]

131
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,705
Thousands of people around the world

132
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,256
decided it was their duty
to get her fired.

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,450
[@JustineSacco last tweet
of your career. #SorryNotSorry

134
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:20,337
Corporations got involved,
hoping to sell their products

135
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,718
on the back of Justine's annihilation:

136
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,959
[Next time you plan to tweet something
stupid before you take off,

137
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,134
make sure you are getting
on a @Gogo flight!]

138
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,564
(Laughter)

139
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:33,194
A lot of companies were making
good money that night.

140
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:37,135
You know, Justine's name was normally
Googled 40 times a month.

141
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,487
That month, between December the 20th
and the end of December,

142
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:45,264
her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.

143
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:49,418
And one Internet economist told me
that that meant that Google made

144
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:54,452
somewhere between 120,000 dollars
and 468,000 dollars

145
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:58,542
from Justine's annihilation, whereas
those of us doing the actual shaming --

146
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,720
we got nothing.

147
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,744
(Laughter)

148
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:04,218
We were like unpaid
shaming interns for Google.

149
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,529
(Laughter)

150
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,949
And then came the trolls:

151
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,704
[I'm actually kind of hoping
Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]

152
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,134
Somebody else on that wrote,

153
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,407
"Somebody HIV-positive should rape
this bitch and then we'll find out

154
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,510
if her skin color protects her from AIDS."

155
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,113
And that person got a free pass.

156
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,224
Nobody went after that person.

157
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:26,883
We were all so excited
about destroying Justine,

158
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,534
and our shaming brains
are so simple-minded,

159
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,943
that we couldn't also handle
destroying somebody

160
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,904
who was inappropriately
destroying Justine.

161
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:39,223
Justine was really uniting
a lot of disparate groups that night,

162
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:42,183
from philanthropists to "rape the bitch."

163
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,506
[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!
You demented bitch...

164
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,118
Just let the world know you're planning
to ride bare back while in Africa.]

165
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:52,167
Women always have it worse than men.

166
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:55,292
When a man gets shamed, it's,
"I'm going to get you fired."

167
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,014
When a woman gets shamed, it's,

168
00:08:57,038 --> 00:09:01,919
"I'm going to get you fired
and raped and cut out your uterus."

169
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:04,352
And then Justine's employers got involved:

170
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:07,682
[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an
outrageous, offensive comment.

171
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,680
Employee in question currently
unreachable on an intl flight.]

172
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,902
And that's when the anger
turned to excitement:

173
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:16,548
[All I want for Christmas is to see
@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands

174
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,573
and she checks
her inbox/voicemail. #fired]

175
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:21,288
[Oh man, @justinesacco
is going to have the most painful

176
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,711
phone-turning-on moment ever
when her plane lands.]

177
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:27,151
[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco
bitch get fired. In REAL time.

178
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,199
Before she even KNOWS
she's getting fired.]

179
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:31,236
What we had was
a delightful narrative arc.

180
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,085
We knew something that Justine didn't.

181
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:35,450
Can you think of anything
less judicial than this?

182
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,351
Justine was asleep on a plane
and unable to explain herself,

183
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,938
and her inability was
a huge part of the hilarity.

184
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,917
On Twitter that night, we were
like toddlers crawling towards a gun.

185
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,794
Somebody worked out exactly
which plane she was on, so they linked

186
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:52,917
to a flight tracker website.

187
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:56,053
[British Airways Flight 43
On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]

188
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:58,532
A hashtag began trending worldwide:

189
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,158
# hasJustineLandedYet?

190
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,348
[It is kinda wild
to see someone self-destruct

191
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:06,095
without them even being aware of it.
#hasJustineLandedYet]

192
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,513
[Seriously. I just want to go home
to go to bed, but everyone at the bar

193
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:12,497
is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.
Can't look away. Can't leave.]

194
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:16,007
[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best
thing to happen to my Friday night.]

195
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:19,134
[Is no one in Cape Town going
to the airport to tweet her arrival?

196
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,877
Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures]

197
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:22,417
And guess what? Yes there was.

198
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:25,307
[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed
at Cape Town international.

199
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:27,863
And if you want to know
what it looks like to discover

200
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,462
that you've just been torn to shreds
because of a misconstrued liberal joke,

201
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,494
not by trolls, but by nice people like us,

202
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:35,064
this is what it looks like:

203
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,742
[... She's decided to wear
sunnies as a disguise.]

204
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,219
So why did we do it?

205
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,834
I think some people were genuinely upset,

206
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,286
but I think for other people,

207
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,333
it's because Twitter is basically
a mutual approval machine.

208
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:50,276
We surround ourselves with people
who feel the same way we do,

209
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,563
and we approve each other,

210
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,238
and that's a really good feeling.

211
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:55,910
And if somebody gets in the way,
we screen them out.

212
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,021
And do you know what
that's the opposite of?

213
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:59,786
It's the opposite of democracy.

214
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:04,333
We wanted to show that we cared
about people dying of AIDS in Africa.

215
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:08,364
Our desire to be seen to be compassionate
is what led us to commit

216
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:11,433
this profoundly un-compassionate act.

217
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,417
As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote
in the Boston Review,

218
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:18,852
"This isn't social justice.
It's a cathartic alternative."

219
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,885
For the past three years,

220
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,187
I've been going around the world
meeting people like Justine Sacco --

221
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:26,995
and believe me, there's a lot
of people like Justine Sacco.

222
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,725
There's more every day.

223
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:32,041
And we want to think they're fine,
but they're not fine.

224
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:34,200
The people I met were mangled.

225
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:36,065
They talked to me about depression,

226
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,005
and anxiety and insomnia
and suicidal thoughts.

227
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,768
One woman I talked to,
who also told a joke that landed badly,

228
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,006
she stayed home for a year and a half.

229
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:51,869
Before that, she worked with adults
with learning difficulties,

230
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:54,331
and was apparently really good at her job.

231
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:59,175
Justine was fired, of course,
because social media demanded it.

232
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,351
But it was worse than that.

233
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,334
She was losing herself.

234
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:07,418
She was waking up in the middle
of the night, forgetting who she was.

235
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,035
She was got because she was perceived
to have misused her privilege.

236
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,620
And of course, that's a much better thing
to get people for than the things

237
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:18,804
we used to get people for,
like having children out of wedlock.

238
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,659
But the phrase "misuse of privilege"
is becoming a free pass

239
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:25,111
to tear apart pretty much
anybody we choose to.

240
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,441
It's becoming a devalued term,

241
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:30,450
and it's making us lose
our capacity for empathy

242
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:35,394
and for distinguishing between serious
and unserious transgressions.

243
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,863
Justine had 170 Twitter followers,
and so to make it work,

244
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,856
she had to be fictionalized.

245
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,695
Word got around that she was the daughter
the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.

246
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,343
[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco
her father is a SA mining billionaire.

247
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,422
She's not sorry.
And neither is her father.]

248
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,269
I thought that was true about Justine,

249
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:57,631
until I met her at a bar, and I asked her
about her billionaire father,

250
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:59,568
and she said, "My father sells carpets."

251
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,749
And I think back on
the early days of Twitter,

252
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,503
when people would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

253
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:07,453
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

254
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:11,650
These days, the hunt is on
for people's shameful secrets.

255
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,716
You can lead a good, ethical life,

256
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,174
but some bad phraseology in a Tweet
can overwhelm it all,

257
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,182
become a clue to your secret inner evil.

258
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:24,236
Maybe there's two types
of people in the world:

259
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,787
those people who favor
humans over ideology,

260
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:30,717
and those people who favor
ideology over humans.

261
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,755
I favor humans over ideology,

262
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,540
but right now, the ideologues are winning,

263
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:41,234
and they're creating a stage
for constant artificial high dramas

264
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,686
where everybody's either
a magnificent hero

265
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,318
or a sickening villain,

266
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:48,359
even though we know that's not true
about our fellow humans.

267
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:52,369
What's true is that
we are clever and stupid;

268
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:55,579
what's true is that we're grey areas.

269
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,481
The great thing about social media
was how it gave a voice

270
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,901
to voiceless people,

271
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,579
but we're now creating
a surveillance society,

272
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:06,953
where the smartest way to survive
is to go back to being voiceless.

273
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,856
Let's not do that.

274
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,032
Thank you.

275
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:15,774
(Applause)

276
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,895
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.

277
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,165
Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.

278
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,363
BG: Don't go away.

279
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,734
What strikes me about Justine's story

280
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:31,191
is also the fact that if you
Google her name today,

281
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,962
this story covers the first
100 pages of Google results --

282
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,198
there is nothing else about her.

283
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:38,810
In your book, you mention another story

284
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:43,365
of another victim who actually got
taken on by a reputation management firm,

285
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:48,473
and by creating blogs and posting nice,
innocuous stories about her love for cats

286
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:51,213
and holidays and stuff,
managed to get the story

287
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:55,160
off the first couple pages of Google
results, but it didn't last long.

288
00:14:55,184 --> 00:15:00,137
A couple of weeks later, they started
creeping back up to the top result.

289
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,109
Is this a totally lost battle?

290
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,317
Jon Ronson: You know, I think
the very best thing we can do,

291
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:09,915
if you see a kind of unfair
or an ambiguous shaming,

292
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,339
is to speak up, because I think
the worst thing that happened to Justine

293
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,379
was that nobody supported her --
like, everyone was against her,

294
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,128
and that is profoundly traumatizing,

295
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:21,974
to be told by tens of thousands of people
that you need to get out.

296
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:26,088
But if a shaming happens and there's
a babble of voices, like in a democracy,

297
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:29,208
where people are discussing it,
I think that's much less damaging.

298
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,859
So I think that's the way forward,

299
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,479
but it's hard, because if you do
stand up for somebody,

300
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,199
it's incredibly unpleasant.

301
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,143
BG: So let's talk about your experience,

302
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,175
because you stood up by writing this book.

303
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,788
By the way, it's mandatory
reading for everybody, okay?

304
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:46,122
You stood up because the book
actually puts the spotlight on shamers.

305
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,178
And I assume you didn't only
have friendly reactions on Twitter.

306
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:51,882
JR: It didn't go down that well
with some people.

307
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:52,907
(Laughter)

308
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,035
I mean, you don't want
to just concentrate --

309
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,456
because lots of people understood,
and were really nice about the book.

310
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,833
But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing
stories about abuses of power,

311
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:05,137
and when I say the powerful people
over there in the military,

312
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:07,929
or in the pharmaceutical industry,
everybody applauds me.

313
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:12,328
As soon as I say, "We are the powerful
people abusing our power now,"

314
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:15,076
I get people saying,
"Well you must be a racist too."

315
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,775
BG: So the other night --
yesterday -- we were at dinner,

316
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,714
and there were two discussions going on.

317
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:22,786
On one side you were talking
with people around the table --

318
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,973
and that was a nice,
constructive discussion.

319
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,344
On the other, every time
you turned to your phone,

320
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,929
there is this deluge of insults.

321
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:32,344
JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
We had like a TED dinner last night.

322
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:36,168
We were chatting and it was lovely
and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.

323
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,312
Somebody said, "You are
a white supremacist."

324
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,310
And then I went back and had
a nice conversation with somebody,

325
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,875
and then I went back to Twitter,

326
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,987
somebody said my very existence
made the world a worse place.

327
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,758
My friend Adam Curtis says

328
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:52,590
that maybe the Internet is like
a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,

329
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:55,655
when eventually everyone
will start screaming at each other

330
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,209
and shooting each other,
and then eventually everybody

331
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,229
would flee to somewhere safer,

332
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,153
and I'm starting to think of that
as a really nice option.

333
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,130
BG: Jon, thank you.
JR: Thank you, Bruno.

334
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:10,152
(Applause)
