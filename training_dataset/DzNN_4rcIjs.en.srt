00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,603
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.

1
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:19,077
You live on a small farm
in the Philippines.

2
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:22,760
Your animals are your family's
sole source of income --

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,685
as long as they're healthy.

4
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:26,079
You know that any day,

5
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:28,323
one of your pigs can catch the flu,

6
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:29,694
the swine flu.

7
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:32,989
Living in tight quarters,
one pig coughing and sneezing

8
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:35,953
may soon lead to the next pig
coughing and sneezing,

9
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:39,352
until an outbreak of swine flu
has taken over your farm.

10
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:41,530
If it's a bad enough virus,

11
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:44,726
the health of your herd may be gone
in the blink of an eye.

12
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:46,900
If you called in a veterinarian,

13
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:49,407
he or she would visit your farm
and take samples

14
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:51,255
from your pigs' noses and mouths.

15
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:54,106
But then they would have to drive
back into the city

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,929
to test those samples
in their central lab.

17
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:00,159
Two weeks later,
you'd hear back the results.

18
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,687
Two weeks may be just enough time
for infection to spread

19
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,799
and take away your way of life.

20
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:09,387
But it doesn't have to be that way.

21
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,668
Today, farmers can take
those samples themselves.

22
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:16,439
They can jump right into the pen
and swab their pigs' noses and mouths

23
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:18,264
with a little filter paper,

24
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:21,501
place that little filter paper
in a tiny tube,

25
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:25,406
and mix it with some chemicals
that will extract genetic material

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,343
from their pigs' noses and mouths.

27
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,292
And without leaving their farms,

28
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:31,614
they take a drop of that genetic material

29
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:35,429
and put it into a little analyzer
smaller than a shoebox,

30
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:40,473
program it to detect DNA or RNA
from the swine flu virus,

31
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:44,655
and within one hour get back the results,
visualize the results.

32
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,203
This reality is possible

33
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:51,148
because today we're living in the era
of personal DNA technology.

34
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:54,874
Every one of us can actually
test DNA ourselves.

35
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,187
DNA is the fundamental molecule
the carries genetic instructions

36
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,251
that help build the living world.

37
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,306
Humans have DNA.

38
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,386
Pigs have DNA.

39
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,904
Even bacteria and some
viruses have DNA too.

40
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:13,152
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
inform how our bodies develop,

41
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,884
grow, function.

42
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,525
And in many cases, that same information
can trigger disease.

43
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,686
Your genetic information

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,400
is strung into a long and twisted
molecule, the DNA double helix,

45
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,872
that has over three billion letters,

46
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,460
beginning to end.

47
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:31,704
But the lines that carry
meaningful information

48
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:33,293
are usually very short --

49
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:36,339
a few dozen to several
thousand letters long.

50
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:39,510
So when we're looking to answer
a question based on DNA,

51
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,467
we actually don't need to read

52
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,960
all those three billion
letters, typically.

53
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:46,221
That would be like getting hungry at night

54
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,635
and having to flip through
the whole phone book

55
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,914
from cover to cover,

56
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,513
pausing at every line,

57
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,522
just to find the nearest pizza joint.

58
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:54,698
(Laughter)

59
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:57,259
Luckily, three decades ago,

60
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,211
humans started to invent tools

61
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:02,742
that can find any specific line
of genetic information.

62
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,955
These DNA machines are wonderful.

63
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,708
They can find any line in DNA.

64
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,036
But once they find it,

65
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,511
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
by so much other DNA,

66
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:19,177
that what these machines then do
is copy the target gene,

67
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,442
and one copy piles on top of another,

68
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:23,631
millions and millions
and millions of copies,

69
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:26,641
until that gene stands out
against the rest;

70
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,848
until we can visualize it,

71
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:31,415
interpret it, read it, understand it,

72
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,717
until we can answer:

73
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,848
Does my pig have the flu?

74
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:39,411
Or other questions buried in our own DNA:

75
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,347
Am I at risk of cancer?

76
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,204
Am I of Irish descent?

77
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,813
Is that child my son?

78
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,846
(Laughter)

79
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:55,211
This ability to make copies of DNA,
as simple as it sounds,

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,526
has transformed our world.

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,562
Scientists use it every day
to detect and address disease,

82
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,074
to create innovative medicines,

83
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,134
to modify foods,

84
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,134
to assess whether our food is safe to eat

85
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,554
or whether it's contaminated
with deadly bacteria.

86
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,422
Even judges use the output
of these machines in court

87
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:19,020
to decide whether someone is innocent
or guilty based on DNA evidence.

88
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:21,457
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique

89
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:25,285
was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1993.

90
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:26,983
But for 30 years,

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,840
the power of genetic analysis
has been confined to the ivory tower,

92
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,704
or bigwig PhD scientist work.

93
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,435
Well, several companies around the world

94
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,307
are working on making
this same technology accessible

95
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,362
to everyday people like the pig farmer,

96
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:44,735
like you.

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,343
I cofounded one of these companies.

98
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,518
Three years ago,

99
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,529
together with a fellow biologist
and friend of mine,

100
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,133
Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,

101
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,772
we decided to make personal DNA machines

102
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,513
that anyone could use.

103
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:01,535
Our goal was to bring DNA science
to more people in new places.

104
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,053
We started working in our basements.

105
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,130
We had a simple question:

106
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:07,905
What could the world look like

107
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,356
if everyone could analyze DNA?

108
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,642
We were curious,

109
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:17,068
as curious as you would have been
if I had shown you this picture in 1980.

110
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,377
(Laughter)

111
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,192
You would have thought, "Wow!

112
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,819
I can now call
my Aunt Glenda from the car

113
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,729
and wish her a happy birthday.

114
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,728
I can call anyone, anytime.

115
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:28,675
This is the future!"

116
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,257
Little did you know,

117
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,886
you would tap on that phone
to make dinner reservations

118
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,334
for you and Aunt Glenda
to celebrate together.

119
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,888
With another tap,
you'd be ordering her gift.

120
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:40,394
And yet one more tap,

121
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,730
and you'd be "liking"
Auntie Glenda on Facebook.

122
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:45,098
And all of this,
while sitting on the toilet.

123
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,296
(Laughter)

124
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,583
It is notoriously hard to predict
where new technology might take us.

125
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:57,016
And the same is true
for personal DNA technology today.

126
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,109
For example, I could never have imagined

127
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,654
that a truffle farmer, of all people,

128
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,767
would use personal DNA machines.

129
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,558
Dr. Paul Thomas grows
truffles for a living.

130
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,289
We see him pictured here,

131
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:15,409
holding the first UK-cultivated truffle
in his hands, on one of his farms.

132
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,675
Truffles are this delicacy

133
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,762
that stems from a fungus
growing on the roots of living trees.

134
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,413
And it's a rare fungus.

135
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:28,749
Some species may fetch 3,000,
7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.

136
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,361
I learned from Paul

137
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,272
that the stakes for a truffle farmer
can be really high.

138
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:37,510
When he sources new truffles
to grow on his farms,

139
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:40,062
he's exposed to the threat
of knockoffs --

140
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:43,542
truffles that look and feel
like the real thing,

141
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,068
but they're of lower quality.

142
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:47,521
But even to a trained eye like Paul's,

143
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,627
even when looked at under a microscope,

144
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,802
these truffles can pass for authentic.

145
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:55,752
So in order to grow
the highest quality truffles,

146
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:59,015
the ones that chefs
all over the world will fight over,

147
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,899
Paul has to use DNA analysis.

148
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,340
Isn't that mind-blowing?

149
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,664
I bet you will never look
at that black truffle risotto again

150
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,358
without thinking of its genes.

151
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,932
(Laughter)

152
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,815
But personal DNA machines
can also save human lives.

153
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:21,565
Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist
at the University of Cambridge.

154
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,910
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.

155
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:28,189
When the Ebola outbreak
broke out in Western Africa,

156
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:32,025
he quickly realized that doctors there
lacked the basic tools

157
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:33,707
to detect and combat disease.

158
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,250
Results could take
up to a week to come back --

159
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:42,133
that's way too long for the patients
and the families who are suffering.

160
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:46,651
Ian decided to move his lab
into Makeni, Sierra Leone.

161
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,319
Here we see Ian Goodfellow

162
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,411
moving over 10 tons of equipment
into a pop-up tent

163
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:57,111
that he would equip to detect
and diagnose the virus

164
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,861
and sequence it within 24 hours.

165
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,029
But here's a surprise:

166
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:06,175
the same equipment that Ian could use
at his lab in the UK

167
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,790
to sequence and diagnose Ebola,

168
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:10,947
just wouldn't work under these conditions.

169
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,705
We're talking 35 Celsius heat
and over 90 percent humidity here.

170
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:19,037
But instead, Ian could use
personal DNA machines

171
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,411
small enough to be placed
in front of the air-conditioning unit

172
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,366
to keep sequencing the virus

173
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,965
and keep saving lives.

174
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,026
This may seem like
an extreme place for DNA analysis,

175
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,826
but let's move on to an even
more extreme environment:

176
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,165
outer space.

177
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,935
Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.

178
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:40,777
When astronauts live aboard
the International Space Station,

179
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,424
they're orbiting the planet
250 miles high.

180
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:47,250
They're traveling
at 17,000 miles per hour.

181
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:48,432
Picture that --

182
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:52,331
you're seeing 15 sunsets
and sunrises every day.

183
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,689
You're also living in microgravity,

184
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:55,881
floating.

185
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,067
And under these conditions,
our bodies can do funky things.

186
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:03,833
One of these things is that
our immune systems get suppressed,

187
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,452
making astronauts more prone to infection.

188
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,769
A 16-year-old girl,

189
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,624
a high school student from New York,
Anna-Sophia Boguraev,

190
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:16,517
wondered whether changes
to the DNA of astronauts

191
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,964
could be related
to this immune suppression,

192
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:22,357
and through a science competition
called "Genes In Space,"

193
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:26,288
Anna-Sophia designed an experiment
to test this hypothesis

194
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:30,468
using a personal DNA machine
aboard the International Space Station.

195
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:37,162
Here we see Anna-Sophia
on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,

196
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:41,249
watching her experiment launch
to the International Space Station.

197
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,804
That cloud of smoke is the rocket

198
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:48,523
that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment
to the International Space Station,

199
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,476
where, three days later,

200
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,248
astronaut Tim Peake
carried out her experiment --

201
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:55,494
in microgravity.

202
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,931
Personal DNA machines are now
aboard the International Space Station,

203
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,542
where they can help monitor
living conditions

204
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,660
and protect the lives of astronauts.

205
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,779
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment

206
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,716
to protect the lives of astronauts

207
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,302
may seem like a rarity,
the mark of a child genius.

208
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:18,354
Well, to me, it signals
something bigger:

209
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:23,531
that DNA technology is finally
within the reach of every one of you.

210
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,706
A few years ago,

211
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,913
a college student armed
with a personal computer

212
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,088
could code an app,

213
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:35,488
an app that is now a social network
with more than one billion users.

214
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,893
Could we be moving into a world

215
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,188
of one personal DNA machine in every home?

216
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,347
I know families who are already
living in this reality.

217
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,665
The Daniels family, for example,

218
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:52,535
set up a DNA lab in the basement
of their suburban Chicago home.

219
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:56,107
This is not a family
made of PhD scientists.

220
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,766
This is a family like any other.

221
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,845
They just like to spend time together
doing fun, creative things.

222
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:06,732
By day, Brian is an executive
at a private equity firm.

223
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,042
At night and on weekends,
he experiments with DNA

224
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,963
alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,

225
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:15,091
as a way to explore the living world.

226
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,154
Last time I called them,

227
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:21,066
they were checking out homegrown produce
from the backyard garden.

228
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,387
They were testing tomatoes
that they had picked,

229
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,191
taking the flesh of their skin,
putting it in a test tube,

230
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,297
mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA

231
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,799
and then using their home DNA copier

232
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:35,746
to test those tomatoes
for genetically engineered traits.

233
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,410
For the Daniels family,

234
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:41,333
the personal DNA machine
is like the chemistry set

235
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:42,684
for the 21st century.

236
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,237
Most of us may not yet
be diagnosing genetic conditions

237
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,607
in our kitchen sinks

238
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:51,341
or doing at-home paternity testing.

239
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,390
(Laughter)

240
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,634
But we've definitely reached
a point in history

241
00:11:54,658 --> 00:12:00,467
where every one of you could actually
get hands-on with DNA

242
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,922
in your kitchen.

243
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:05,133
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA

244
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,688
and extract meaningful
information from it.

245
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,251
And it's at times like this
that profound transformation

246
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,874
is bound to happen;

247
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,150
moments when a transformative,
powerful technology

248
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:19,796
that was before limited
to a select few in the ivory tower,

249
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,293
finally becomes within the reach
of every one of us,

250
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,142
from farmers to schoolchildren.

251
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:27,939
Think about the moment

252
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,840
when phones stopped being
plugged into the wall by cords,

253
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:34,159
or when computers left the mainframe

254
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:36,796
and entered your home or your office.

255
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,397
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution

256
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,948
may be hard to predict,

257
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:43,589
but one thing is certain:

258
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:46,005
revolutions don't go backwards,

259
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,294
and DNA technology is already spreading
faster than our imagination.

260
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:52,217
So if you're curious,

261
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,456
get up close and personal
with DNA -- today.

262
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,071
It is in our DNA to be curious.

263
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,110
(Laughter)

264
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,294
Thank you.

265
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:03,632
(Applause)
