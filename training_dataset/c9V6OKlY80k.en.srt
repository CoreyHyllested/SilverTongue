0
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
So, this is a story

1
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,833
about how we know what we know.

2
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,825
It's a story about this woman,

3
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,547
Natalia Rybczynski.

4
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:24,960
She's a paleobiologist,

5
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,813
which means she specializes
in digging up really old dead stuff.

6
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:32,339
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,
I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."

7
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:34,992
Latif Nasser: And I think
she's particularly interesting

8
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:36,930
because of where she digs that stuff up,

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,149
way above the Arctic Circle
in the remote Canadian tundra.

10
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:44,956
Now, one summer day in 2006,

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,171
she was at a dig site called
the Fyles Leaf Bed,

12
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:52,773
which is less than 10 degrees latitude
away from the magnetic north pole.

13
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,524
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not
going to sound very exciting,

14
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:59,578
because it was a day of walking
with your backpack and your GPS

15
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:03,680
and notebook and just picking up
anything that might be a fossil.

16
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:06,379
LN: And at some point,
she noticed something.

17
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:08,570
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,

18
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:10,529
about the size of the palm of my hand.

19
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:12,847
It was just lying on the surface.

20
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:16,323
LN: And at first she thought
it was just a splinter of wood,

21
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,640
because that's the sort of thing
people had found

22
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:22,083
at the Fyles Leaf Bed before --
prehistoric plant parts.

23
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,575
But that night, back at camp ...

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,869
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,

25
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:29,290
I'm looking a little bit
more closely and realizing

26
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,718
it doesn't quite look
like this has tree rings.

27
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,306
Maybe it's a preservation thing,

28
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,604
but it looks really like ...

29
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,829
bone.

30
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,742
LN: Huh. So over the next four years,

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,700
she went to that spot over and over,

32
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:48,260
and eventually collected 30 fragments
of that exact same bone,

33
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:49,945
most of them really tiny.

34
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:54,958
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.
It fits in a small Ziploc bag.

35
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,339
LN: And she tried to piece them
together like a jigsaw puzzle.

36
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,386
But it was challenging.

37
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,230
(Audio) NR: It's broken up
into so many little tiny pieces,

38
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:07,512
I'm trying to use sand and putty,
and it's not looking good.

39
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:12,703
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.

40
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:14,316
LN: Ooh!
NR: Yeah, right?

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,780
(Laughter)

42
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:18,547
LN: It turns out it was way easier
to do it virtually.

43
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,341
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical
when it all fits together.

44
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,564
LN: How certain were you
that you had it right,

45
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:25,733
that you had put it together
in the right way?

46
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:28,771
Was there a potential that you'd
put it together a different way

47
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,737
and have, like, a parakeet or something?

48
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,126
(Laughter)

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,790
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.
No, we got this.

50
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:40,083
LN: What she had, she discovered,
was a tibia, a leg bone,

51
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:44,107
and specifically, one that belonged
to a cloven-hoofed mammal,

52
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,980
so something like a cow or a sheep.

53
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:49,464
But it couldn't have been either of those.

54
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,271
It was just too big.

55
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:55,886
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing,
it was huge. It's a really big animal.

56
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,768
LN: So what animal could it be?

57
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,871
Having hit a wall, she showed
one of the fragments

58
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,467
to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

59
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,751
and they had an idea.

60
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:11,291
(Audio) NR: We took a saw,
and we nicked just the edge of it,

61
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:17,706
and there was this really interesting
smell that comes from it.

62
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,284
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.

63
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:23,941
It was a smell that Natalia recognized

64
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:27,908
from cutting up skulls
in her gross anatomy lab:

65
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,096
collagen.

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,777
Collagen is what gives
structure to our bones.

67
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,959
And usually, after so many years,

68
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,134
it breaks down.

69
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,506
But in this case, the Arctic had acted
like a natural freezer and preserved it.

70
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,813
Then a year or two later,
Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,

71
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:47,031
and she saw that a colleague
of hers named Mike Buckley

72
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:52,895
was demoing this new process
that he called "collagen fingerprinting."

73
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:56,927
It turns out that different species
have slightly different structures

74
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,103
of collagen,

75
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:00,943
so if you get a collagen profile
of an unknown bone,

76
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,161
you can compare it
to those of known species,

77
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:05,723
and, who knows, maybe you get a match.

78
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,825
So she shipped him one of the fragments,

79
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,143
FedEx.

80
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,977
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.
It's kind of important.

81
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,254
(Laughter)

82
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,469
LN: And he processed it,

83
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:21,855
and compared it to 37 known
and modern-day mammal species.

84
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,951
And he found a match.

85
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:29,436
It turns out that
the 3,5 million-year-old bone

86
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,090
that Natalia had dug
out of the High Arctic

87
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:34,923
belonged to ...

88
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,348
a camel.

89
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,103
(Laughter)

90
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:43,425
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?
That's amazing -- if it's true.

91
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,501
LN: So they tested
a bunch of the fragments,

92
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,769
and they got the same result for each one.

93
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:53,617
However, based on the size
of the bone that they found,

94
00:04:53,641 --> 00:05:00,004
it meant that this camel was 30 percent
larger than modern-day camels.

95
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:03,218
So this camel would have been
about nine feet tall,

96
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:04,440
weighed around a ton.

97
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:05,515
(Audience reacts)

98
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,588
Yeah.

99
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:10,105
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.

100
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,271
(Laughter)

101
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,714
Now, when you hear the word "camel,"

102
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:20,663
what may come to mind is one of these,

103
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:24,871
the Bactrian camel
of East and Central Asia.

104
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:28,380
But chances are the postcard image
you have in your brain

105
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,959
is one of these, the dromedary,

106
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,411
quintessential desert creature --

107
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:38,754
hangs out in sandy, hot places
like the Middle East and the Sahara,

108
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,258
has a big old hump on its back

109
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:42,799
for storing water
for those long desert treks,

110
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:46,204
has big, broad feet to help it
tromp over sand dunes.

111
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,930
So how on earth would one of these guys
end up in the High Arctic?

112
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,506
Well, scientists have known
for a long time, turns out,

113
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,092
even before Natalia's discovery,

114
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:04,734
that camels are actually
originally American.

115
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:10,458
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)

116
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:11,941
(Laughter)

117
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,496
They started here.

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,354
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years
that camels have been around,

119
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,537
you could only find them in North America,

120
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,814
around 20 different species, maybe more.

121
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:28,083
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,
would they look different?

122
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,542
NR: Yeah, you're going to have
different body sizes.

123
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,478
You'll have some with really long necks,

124
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,747
so they're actually
functionally like giraffes.

125
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,417
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.

126
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:42,025
(Audio) NR: The really primitive,
early ones would have been really small,

127
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,552
almost like rabbits.

128
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,423
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?

129
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:48,884
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.

130
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,143
So those ones you probably
would not recognize.

131
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,357
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.

132
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,425
(Audio) NR: I know,
wouldn't that be great?

133
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,621
(Laughter)

134
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,304
LN: And then about three
to seven million years ago,

135
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:02,136
one branch of camels
went down to South America,

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,114
where they became llamas and alpacas,

137
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,060
and another branch crossed over
the Bering Land Bridge

138
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,520
into Asia and Africa.

139
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,965
And then around the end
of the last ice age,

140
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:15,088
North American camels went extinct.

141
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,313
So, scientists knew all of that already,

142
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:24,413
but it still doesn't fully explain
how Natalia found one so far north.

143
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:29,111
Like, this is, temperature-wise,
the polar opposite of the Sahara.

144
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,636
Now to be fair,

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,343
three and a half million years ago,

146
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,466
it was on average 22 degrees Celsius
warmer than it is now.

147
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,425
So it would have been boreal forest,

148
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,363
so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.

149
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:48,559
But still, like, they would have
six-month-long winters

150
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,806
where the ponds would freeze over.

151
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,298
You'd have blizzards.

152
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:55,933
You'd have 24 hours a day
of straight darkness.

153
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,938
Like, how ... How?

154
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:03,120
How is it that one of these
Saharan superstars

155
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:06,375
could ever have survived
those arctic conditions?

156
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,375
(Laughter)

157
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,087
Natalia and her colleagues
think they have an answer.

158
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,642
And it's kind of brilliant.

159
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,233
What if the very features that we imagine
make the camel so well-suited

160
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:25,225
to places like the Sahara,

161
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,661
actually evolved to help it
get through the winter?

162
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:34,145
What if those broad feet were meant
to tromp not over sand,

163
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,189
but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?

164
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,593
What if that hump --
which, huge news to me,

165
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:42,991
does not contain water, it contains fat --

166
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,594
(Laughter)

167
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:48,219
was there to help the camel
get through that six-month-long winter,

168
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,920
when food was scarce?

169
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:53,657
And then, only later, long after
it crossed over the land bridge

170
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:58,099
did it retrofit those winter features
for a hot desert environment?

171
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:02,197
Like, for instance, the hump
may be helpful to camels in hotter climes

172
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:04,693
because having all your fat in one place,

173
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:07,458
like a, you know, fat backpack,

174
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:10,010
means that you don't have
to have that insulation

175
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,793
all over the rest of your body.

176
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,067
So it helps heat dissipate easier.

177
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,396
It's this crazy idea,

178
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,967
that what seems like proof of the camel's
quintessential desert nature

179
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:26,691
could actually be proof
of its High Arctic past.

180
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:31,542
Now, I'm not the first person
to tell this story.

181
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:36,516
Others have told it as a way
to marvel at evolutionary biology

182
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,893
or as a keyhole into the future
of climate change.

183
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,092
But I love it for a totally
different reason.

184
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,513
For me, it's a story about us,

185
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:48,505
about how we see the world

186
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,833
and about how that changes.

187
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,030
So I was trained as a historian.

188
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,307
And I've learned that, actually,
a lot of scientists are historians, too.

189
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,880
They make sense of the past.

190
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:06,229
They tell the history of our universe,
of our planet, of life on this planet.

191
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,218
And as a historian,

192
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:12,613
you start with an idea in your mind
of how the story goes.

193
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,681
(Audio) NR: We make up stories
and we stick with it,

194
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,427
like the camel in the desert, right?

195
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,897
That's a great story!
It's totally adapted for that.

196
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,150
Clearly, it always lived there.

197
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:26,476
LN: But at any moment, you could
uncover some tiny bit of evidence.

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,699
You could learn some tiny thing

199
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:32,682
that forces you to reframe
everything you thought you knew.

200
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,484
Like, in this case, this one scientist
finds this one shard

201
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,255
of what she thought was wood,

202
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,317
and because of that, science has a totally
new and totally counterintuitive theory

203
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,956
about why this absurd
Dr. Seuss-looking creature

204
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,512
looks the way it does.

205
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:53,940
And for me, it completely upended
the way I think of the camel.

206
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:58,346
It went from being
this ridiculously niche creature

207
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,719
suited only to this
one specific environment,

208
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:06,031
to being this world traveler
that just happens to be in the Sahara,

209
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:09,180
and could end up virtually anywhere.

210
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,855
(Applause)

211
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,854
This is Azuri.

212
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,469
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?

213
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,041
OK, here, I've got
one of these for you here.

214
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:36,111
(Laughter)

215
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:40,318
So Azuri is on a break
from her regular gig

216
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,565
at the Radio City Music Hall.

217
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,738
(Laughter)

218
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,344
That's not even a joke.

219
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,454
Anyway --

220
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:52,835
But really, Azuri is here
as a living reminder

221
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:57,106
that the story of our world
is a dynamic one.

222
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,837
It requires our willingness
to readjust, to reimagine.

223
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:06,138
(Laughter)

224
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:07,613
Right, Azuri?

225
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:14,053
And, really, that we're all
just one shard of bone away

226
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,307
from seeing the world anew.

227
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,086
Thank you very much.

228
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,531
(Applause)
