0
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,349
Why do we cheat?

1
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,928
And why do happy people cheat?

2
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,447
And when we say "infidelity,"
what exactly do we mean?

3
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:32,586
Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room,

4
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,625
a massage with a happy ending?

5
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:41,494
Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

6
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:46,256
but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy?

7
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:51,999
And is an affair always
the end of a relationship?

8
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:56,490
For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,535
and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples

10
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:01,722
who have been shattered by infidelity.

11
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,602
There is one simple act of transgression

12
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,990
that can rob a couple
of their relationship,

13
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:15,245
their happiness and their
very identity: an affair.

14
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:21,117
And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood.

15
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:27,224
So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved.

16
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:33,525
Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented,

17
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,070
and so, too, the taboo against it.

18
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:42,827
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy,

19
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:46,285
so much so, that this is
the only commandment

20
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:50,221
that is repeated twice in the Bible:

21
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:54,325
once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it.

22
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,595
(Laughter)

23
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,922
So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden,

24
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,367
yet universally practiced?

25
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:10,036
Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat

26
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:12,331
with little consequence,

27
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:16,739
and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories

28
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,315
that justified their need to roam,

29
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:23,292
so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself.

30
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:29,716
But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right?

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,752
Because when it comes to sex,

32
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,939
the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate,

33
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,484
but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny,

34
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:45,710
which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries

35
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,234
where women can be killed for straying.

36
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:54,420
Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life.

37
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:57,515
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.

38
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:00,133
(Laughter)

39
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,023
(Applause)

40
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,300
I mean, many of you probably have said,

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,888
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,863
(Laughter)

43
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:14,260
We used to marry,

44
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,169
and had sex for the first time.

45
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,076
But now we marry,

46
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,003
and we stop having sex with others.

47
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:25,677
The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love.

48
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,895
Men relied on women's fidelity

49
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,959
in order to know whose children these are,

50
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,300
and who gets the cows when I die.

51
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:38,655
Now, everyone wants to know

52
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,403
what percentage of people cheat.

53
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,634
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.

54
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,236
(Laughter)

55
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,640
It applies to you.

56
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:52,959
But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding:

57
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,021
sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps.

58
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:02,817
So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition

59
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,956
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

60
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:11,586
estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent.

61
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:15,959
But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions.

62
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,792
So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong

63
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,969
for our partner to lie
about having an affair,

64
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:25,190
but just about the same
amount of us will say

65
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:28,348
that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one.

66
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,808
(Laughter)

67
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,577
Now, I like this definition
of an affair --

68
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:39,326
it brings together the three key elements:

69
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:45,032
a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair;

70
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:49,826
an emotional connection
to one degree or another;

71
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,466
and a sexual alchemy.

72
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,337
And alchemy is the key word here,

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:05:02,265
because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving,

74
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:05,349
can be as powerful and as enchanting

75
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,839
as hours of actual lovemaking.

76
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,315
As Marcel Proust said,

77
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,640
it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person.

78
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:21,758
So it's never been easier to cheat,

79
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:25,235
and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret.

80
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:30,459
And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll.

81
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:35,342
When marriage was an economic enterprise,

82
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:38,308
infidelity threatened
our economic security.

83
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,959
But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement,

84
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,779
infidelity threatens
our emotional security.

85
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,040
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --

86
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,269
that was the space where
we sought pure love.

87
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,482
But now that we seek love in marriage,

88
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,142
adultery destroys it.

89
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:03,347
Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,613
We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person

91
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,810
to fulfill an endless list of needs:

92
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,410
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,

93
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,563
the best parent, my trusted confidant,

94
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:24,657
my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal.

95
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,929
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,

96
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,245
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,

97
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm the one.

98
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:38,514
And infidelity tells me I'm not.

99
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,197
It is the ultimate betrayal.

100
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,125
Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love.

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,561
But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful,

102
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,919
today it is often traumatic,

103
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
because it threatens our sense of self.

104
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,823
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.

105
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,595
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.

106
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:06,801
I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was.

107
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,022
Now, I question everything."

108
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:14,819
Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity.

109
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,124
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

110
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:19,450
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

111
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,905
And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me,

112
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:26,532
when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick.

113
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:27,982
Married, two kids.

114
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,659
Nick just left on a business trip,

115
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,190
and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys,

116
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,127
when she sees a message
appear on the screen:

117
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,665
"Can't wait to see you."

118
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,054
Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other.

119
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,379
And then another message:

120
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:47,140
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."

121
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,243
And Heather realizes

122
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:51,611
these are not for her.

123
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,808
She also tells me
that her father had affairs,

124
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:59,753
but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket,

125
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:01,935
and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar.

126
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,610
Heather, she goes digging,

127
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,673
and she finds hundreds of messages,

128
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:13,086
and photos exchanged
and desires expressed.

129
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,118
The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair

130
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:19,300
unfold in front of her in real time,

131
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,272
And it made me think:

132
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:26,318
Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts.

133
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,113
But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days.

134
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,417
Because of this romantic ideal,

135
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:38,475
we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor.

136
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:42,544
But we also have never
been more inclined to stray,

137
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,255
and not because we have new desires today,

138
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,001
but because we live in an era

139
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:50,682
where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires,

140
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:54,138
because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy.

141
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,031
And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy,

142
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:01,864
today we divorce
because we could be happier.

143
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,847
And if divorce carried all the shame,

144
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,738
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

145
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,102
is the new shame.

146
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:15,168
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends

147
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,429
because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick,

148
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,977
and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice:

149
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,602
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

150
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:30,737
And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation.

151
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,364
Staying is the new shame.

152
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:38,359
So if we can divorce,

153
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,455
why do we still have affairs?

154
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,563
Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats,

155
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:50,408
either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you.

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,686
But millions of people
can't all be pathological.

157
00:09:56,383 --> 00:10:00,291
The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home,

158
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,715
then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere,

159
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:07,182
assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage

160
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:10,038
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

161
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:14,499
But what if passion
has a finite shelf life?

162
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:19,338
What if there are things
that even a good relationship

163
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:20,743
can never provide?

164
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:25,202
If even happy people cheat,

165
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:26,798
what is it about?

166
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:31,641
The vast majority of people
that I actually work with

167
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,425
are not at all chronic philanderers.

168
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:38,475
They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs,

169
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,048
and at least for their partner.

170
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:43,501
But they find themselves in a conflict

171
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,540
between their values and their behavior.

172
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,935
They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades,

173
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,574
but one day they cross a line

174
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:57,047
that they never thought they would cross,

175
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:59,794
and at the risk of losing everything.

176
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,635
But for a glimmer of what?

177
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:06,609
Affairs are an act of betrayal,

178
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,705
and they are also an expression
of longing and loss.

179
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,528
At the heart of an affair,
you will often find

180
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:18,789
a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection,

181
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:24,559
for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity,

182
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,226
a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves

183
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:33,540
or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.

184
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,766
I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya,

185
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:40,382
who is blissfully married,

186
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:41,847
loves her husband,

187
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,230
and would never want to hurt the man.

188
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,831
But she also tells me

189
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,005
that she's always done
what was expected of her:

190
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:53,685
good girl, good wife, good mother,

191
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:56,677
taking care of her immigrant parents.

192
00:11:56,677 --> 00:12:01,189
Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard

193
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:02,675
after Hurricane Sandy.

194
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:08,087
And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her.

195
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:14,769
But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had.

196
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:21,030
And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another,

197
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,748
it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from,

198
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:28,585
but the person that
we have ourselves become.

199
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:33,274
And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person,

200
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,816
as much as we are
looking for another self.

201
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,602
Now, all over the world,

202
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:44,458
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.

203
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,911
They feel alive.

204
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:52,286
And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses --

205
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:54,141
of a parent who died,

206
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,341
and a friend that went too soon,

207
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,141
and bad news at the doctor.

208
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:04,138
Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair,

209
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:06,608
because they raise these questions.

210
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,536
Is this it? Is there more?

211
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:12,957
Am I going on for another
25 years like this?

212
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,362
Will I ever feel that thing again?

213
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:22,788
And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions

214
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:25,947
are the ones that propel
people to cross the line,

215
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:29,939
and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness,

216
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,735
in an antidote to death.

217
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,867
And contrary to what you may think,

218
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:41,903
affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire:

219
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:45,392
desire for attention,
desire to feel special,

220
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,308
desire to feel important.

221
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:51,247
And the very structure of an affair,

222
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,499
the fact that you can
never have your lover,

223
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:54,938
keeps you wanting.

224
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:57,959
That in itself is a desire machine,

225
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,747
because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

226
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:03,522
keeps you wanting
that which you can't have.

227
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,177
Now some of you probably think

228
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:10,807
that affairs don't happen
in open relationships,

229
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:11,998
but they do.

230
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,562
First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same

231
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,743
as the conversation about infidelity.

232
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:21,959
But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have

233
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,632
the freedom to have other sexual partners,

234
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:28,720
we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden,

235
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,207
that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do,

236
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:35,006
then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to.

237
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:40,935
And I've also told
quite a few of my patients

238
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:45,536
that if they could bring
into their relationships

239
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:49,167
one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve

240
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,879
that they put into their affairs,

241
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,124
they probably would never need to see me.

242
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,148
(Laughter)

243
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,647
So how do we heal from an affair?

244
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:02,347
Desire runs deep.

245
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:04,242
Betrayal runs deep.

246
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,821
But it can be healed.

247
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,920
And some affairs are death knells

248
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,682
for relationships that were
already dying on the vine.

249
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:17,769
But others will jolt us
into new possibilities.

250
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:19,936
The fact is, the majority of couples

251
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,150
who have experienced
affairs stay together.

252
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,399
But some of them will merely survive,

253
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,103
and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

254
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:34,460
They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience.

255
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:38,198
And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner,

256
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,558
who will often say,

257
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,365
"You think I didn't want more?

258
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,207
But I'm not the one who did it."

259
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,110
But now that the affair is exposed,

260
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,244
they, too, get to claim more,

261
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,886
and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo

262
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:53,800
that may not have been working
for them that well, either.

263
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,110
I've noticed that a lot of couples,

264
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,251
in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

265
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,587
because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order,

266
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:09,169
will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness

267
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,824
that they haven't had in decades.

268
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,680
And, partners who were
sexually indifferent

269
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,279
find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious,

270
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,814
they don't know where it's coming from.

271
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:24,521
Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire,

272
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,840
and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth.

273
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:33,004
So when an affair is exposed,

274
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:36,165
what are some of the specific things
that couples can do?

275
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:42,204
We know from trauma that healing begins

276
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:46,196
when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing.

277
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,050
So for the partner who had the affair,

278
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,582
for Nick,

279
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,387
one thing is to end the affair,

280
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:59,109
but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing

281
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:02,315
guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.

282
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,264
But the truth is

283
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:07,365
that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs

284
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,463
may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner,

285
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,676
but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself.

286
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,976
And that distinction is important.

287
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,856
And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship.

288
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:24,326
He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries.

289
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:26,949
It's his responsibility to bring it up,

290
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,929
because if he thinks about it,

291
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,939
he can relieve Heather from the obsession,

292
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:35,149
and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten,

293
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,332
and that in itself
begins to restore trust.

294
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,429
But for Heather,

295
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,174
or deceived partners,

296
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:48,512
it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth,

297
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:52,245
to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities

298
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:55,652
that give back joy
and meaning and identity.

299
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,869
But even more important,

300
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:02,772
is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details --

301
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:04,969
Where were you? Where did you do it?

302
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,991
How often? Is she better
than me in bed? --

303
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,475
questions that only inflict more pain,

304
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,959
and keep you awake at night.

305
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:17,350
And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions,

306
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,650
the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives --

307
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:23,127
What did this affair mean for you?

308
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,899
What were you able to express
or experience there

309
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,154
that you could no longer do with me?

310
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:31,186
What was it like for you
when you came home?

311
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:34,585
What is it about us that you value?

312
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:36,737
Are you pleased this is over?

313
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:42,725
Every affair will redefine a relationship,

314
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:45,607
and every couple will determine

315
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,142
what the legacy of the affair will be.

316
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,411
But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away.

317
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,959
And the dilemmas of love and desire,

318
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:02,929
they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad,

319
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:04,903
and victim and perpetrator.

320
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:10,296
Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms.

321
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,650
There are many ways
that we betray our partner:

322
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,819
with contempt, with neglect,

323
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,292
with indifference, with violence.

324
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,437
Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner.

325
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:24,041
In other words, the victim of an affair

326
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,983
is not always the victim of the marriage.

327
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,048
Now, you've listened to me,

328
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,423
and I know what you're thinking:

329
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,197
She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair.

330
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:41,999
(Laughter)

331
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,265
So, you're wrong.

332
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,174
I am not French.

333
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,119
(Laughter)

334
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,023
(Applause)

335
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,269
And I'm not pro-affair.

336
00:19:56,674 --> 00:20:01,058
But because I think that good
can come out of an affair,

337
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,389
I have often been asked
this very strange question:

338
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,150
Would I ever recommend it?

339
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:10,505
Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair

340
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:13,049
than I would recommend you have cancer,

341
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,752
and yet we know that people
who have been ill

342
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:19,950
often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective.

343
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,906
The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference

344
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,417
when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against?

345
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,749
I said, "Yes."

346
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,583
(Laughter)

347
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:37,505
I look at affairs from a dual perspective:

348
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:41,153
hurt and betrayal on one side,

349
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:44,509
growth and self-discovery on the other --

350
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,605
what it did to you,
and what it meant for me.

351
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:53,289
And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair

352
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,092
that has been revealed,

353
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:57,420
I will often tell them this:

354
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,825
Today in the West,

355
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,704
most of us are going to have
two or three relationships

356
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,403
or marriages,

357
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:09,538
and some of us are going
to do it with the same person.

358
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,911
Your first marriage is over.

359
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:16,474
Would you like to create
a second one together?

360
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,595
Thank you.

361
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:25,253
