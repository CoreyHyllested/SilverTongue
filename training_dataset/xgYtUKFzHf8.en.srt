00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,269
Hello.

1
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:18,713
This is my first trip,

2
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:22,975
first time in life I'm outside
of the walls of Gaza.

3
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,111
I'm so happy to be here.

4
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:31,059
(Applause)

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:36,587
My ambition always was
to be a pilot, to fly a plane,

6
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:41,193
to feel free to fly the sky,
to touch the sky.

7
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:44,192
But that didn't happen.

8
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:47,832
Simply, I live in Gaza,
there is no airport.

9
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,244
All borders are closed on every side.

10
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:56,426
We live in one of the biggest
prisons in the world.

11
00:00:57,097 --> 00:01:01,648
The only thing I can do
is just to look up to the sky.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,735
On some days, we are lucky
if we have electricity

13
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:08,497
for four or five hours.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,164
When it's cold, we make a fire
on the front or on the roof of our homes.

15
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:17,322
Sometimes we make food, too.

16
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:23,296
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything
for journalists who come to my homeland

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,548
to tell the stories
about what's going on in Gaza.

18
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,208
Many mornings,
I had to go to the border area

19
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,880
to collect a journalist.

20
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:36,165
If anything should happen
to the journalist,

21
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,610
or if the journalist decides
to cover a story

22
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:43,332
the government doesn't want us to cover,

23
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,093
bad things could happen.

24
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,986
Navigating through my country
helping journalists,

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,622
filmmakers, news crews,
is my working life.

26
00:01:55,607 --> 00:02:00,045
I believe my success comes
from building a relationship

27
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,340
not only with journalists
and the news crews,

28
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:06,481
but also with the communities
in the Gaza Strip.

29
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:11,135
These communities who don't want
their stories to be told,

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,718
I never looked to them
as stories or numbers.

31
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:18,951
But like me, they are human beings.

32
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:26,108
I have built up
many relationships over 10 years.

33
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:27,783
And guess what?

34
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:31,601
This gives me the chance
to get access to people,

35
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,894
to stories that others can't.

36
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:39,587
In some certain situations,
I feel, as a woman, I have more power.

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,049
Many male journalists in my society,

38
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:48,350
they want to cover a story
about drug addiction in my country.

39
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:53,390
That problem started
when the Gaza tunnel was being built.

40
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,593
With the siege on Gaza,

41
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,252
tunnels brought people all the basic needs

42
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:02,764
like food, building material,
other stuff we needed.

43
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:07,574
But not anymore, because the Egyptian side
flooded them up with water

44
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,795
and they are not working anymore.

45
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,501
Drugs were being smuggled,

46
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,795
and many young people got addicted, too.

47
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:20,063
In the tradition
of the Palestinian society,

48
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,699
it's forbidden for men
to enter the household.

49
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:27,394
So, no male journalists get the story.

50
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,632
But I did.

51
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:33,844
I have a wonderful husband,

52
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,670
a wonderful husband who supports me

53
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:40,479
despite all the criticism
he gets from the society.

54
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,552
He's at home now with my two kids,

55
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:46,266
and I have another one
that's growing in here.

56
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:52,044
(Applause)

57
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:55,939
When I'm working,
I call him every two hours,

58
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:59,753
and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,

59
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:01,204
he should call my contact,

60
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:04,390
the one who gives me access to the story,

61
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,004
which is the one who I trust.

62
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:11,130
One of the times in Gaza,

63
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:16,093
during the kidnapping
of the British journalist Alan Johnston,

64
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:20,016
I was asked by an American magazine

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,942
to set up a meeting
with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.

66
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:29,323
The journalist covering the story and I

67
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:32,376
were asked to meet outside of his hotel.

68
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:38,738
They came, they picked us up
in a black van with black windows,

69
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,463
they were wearing masks on that day.

70
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:48,947
And they drove us away,
far away in the middle of a field.

71
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:51,431
They took our cell phones

72
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:56,375
and we did the interview
with the kidnapper outside in that field.

73
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,359
I was so scared that day,

74
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,906
a day I will never forget.

75
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:06,514
So, why do I do what I do?

76
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:10,363
I do it because I believe if I didn't,

77
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:14,942
a huge part of the story
about Gaza will be missing.

78
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:20,126
There are some more stories
I could tell you about my country.

79
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,426
And not all of them are bad.

80
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:27,564
I love my country, despite
the terrible situation we live in --

81
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,507
siege, poverty, unemployment --

82
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,900
but there is life.

83
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:39,210
There are people who are dreamers
and amazing people full of energy.

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,105
We have wonderful music,
and a great music school.

85
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,309
We have parkour dancers
who dance in the rubble of their homes.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,898
And Gaza is the only place
in the Arab world

87
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:57,317
where Muslims and Christians
live in strong brotherhood.

88
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:03,660
(Applause)

89
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:05,232
During the time of war,

90
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:09,328
the hardest part for me
is leaving the house early in the morning,

91
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,022
leaving my children.

92
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:15,379
I take a picture of them everyday

93
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,680
because I never know
if I will make it back to them.

94
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:25,817
Being a fixer and a journalist
is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.

95
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:30,211
But when I hear the sound of the shelling
or the sound of the bombing,

96
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:33,173
I just head straight toward it,

97
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:37,173
because I want to be there first,

98
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:41,094
because these stories should be told.

99
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,352
When my children were small
and we heard the sound of the war,

100
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:52,214
I used to tell them
that they were fireworks.

101
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:55,336
Now they are older, they understand.

102
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:59,660
I do have terrible nightmares

103
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:03,898
because of all that I witnessed
during war times,

104
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:08,177
especially these lifeless bodies
of young children.

105
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:12,479
I still remember a little girl,
her name is Hala.

106
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:15,233
She's the only survivor from her family.

107
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:18,878
Her picture will be with me forever.

108
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:21,270
I will never forget her.

109
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:29,485
I'm proud that I can stand here
and be here today with you.

110
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:36,659
I'm proud that I can tell you
stories, sad and happy,

111
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:41,161
stories about my small corner
of the world, Gaza.

112
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:46,174
I'm proud that I am
the first female fixer working in Gaza.

113
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,828
And the funny thing is
they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.

114
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,653
(Laughter)

115
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:57,626
I hope one day, I will get the chance
to tell the stories of all other women,

116
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,163
all other amazing women
I know in my country.

117
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:05,204
I hope that one day
I can help other women in my country

118
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,416
to be fixers like me.

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,748
And of course sometimes,
I feel I can't do this work anymore,

120
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,017
it's just too much for me.

121
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,579
But I remember these words:

122
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:20,149
"Don't limit your challenge,
but challenge your limit.

123
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:24,243
Don't allow others to stand
in front of your dreams."

124
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:26,663
Thank you.

125
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:33,687
(Applause)
