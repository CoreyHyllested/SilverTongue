0
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,666
As a boy in Lima,

1
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,801
my grandfather told me a legend

2
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,079
of the Spanish conquest of Peru.

3
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:23,546
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
had been captured and killed.

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,553
Pizarro and his conquistadors
had grown rich,

5
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:29,763
and tales of their conquest
and glory had reached Spain

6
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:35,162
and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
hungry for gold and glory.

7
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:38,953
They would go into towns and ask the Inca,

8
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:42,752
"Where's another civilization
we can conquer? Where's more gold?"

9
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,155
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,

10
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,257
"Go to the Amazon.

11
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,413
You'll find all the gold you want there.

12
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:56,151
In fact, there is a city called Paititi --
El Dorado in Spanish --

13
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,802
made entirely of gold."

14
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,199
The Spanish set off into the jungle,

15
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:04,785
but the few that return
come back with stories,

16
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:09,711
stories of powerful shamans,

17
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,639
of warriors with poisoned arrows,

18
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:16,441
of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,

19
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:21,217
spiders that ate birds,
snakes that swallowed men whole

20
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,525
and a river that boiled.

21
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,779
All this became a childhood memory.

22
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:28,962
And years passed.

23
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,461
I'm working on my PhD at SMU,

24
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:35,389
trying to understand
Peru's geothermal energy potential,

25
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,459
when I remember this legend,

26
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,332
and I began asking that question.

27
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:42,863
Could the boiling river exist?

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,339
I asked colleagues from universities,

29
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:47,520
the government,

30
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,037
oil, gas and mining companies,

31
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,967
and the answer was a unanimous no.

32
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,459
And this makes sense.

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,698
You see, boiling rivers
do exist in the world,

34
00:01:57,722 --> 00:02:00,181
but they're generally
associated with volcanoes.

35
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,796
You need a powerful heat source

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,186
to produce such a large
geothermal manifestation.

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,414
And as you can see from the red dots
here, which are volcanoes,

38
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,256
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,098
nor in most of Peru.

40
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:20,390
So it follows: We should not expect
to see a boiling river.

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,748
Telling this same story
at a family dinner,

42
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,242
my aunt tells me,

43
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:32,248
"But no, Andrés, I've been there.
I've swum in that river."

44
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:36,535
(Laughter)

45
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,306
Then my uncle jumps in.

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,060
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.

47
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:45,067
You see, you can only swim in it
after a very heavy rain,

48
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,337
and it's protected by a powerful shaman.

49
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,678
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."

50
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,062
(Laughter)

51
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,237
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]

52
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,475
You know, despite all
my scientific skepticism,

53
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,931
I found myself hiking into the jungle,
guided by my aunt,

54
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:04,852
over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center,

55
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:08,494
and well, honestly,
mentally preparing myself

56
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:12,894
to behold the legendary
"warm stream of the Amazon."

57
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:16,292
But then ...

58
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,638
I heard something,

59
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:20,704
a low surge

60
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:25,042
that got louder and louder

61
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,260
as we came closer.

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,228
It sounded like ocean waves
constantly crashing,

63
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:36,937
and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,
coming up through the trees.

64
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:40,260
And then, I saw this.

65
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,260
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,

66
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:47,561
and the average temperatures in the river

67
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,572
were 86 degrees C.

68
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,807
This is not quite
the 100-degree C boiling

69
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:57,708
but definitely close enough.

70
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:01,388
The river flowed hot and fast.

71
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:05,829
I followed it upriver and was led by,
actually, the shaman's apprentice

72
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,637
to the most sacred site on the river.

73
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,067
And this is what's bizarre --

74
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:11,073
It starts off as a cold stream.

75
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,739
And here, at this site,

76
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,930
is the home of the Yacumama,

77
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:19,297
mother of the waters,
a giant serpent spirit

78
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,394
who births hot and cold water.

79
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:26,427
And here we find a hot spring,

80
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:31,809
mixing with cold stream water
underneath her protective motherly jaws

81
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,078
and thus bringing their legends to life.

82
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,261
The next morning, I woke up and --

83
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,504
(Laughter)

84
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:42,559
I asked for tea.

85
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,823
I was handed a mug, a tea bag

86
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,175
and, well, pointed towards the river.

87
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:52,584
To my surprise, the water was clean
and had a pleasant taste,

88
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,602
which is a little weird
for geothermal systems.

89
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,989
What was amazing

90
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,997
is that the locals had always
known about this place,

91
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:04,725
and that I was by no means
the first outsider to see it.

92
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:08,638
It was just part of their everyday life.

93
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,809
They drink its water.

94
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,388
They take in its vapor.

95
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:16,103
They cook with it,

96
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,637
clean with it,

97
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,459
even make their medicines with it.

98
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,840
I met the shaman,

99
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,053
and he seemed like an extension
of the river and his jungle.

100
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,672
He asked for my intentions

101
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,188
and listened carefully.

102
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:36,373
Then, to my tremendous relief --

103
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:39,944
I was freaking out,
to be honest with you --

104
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:44,247
a smile began to snake across his face,
and he just laughed.

105
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,568
(Laughter)

106
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:52,391
I had received the shaman's blessing
to study the river,

107
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,819
on the condition that after I take
the water samples

108
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,359
and analyze them in my lab,

109
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,193
wherever I was in the world,

110
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:04,031
that I pour the waters
back into the ground

111
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:06,102
so that, as the shaman said,

112
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,871
the waters could find their way back home.

113
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:14,859
I've been back every year
since that first visit in 2011,

114
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:18,308
and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,

115
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:22,129
demanding and at times dangerous.

116
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:26,128
One story was even featured
in National Geographic Magazine.

117
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,239
I was trapped on a small rock
about the size of a sheet of paper

118
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,303
in sandals and board shorts,

119
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,733
in between an 80 degree C river

120
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:38,486
and a hot spring that, well,
looked like this, close to boiling.

121
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,608
And on top of that,
it was Amazon rain forest.

122
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,712
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.

123
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:49,298
The temperature differential
made it all white. It was a whiteout.

124
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:52,361
Intense.

125
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:56,596
Now, after years of work,

126
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,262
I'll soon be submitting my geophysical
and geochemical studies for publication.

127
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,022
And I'd like to share, today,
with all of you here, on the TED stage,

128
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:10,236
for the first time,
some of these discoveries.

129
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,871
Well, first off, it's not a legend.

130
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,642
Surprise!

131
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,991
(Laughter)

132
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,529
When I first started the research,

133
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,532
the satellite imagery was too
low-resolution to be meaningful.

134
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,184
There were just no good maps.

135
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:28,145
Thanks to the support
of the Google Earth team,

136
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,514
I now have this.

137
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:36,601
Not only that, the indigenous name
of the river, Shanay-timpishka,

138
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,268
"boiled with the heat of the sun,"

139
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,919
indicating that I'm not the first
to wonder why the river boils,

140
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,170
and showing that humanity
has always sought to explain

141
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,733
the world around us.

142
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,924
So why does the river boil?

143
00:07:55,948 --> 00:08:00,361
(Bubbling sounds)

144
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,880
It actually took me three years
to get that footage.

145
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,484
Fault-fed hot springs.

146
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,258
As we have hot blood running
through our veins and arteries,

147
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:16,330
so, too, the earth has hot water
running through its cracks and faults.

148
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:20,757
Where these arteries come to the surface,
these earth arteries,

149
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:23,155
we'll get geothermal manifestations:

150
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:27,199
fumaroles, hot springs
and in our case, the boiling river.

151
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:32,559
What's truly incredible, though,
is the scale of this place.

152
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,567
Next time you cross the road,
think about this.

153
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:39,199
The river flows wider than a two-lane road

154
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:41,087
along most of its path.

155
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:47,017
It flows hot for 6,24 kilometers.

156
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,732
Truly impressive.

157
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:54,077
There are thermal pools
larger than this TED stage,

158
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,577
and that waterfall that you see there

159
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,639
is six meters tall --

160
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:02,676
and all with near-boiling water.

161
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,299
We mapped the temperatures
along the river,

162
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:09,441
and this was by far the most
demanding part of the fieldwork.

163
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:13,553
And the results were just awesome.

164
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,730
Sorry -- the geoscientist
in me coming out.

165
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,180
And it showed this amazing trend.

166
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,420
You see, the river starts off cold.

167
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,439
It then heats up, cools back down,
heats up, cools back down,

168
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,081
heats up again, and then has
this beautiful decay curve

169
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,477
until it smashes into this cold river.

170
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,333
Now, I understand not all of you
are geothermal scientists,

171
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,582
so to put it in more everyday terms:

172
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,358
Everyone loves coffee.

173
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,651
Yes? Good.

174
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:44,200
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,

175
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,334
an extra-hot one, well, 60.

176
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,067
So, put in coffee shop terms,

177
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:51,654
the boiling river plots like this.

178
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,900
There you have your hot coffee.

179
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,630
Here you have your extra-hot coffee,

180
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:58,828
and you can see
that there's a bit point there

181
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:01,840
where the river is still hotter
than even the extra-hot coffee.

182
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:03,856
And these are average water temperatures.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,079
We took these in the dry season to ensure
the purest geothermal temperatures.

184
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:11,223
But there's a magic number here
that's not being shown,

185
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,777
and that number is 47 degrees C,

186
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,378
because that's where things start to hurt,

187
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:21,575
and I know this from very
personal experience.

188
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:25,012
Above that temperature,
you don't want to get in that water.

189
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:26,698
You need to be careful.

190
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:28,037
It can be deadly.

191
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,995
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,

192
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,198
and what's shocking to me,
is the process is pretty much the same.

193
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,579
So they fall in and the first thing
to go are the eyes.

194
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,970
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.
They turn this milky-white color.

195
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:43,344
The stream is carrying them.

196
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:46,431
They're trying to swim out,
but their meat is cooking on the bone

197
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,621
because it's so hot.

198
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,490
So they're losing power, losing power,

199
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:52,904
until finally they get to a point
where hot water goes into their mouths

200
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,149
and they cook from the inside out.

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,672
(Laughter)

202
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,815
A bit sadistic, aren't we?

203
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,179
Jeez.

204
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,980
Leave them marinating for a little longer.

205
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,196
What's, again, amazing
are these temperatures.

206
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,698
They're similar to things that I've seen
on volcanoes all over the world

207
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,259
and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.

208
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,204
But here's the thing:

209
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:27,172
the data is showing
that the boiling river exists

210
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:29,486
independent of volcanism.

211
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,911
It's neither magmatic
or volcanic in origin,

212
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:41,925
and again, over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center.

213
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:46,909
How can a boiling river exist like this?

214
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,946
I've asked geothermal experts
and volcanologists for years,

215
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,787
and I'm still unable to find another
non-volcanic geothermal system

216
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,378
of this magnitude.

217
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,645
It's unique.

218
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:04,931
It's special on a global scale.

219
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,176
So, still -- how does it work?

220
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,596
Where do we get this heat?

221
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,279
There's still more research to be done

222
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:18,492
to better constrain the problem
and better understand the system,

223
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,842
but from what the data is telling us now,

224
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,230
it looks to be the result
of a large hydrothermal system.

225
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,611
Basically, it works like this:

226
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:29,943
So, the deeper you go
into the earth, the hotter it gets.

227
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,595
We refer to this
as the geothermal gradient.

228
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,388
The waters could be coming
from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,

229
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,411
then seeping down deep into the earth

230
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,202
and coming out to form the boiling river

231
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:46,233
after getting heated up
from the geothermal gradient,

232
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,550
all due to this unique geologic setting.

233
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,434
Now, we found
that in and around the river --

234
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,951
this is working with colleagues

235
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,062
from National Geographic,
Dr. Spencer Wells,

236
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,796
and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --

237
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,082
we genetically sequenced
the extremophile lifeforms

238
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:07,710
living in and around the river,
and have found new lifeforms,

239
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:11,149
unique species living
in the boiling river.

240
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:17,507
But again, despite all of these studies,
all of these discoveries and the legends,

241
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,499
a question remains:

242
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:24,624
What is the significance
of the boiling river?

243
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:31,247
What is the significance
of this stationary cloud

244
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,147
that always hovers
over this patch of jungle?

245
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,983
And what is the significance

246
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,990
of a detail in a childhood legend?

247
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,655
To the shaman and his community,
it's a sacred site.

248
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:49,759
To me, as a geoscientist,

249
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,626
it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.

250
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,772
But to the illegal loggers
and cattle farmers,

251
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,439
it's just another resource to exploit.

252
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,607
And to the Peruvian government,
it's just another stretch

253
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:12,575
of unprotected land ready for development.

254
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,782
My goal is to ensure
that whoever controls this land

255
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:21,924
understands the boiling river's
uniqueness and significance.

256
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:24,630
Because that's the question,

257
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,487
one of significance.

258
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,897
And the thing there is,

259
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,191
we define significance.

260
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,658
It's us. We have that power.

261
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:40,410
We are the ones who draw that line

262
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:42,782
between the sacred and the trivial.

263
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,012
And in this age,

264
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:49,534
where everything seems mapped,
measured and studied,

265
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,756
in this age of information,

266
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,471
I remind you all that discoveries
are not just made

267
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:03,058
in the black void of the unknown

268
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,562
but in the white noise
of overwhelming data.

269
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,847
There remains so much to explore.

270
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,453
We live in an incredible world.

271
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,996
So go out.

272
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:22,163
Be curious.

273
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:26,754
Because we do live in a world

274
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,819
where shamans still sing
to the spirits of the jungle,

275
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,240
where rivers do boil

276
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,835
and where legends do come to life.

277
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,199
Thank you very much.

278
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:48,809
(Applause)
