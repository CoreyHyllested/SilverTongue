00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,576
So how many of you have ever
been in a cave before?

1
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:16,987
Okay, a few of you.

2
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:18,619
When you think of a cave, most of you think

3
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,780
of a tunnel going through solid rock,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,711
and in fact, that's how most caves are.

5
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,094
Around this half of the country,

6
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,100
most of your caves are made of limestone.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,048
Back where I'm from, most of our
caves are made of lava rock,

8
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,881
because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.

9
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,931
But the caves I want to share
with you today are made

10
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:36,044
completely of ice, specifically glacier ice

11
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,042
that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain

12
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:41,125
in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,188
Now Mount Hood's only
one hour's drive from Portland,

14
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:45,911
the largest city in Oregon,

15
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,140
where over two million people live.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,387
Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer

17
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,944
is to find a new cave

18
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,157
and be the first human to ever go into it.

19
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,124
The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer

20
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:58,555
is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.

21
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,763
Now these days, with so many people hiking around,

22
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:02,688
it's pretty hard to find a new cave,

23
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,218
so you can imagine how excited we were

24
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:05,989
to find three new caves

25
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:08,025
within sight of Oregon's largest city

26
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,071
and realize that they had never been explored

27
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,402
or mapped before.

28
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:12,598
It was kind of like being an astronaut,

29
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,285
because we were getting to
see things and go places

30
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,569
that no one had ever seen or gone to before.

31
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,303
So what is a glacier?

32
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,216
Well, those of you who have
ever seen or touched snow,

33
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,499
you know that it's really light,

34
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:27,220
because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals
clumped together, and it's mostly air.

35
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,630
If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,

36
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,828
it gets really small, hard and dense.

37
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:33,580
Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows

38
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,361
over 20 feet a year,

39
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,304
it crushes the air out of it

40
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,485
and gradually forms it into hard blue ice.

41
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:43,445
Now each year, more and more ice
stacks up on top of it,

42
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,357
and eventually it gets so heavy

43
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:47,143
that it starts to slide down the mountain

44
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:48,581
under its own weight,

45
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,879
forming a slow-moving river of ice.

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,224
When ice packed like that starts to move,

47
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:55,334
we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.

48
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,154
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in

49
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:58,830
is the Sandy Glacier.

50
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,283
Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,

51
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:03,950
it melts in the summer sun,

52
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,809
and it forms little rivers of water
on the flow along the ice,

53
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09,686
and they start to melt and bore
their way down through the glacier,

54
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:11,614
forming big networks of caves,

55
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,919
sometimes going all the way down
to the underlying bedrock.

56
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,991
Now the crazy thing about glacier caves

57
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:20,098
is that each year, new tunnels form.

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,091
Different waterfalls pop up or move around

59
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,223
from place to place inside the cave.

60
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:26,068
Warm water from the top of the ice

61
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:27,545
is boring its way down,

62
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,485
and warm air from below the mountain

63
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,926
actually rises up, gets into the cave,

64
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,469
and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.

65
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,596
But the weirdest thing about glacier caves

66
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,702
is that the entire cave is moving,

67
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,582
because it's formed inside a block of ice

68
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,273
the size of a small city

69
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,670
that's slowly sliding down the mountain.

70
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,497
Now this is Brent McGregor,

71
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:48,469
my cave exploration partner.

72
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,084
He and I have both been exploring caves a long time

73
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,052
and we've been climbing mountains a long time,

74
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:56,132
but neither one of us had ever really
explored a glacier cave before.

75
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:59,177
Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video

76
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:02,804
of a couple of hikers that stumbled across
the entrance to one of these caves.

77
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,824
There were no GPS coordinates for it,

78
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,367
and all we knew was that it was somewhere

79
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,047
out on the Sandy Glacier.

80
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,646
So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,

81
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,624
and we found a big crack in the ice.

82
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,825
We had to build snow and ice anchors

83
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:18,017
so that we could tie off ropes
and rappel down into the hole.

84
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:20,753
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.

85
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:23,304
At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel

86
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,795
going right up the mountain

87
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,328
underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.

88
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,732
We followed this cave back for about a half mile

89
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,371
until it came to an end,

90
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:33,497
and then with the help of our survey tools

91
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:35,565
we made a three-dimensional map of the cave

92
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,088
on our way back out.

93
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,146
So how do you map a cave?

94
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:41,874
Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps

95
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:45,098
because they have pits and holes
going to overlapping levels.

96
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,702
To make a cave map, you have to set up

97
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:49,597
survey stations every few feet inside the cave,

98
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,888
and you use a laser to measure
the distance between those stations.

99
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:55,327
Then you use a compass and an inclinometer

100
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,263
to measure the direction the cave is headed

101
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:59,979
and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.

102
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,709
Now those of you taking trigonometry,

103
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,820
that particular type of math is very useful

104
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,353
for making maps like this

105
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,598
because it allows you to measure
heights and distances

106
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,503
without actually having to go there.

107
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,882
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,

108
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,913
the more useful I found all that math

109
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:16,155
that I originally hated in school to be.

110
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,028
So when you're done surveying,

111
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,455
you take all this data and
you punch it into a computer

112
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:23,075
and you find someone that can draw really well,

113
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,723
and you have them draft up a map

114
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,276
that looks something like this,

115
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:29,544
and it'll show you both a
bird's-eye view of the passage

116
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:31,994
as well as a profile view of the passage,

117
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:33,714
kind of like an ant farm view.

118
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:35,713
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave

119
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:38,761
because it was like a big dragon
sleeping under the snow.

120
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,273
Now later this summer, as more
snow melted off the glacier,

121
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:44,940
we found more caves, and we realized
they were all connected.

122
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,099
Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,

123
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,119
Brent discovered this new cave not very far away.

124
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,258
The inside of it was coated with ice,

125
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,185
so we had to wear big spikes
on our feet called crampons

126
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,489
so we could walk around without slipping.

127
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,350
This cave was amazing.

128
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,606
The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green

129
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,344
because the sunlight from far above

130
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,319
was shining through the ice and lighting it all up.

131
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,227
And we couldn't understand why this cave

132
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:09,873
was so much colder than Snow Dragon

133
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:12,782
until we got to the end and we found out why.

134
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,700
There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin

135
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,335
going 130 feet straight up
to the surface of the glacier.

136
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,146
Cold air from the top of the mountain

137
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,960
was flowing down this hole
and blasting through the cave,

138
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,043
freezing everything inside of it.

139
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,254
And we were so excited about finding this new pit,

140
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,562
we actually came back in January the following year

141
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:33,357
so we could be the first ones to explore it.

142
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,782
It was so cold outside,

143
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,040
we actually had to sleep inside the cave.

144
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,768
There's our camp on the left side
of this entrance room.

145
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,377
The next morning, we climbed out of the cave

146
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,386
and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,

147
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,614
where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit

148
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,381
for the very first time.

149
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,468
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination,

150
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,485
I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there

151
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,067
were beyond what we could have ever imagined.

152
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,230
So besides really cool ice,
what else is inside these caves?

153
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,816
Well not too much lives in them
because they're so cold

154
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,826
and the entrance is actually covered up with snow

155
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,535
for about eight months of the year.

156
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:07,471
But there are some really cool things in there.

157
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,834
There's weird bacteria living in the water

158
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,098
that actually eat and digest rocks

159
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,452
to make their own food

160
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:15,168
to live under this ice.

161
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,270
In fact, this past summer, scientists collected

162
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,100
samples of water and ice

163
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,035
specifically to see if things called extremophiles,

164
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:25,874
tiny lifeforms that are evolved
to live in completely hostile conditions,

165
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,310
might be living under the ice,

166
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:30,989
kind of like what they hope to find
on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.

167
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,450
Another really cool things is that,

168
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,706
as seeds and birds land on
the surface of the glacier and die,

169
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,350
they get buried in the snow

170
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,140
and gradually become part of the glacier,

171
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,514
sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.

172
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,757
As these caves form and melt
their way up into the ice,

173
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:47,206
they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling

174
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,935
and fall onto the cave floor,
where we end up finding them.

175
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,961
For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.

176
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,186
It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,

177
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,895
and it's just now starting to sprout.

178
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,590
This mallard duck feather

179
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,911
was found over 1,800 feet
in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.

180
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,869
This duck died on the surface
of the glacier long, long ago,

181
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:09,324
and its feathers have finally made it
down through over 100 feet of ice

182
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,508
before falling inside the cave.

183
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,040
And this beautiful quartz crystal

184
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,165
was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.

185
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,437
Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe

186
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,768
that all these discoveries were
essentially in our own backyard,

187
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,481
hidden away, just waiting to be found.

188
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,754
Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering

189
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,161
in this busy world we live in

190
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,061
kind of seems like something
you can only do with space travel now,

191
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,559
but that's not true.

192
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,837
Every year, new caves get discovered

193
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,602
that no one has ever been in before.

194
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,849
So it's actually not too late for one of you

195
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,710
to become a discoverer yourself.

196
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,571
You just have to be willing to look

197
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,207
and go where people don't often go

198
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,185
and focus your eyes and your mind

199
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:48,402
to recognize the discovery when you see it,

200
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,733
because it might be in your own backyard.

201
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,587
Thank you very much.

202
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:56,711
(Applause)
