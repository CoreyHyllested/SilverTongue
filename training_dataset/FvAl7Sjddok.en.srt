00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'd like to begin this song I wrote

1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
"I find no peace, and all my war is done;

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I fly above the wind,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and yet I cannot arise;

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And naught I have,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and all the world I seize upon."

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
♫ Stand the cold air ♫

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
♫ Glad-handed ♫

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
♫ I gotta just name it ♫

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
♫ My mind won't stop ♫

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
♫ And my heart says go ♫

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
♫ Good things must be here -- yes, right here ♫

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
♫ Here, right here, right here ♫

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
♫ I won't live this life forever ♫

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
♫ I gotta just seize ♫

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
♫ Have but I -- have what I want ♫

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Applause)
