00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:15,136
Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.

1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,325
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,339
CA: It feels like the world is in a place

3
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,200
that we haven't seen for a long time.

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,785
People don't just disagree
in the way that we're familiar with,

5
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,709
on the left-right political divide.

6
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,734
There are much deeper differences afoot.

7
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:33,024
What on earth is going on,
and how did we get here?

8
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:36,051
JH: This is different.

9
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:39,302
There's a much more
apocalyptic sort of feeling.

10
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:41,652
Survey research by Pew Research shows

11
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:45,385
that the degree to which we feel
that the other side is not just --

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,383
we don't just dislike them;
we strongly dislike them,

13
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:51,883
and we think that they are
a threat to the nation.

14
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,871
Those numbers have been going up and up,

15
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:56,632
and those are over 50 percent
now on both sides.

16
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,807
People are scared,

17
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:01,458
because it feels like this is different
than before; it's much more intense.

18
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,002
Whenever I look
at any sort of social puzzle,

19
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:07,143
I always apply the three basic
principles of moral psychology,

20
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,061
and I think they'll help us here.

21
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,818
So the first thing that you
have to always keep in mind

22
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,578
when you're thinking about politics

23
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:14,982
is that we're tribal.

24
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:16,529
We evolved for tribalism.

25
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:19,722
One of the simplest and greatest
insights into human social nature

26
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,919
is the Bedouin proverb:

27
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:22,335
"Me against my brother;

28
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,286
me and my brother against our cousin;

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,812
me and my brother and cousins
against the stranger."

30
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,560
And that tribalism allowed us
to create large societies

31
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,616
and to come together
in order to compete with others.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,321
That brought us out of the jungle
and out of small groups,

33
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:40,368
but it means that we have
eternal conflict.

34
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,133
The question you have to look at is:

35
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:44,821
What aspects of our society
are making that more bitter,

36
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:46,375
and what are calming them down?

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,960
CA: That's a very dark proverb.

38
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:52,157
You're saying that that's actually
baked into most people's mental wiring

39
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,332
at some level?

40
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:57,160
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
a basic aspect of human social cognition.

41
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,507
But we can also live together
really peacefully,

42
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,926
and we've invented all kinds
of fun ways of, like, playing war.

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,332
I mean, sports, politics --

44
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:08,051
these are all ways that we get
to exercise this tribal nature

45
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,658
without actually hurting anyone.

46
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:14,027
We're also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.

47
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,350
So you have to see our tribalism
as something that goes up or down --

48
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:20,226
it's not like we're doomed
to always be fighting each other,

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,100
but we'll never have world peace.

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,202
CA: The size of that tribe
can shrink or expand.

51
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:27,377
JH: Right.

52
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,388
CA: The size of what we consider "us"

53
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:31,833
and what we consider "other" or "them"

54
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:33,987
can change.

55
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,200
And some people believed that process
could continue indefinitely.

56
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,416
JH: That's right.

57
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,646
CA: And we were indeed expanding
the sense of tribe for a while.

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,831
JH: So this is, I think,

59
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,210
where we're getting at what's possibly
the new left-right distinction.

60
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,557
I mean, the left-right
as we've all inherited it,

61
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,420
comes out of the labor
versus capital distinction,

62
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,819
and the working class, and Marx.

63
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,092
But I think what we're seeing
now, increasingly,

64
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,970
is a divide in all the Western democracies

65
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:05,701
between the people
who want to stop at nation,

66
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,475
the people who are more parochial --

67
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,296
and I don't mean that in a bad way --

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,120
people who have much more
of a sense of being rooted,

69
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,337
they care about their town,
their community and their nation.

70
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:19,861
And then those who are
anti-parochial and who --

71
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:23,285
whenever I get confused, I just think
of the John Lennon song "Imagine."

72
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:26,138
"Imagine there's no countries,
nothing to kill or die for."

73
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,375
And so these are the people
who want more global governance,

74
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,073
they don't like nation states,
they don't like borders.

75
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,922
You see this all over Europe as well.

76
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:37,172
There's a great metaphor guy --
actually, his name is Shakespeare --

77
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,777
writing ten years ago in Britain.

78
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,968
He had a metaphor:

79
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:43,265
"Are we drawbridge-uppers
or drawbridge-downers?"

80
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,194
And Britain is divided
52-48 on that point.

81
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,338
And America is divided on that point, too.

82
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,956
CA: And so, those of us
who grew up with The Beatles

83
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,554
and that sort of hippie philosophy
of dreaming of a more connected world --

84
00:03:56,578 --> 00:04:00,419
it felt so idealistic and "how could
anyone think badly about that?"

85
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,747
And what you're saying is that, actually,

86
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:07,073
millions of people today
feel that that isn't just silly;

87
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,958
it's actually dangerous and wrong,
and they're scared of it.

88
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:13,008
JH: I think the big issue, especially
in Europe but also here,

89
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:14,399
is the issue of immigration.

90
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:17,492
And I think this is where
we have to look very carefully

91
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:21,147
at the social science
about diversity and immigration.

92
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,885
Once something becomes politicized,

93
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,933
once it becomes something
that the left loves and the right --

94
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:29,058
then even the social scientists
can't think straight about it.

95
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,039
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.

96
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,270
It clearly creates more innovation.

97
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:35,771
The American economy
has grown enormously from it.

98
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:38,177
Diversity and immigration
do a lot of good things.

99
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,829
But what the globalists,
I think, don't see,

100
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,360
what they don't want to see,

101
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:48,662
is that ethnic diversity
cuts social capital and trust.

102
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,022
There's a very important
study by Robert Putnam,

103
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,902
the author of "Bowling Alone,"

104
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,781
looking at social capital databases.

105
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,752
And basically, the more people
feel that they are the same,

106
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,283
the more they trust each other,

107
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:02,047
the more they can have
a redistributionist welfare state.

108
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,042
Scandinavian countries are so wonderful

109
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:07,415
because they have this legacy
of being small, homogenous countries.

110
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,156
And that leads to
a progressive welfare state,

111
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,983
a set of progressive
left-leaning values, which says,

112
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:17,008
"Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.

113
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:20,064
People in Syria are suffering --
we must welcome them in."

114
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,465
And it's a beautiful thing.

115
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,517
But if, and I was in Sweden
this summer,

116
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,724
if the discourse in Sweden
is fairly politically correct

117
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,985
and they can't talk about the downsides,

118
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,996
you end up bringing a lot of people in.

119
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,712
That's going to cut social capital,

120
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,681
it makes it hard to have a welfare state

121
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,261
and they might end up,
as we have in America,

122
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,898
with a racially divided, visibly
racially divided, society.

123
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:44,182
So this is all very
uncomfortable to talk about.

124
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:47,451
But I think this is the thing,
especially in Europe and for us, too,

125
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:48,668
we need to be looking at.

126
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,778
CA: You're saying that people of reason,

127
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,290
people who would consider
themselves not racists,

128
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:55,041
but moral, upstanding people,

129
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:58,011
have a rationale that says
humans are just too different;

130
00:05:58,035 --> 00:06:03,474
that we're in danger of overloading
our sense of what humans are capable of,

131
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,988
by mixing in people who are too different.

132
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,552
JH: Yes, but I can make it
much more palatable

133
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,374
by saying it's not necessarily about race.

134
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,086
It's about culture.

135
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,283
There's wonderful work by a political
scientist named Karen Stenner,

136
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:21,534
who shows that when people have a sense

137
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:23,793
that we are all united,
we're all the same,

138
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,067
there are many people who have
a predisposition to authoritarianism.

139
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,133
Those people aren't particularly racist

140
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,324
when they feel as through
there's not a threat

141
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,047
to our social and moral order.

142
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,104
But if you prime them experimentally

143
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,260
by thinking we're coming apart,
people are getting more different,

144
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,807
then they get more racist, homophobic,
they want to kick out the deviants.

145
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,738
So it's in part that you get
an authoritarian reaction.

146
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,099
The left, following through
the Lennonist line --

147
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,409
the John Lennon line --

148
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,842
does things that create
an authoritarian reaction.

149
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,661
We're certainly seeing that
in America with the alt-right.

150
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,267
We saw it in Britain,
we've seen it all over Europe.

151
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,873
But the more positive part of that

152
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:03,194
is that I think the localists,
or the nationalists, are actually right --

153
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:07,005
that, if you emphasize
our cultural similarity,

154
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,256
then race doesn't actually
matter very much.

155
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,988
So an assimilationist
approach to immigration

156
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,569
removes a lot of these problems.

157
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:15,980
And if you value having
a generous welfare state,

158
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:18,477
you've got to emphasize
that we're all the same.

159
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,934
CA: OK, so rising immigration
and fears about that

160
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,125
are one of the causes
of the current divide.

161
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,862
What are other causes?

162
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:28,907
JH: The next principle of moral psychology

163
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:32,734
is that intuitions come first,
strategic reasoning second.

164
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:35,238
You've probably heard
the term "motivated reasoning"

165
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:36,869
or "confirmation bias."

166
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,810
There's some really interesting work

167
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,911
on how our high intelligence
and our verbal abilities

168
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:45,137
might have evolved
not to help us find out the truth,

169
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:48,133
but to help us manipulate each other,
defend our reputation ...

170
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:51,123
We're really, really good
at justifying ourselves.

171
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,514
And when you bring
group interests into account,

172
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,275
so it's not just me,
it's my team versus your team,

173
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:59,212
whereas if you're evaluating evidence
that your side is wrong,

174
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,993
we just can't accept that.

175
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,734
So this is why you can't win
a political argument.

176
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:05,251
If you're debating something,

177
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,322
you can't persuade the person
with reasons and evidence,

178
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,691
because that's not
the way reasoning works.

179
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,830
So now, give us the internet,
give us Google:

180
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:17,252
"I heard that Barack Obama
was born in Kenya.

181
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:21,224
Let me Google that -- oh my God!
10 million hits! Look, he was!"

182
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:24,388
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant
surprise to a lot of people.

183
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,260
Social media has often been framed
by techno-optimists

184
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:32,531
as this great connecting force
that would bring people together.

185
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,477
And there have been some
unexpected counter-effects to that.

186
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,073
JH: That's right.

187
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,478
That's why I'm very enamored
of yin-yang views

188
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,120
of human nature and left-right --

189
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:44,610
that each side is right
about certain things,

190
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:46,755
but then it goes blind to other things.

191
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,757
And so the left generally believes
that human nature is good:

192
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,946
bring people together, knock down
the walls and all will be well.

193
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,528
The right -- social conservatives,
not libertarians --

194
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:59,805
social conservatives generally
believe people can be greedy

195
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,211
and sexual and selfish,

196
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,655
and we need regulation,
and we need restrictions.

197
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:06,616
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,

198
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,869
allow people to communicate
all over the world,

199
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,951
you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.

200
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,236
CA: So help us understand.

201
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,812
These principles of human nature
have been with us forever.

202
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:23,692
What's changed that's deepened
this feeling of division?

203
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,016
JH: You have to see six to ten
different threads all coming together.

204
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,066
I'll just list a couple of them.

205
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:35,876
So in America, one of the big --
actually, America and Europe --

206
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,813
one of the biggest ones is World War II.

207
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,480
There's interesting research
from Joe Henrich and others

208
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,907
that says if your country was at war,

209
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,488
especially when you were young,

210
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,626
then we test you 30 years later
in a commons dilemma

211
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,979
or a prisoner's dilemma,

212
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,294
you're more cooperative.

213
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:53,856
Because of our tribal nature, if you're --

214
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,797
my parents were teenagers
during World War II,

215
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,382
and they would go out
looking for scraps of aluminum

216
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:00,595
to help the war effort.

217
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,797
I mean, everybody pulled together.

218
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,350
And so then these people go on,

219
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,772
they rise up through business
and government,

220
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,427
they take leadership positions.

221
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,702
They're really good
at compromise and cooperation.

222
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,661
They all retire by the '90s.

223
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,986
So we're left with baby boomers
by the end of the '90s.

224
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,977
And their youth was spent fighting
each other within each country,

225
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,648
in 1968 and afterwards.

226
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:26,666
The loss of the World War II generation,
"The Greatest Generation,"

227
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,974
is huge.

228
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,742
So that's one.

229
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,563
Another, in America,
is the purification of the two parties.

230
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,996
There used to be liberal Republicans
and conservative Democrats.

231
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,187
So America had a mid-20th century
that was really bipartisan.

232
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:44,578
But because of a variety of factors
that started things moving,

233
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,000
by the 90's, we had a purified
liberal party and conservative party.

234
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,669
So now, the people in either party
really are different,

235
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,176
and we really don't want
our children to marry them,

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,268
which, in the '60s,
didn't matter very much.

237
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,089
So, the purification of the parties.

238
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:59,585
Third is the internet and, as I said,

239
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:04,292
it's just the most amazing stimulant
for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.

240
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:09,108
CA: The tone of what's happening
on the internet now is quite troubling.

241
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,979
I just did a quick search
on Twitter about the election

242
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,923
and saw two tweets next to each other.

243
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:19,547
One, against a picture of racist graffiti:

244
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,640
"This is disgusting!

245
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,834
Ugliness in this country,
brought to us by #Trump."

246
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:26,806
And then the next one is:

247
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,642
"Crooked Hillary
dedication page. Disgusting!"

248
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:35,383
So this idea of "disgust"
is troubling to me.

249
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:38,642
Because you can have an argument
or a disagreement about something,

250
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,227
you can get angry at someone.

251
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:44,687
Disgust, I've heard you say,
takes things to a much deeper level.

252
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,598
JH: That's right. Disgust is different.

253
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,585
Anger -- you know, I have kids.

254
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,359
They fight 10 times a day,

255
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,350
and they love each other 30 times a day.

256
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:55,284
You just go back and forth:
you get angry, you're not angry;

257
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,831
you're angry, you're not angry.

258
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,165
But disgust is different.

259
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:02,662
Disgust paints the person
as subhuman, monstrous,

260
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,495
deformed, morally deformed.

261
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,943
Disgust is like indelible ink.

262
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,283
There's research from John Gottman
on marital therapy.

263
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:16,432
If you look at the faces -- if one
of the couple shows disgust or contempt,

264
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:19,552
that's a predictor that they're going
to get divorced soon,

265
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,475
whereas if they show anger,
that doesn't predict anything,

266
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,208
because if you deal with anger well,
it actually is good.

267
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:26,684
So this election is different.

268
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,362
Donald Trump personally
uses the word "disgust" a lot.

269
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:33,243
He's very germ-sensitive,
so disgust does matter a lot --

270
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:37,177
more for him, that's something
unique to him --

271
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:40,104
but as we demonize each other more,

272
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:43,537
and again, through
the Manichaean worldview,

273
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:46,291
the idea that the world
is a battle between good and evil

274
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:47,662
as this has been ramping up,

275
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:51,012
we're more likely not just to say
they're wrong or I don't like them,

276
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,572
but we say they're evil, they're satanic,

277
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,517
they're disgusting, they're revolting.

278
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,407
And then we want nothing to do with them.

279
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,293
And that's why I think we're seeing it,
for example, on campus now.

280
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,957
We're seeing more the urge
to keep people off campus,

281
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,926
silence them, keep them away.

282
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,545
I'm afraid that this whole
generation of young people,

283
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:13,362
if their introduction to politics
involves a lot of disgust,

284
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:17,091
they're not going to want to be involved
in politics as they get older.

285
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,346
CA: So how do we deal with that?

286
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,850
Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?

287
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:26,822
JH: You can't do it with reasons.

288
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:28,503
I think ...

289
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:33,474
I studied disgust for many years,
and I think about emotions a lot.

290
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:37,023
And I think that the opposite
of disgust is actually love.

291
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:40,855
Love is all about, like ...

292
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,810
Disgust is closing off, borders.

293
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,379
Love is about dissolving walls.

294
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,554
So personal relationships, I think,

295
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,337
are probably the most
powerful means we have.

296
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,988
You can be disgusted by a group of people,

297
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:57,930
but then you meet a particular person

298
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,730
and you genuinely discover
that they're lovely.

299
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:05,050
And then gradually that chips away
or changes your category as well.

300
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:11,993
The tragedy is, Americans used to be
much more mixed up in the their towns

301
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,151
by left-right or politics.

302
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,506
And now that it's become
this great moral divide,

303
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,673
there's a lot of evidence
that we're moving to be near people

304
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,209
who are like us politically.

305
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,763
It's harder to find somebody
who's on the other side.

306
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,077
So they're over there, they're far away.

307
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:27,671
It's harder to get to know them.

308
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:31,919
CA: What would you say to someone
or say to Americans,

309
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,101
people generally,

310
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,734
about what we should understand
about each other

311
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:39,233
that might help us rethink for a minute

312
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:41,460
this "disgust" instinct?

313
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:43,238
JH: Yes.

314
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,415
A really important
thing to keep in mind --

315
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:50,155
there's research by political
scientist Alan Abramowitz,

316
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,172
showing that American democracy
is increasingly governed

317
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:56,439
by what's called "negative partisanship."

318
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,986
That means you think,
OK there's a candidate,

319
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,416
you like the candidate,
you vote for the candidate.

320
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,499
But with the rise of negative advertising

321
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,747
and social media
and all sorts of other trends,

322
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,812
increasingly, the way elections are done

323
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:12,817
is that each side tries to make
the other side so horrible, so awful,

324
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,882
that you'll vote for my guy by default.

325
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,289
And so as we more and more vote
against the other side

326
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,644
and not for our side,

327
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:25,175
you have to keep in mind
that if people are on the left,

328
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,109
they think, "Well, I used to think
that Republicans were bad,

329
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,616
but now Donald Trump proves it.

330
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,491
And now every Republican,
I can paint with all the things

331
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,897
that I think about Trump."

332
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,514
And that's not necessarily true.

333
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:38,230
They're generally not very happy
with their candidate.

334
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:42,970
This is the most negative partisanship
election in American history.

335
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,223
So you have to first separate
your feelings about the candidate

336
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,184
from your feelings about the people
who are given a choice.

337
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,691
And then you have to realize that,

338
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,666
because we all live
in a separate moral world --

339
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,141
the metaphor I use in the book
is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,"

340
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:02,689
or each moral community is a matrix,
a consensual hallucination.

341
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,956
And so if you're within the blue matrix,

342
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,174
everything's completely compelling
that the other side --

343
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:11,829
they're troglodytes, they're racists,
they're the worst people in the world,

344
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,957
and you have all the facts
to back that up.

345
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,256
But somebody in the next house from yours

346
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,313
is living in a different moral matrix.

347
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,284
They live in a different video game,

348
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:22,686
and they see a completely
different set of facts.

349
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,386
And each one sees
different threats to the country.

350
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,500
And what I've found
from being in the middle

351
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:30,451
and trying to understand both sides
is: both sides are right.

352
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:32,595
There are a lot of threats
to this country,

353
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:36,104
and each side is constitutionally
incapable of seeing them all.

354
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:43,482
CA: So, are you saying
that we almost need a new type of empathy?

355
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,676
Empathy is traditionally framed as:

356
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,391
"Oh, I feel your pain.
I can put myself in your shoes."

357
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,344
And we apply it to the poor,
the needy, the suffering.

358
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:55,846
We don't usually apply it
to people who we feel as other,

359
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,335
or we're disgusted by.

360
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,510
JH: No. That's right.

361
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:03,364
CA: What would it look like
to build that type of empathy?

362
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,506
JH: Actually, I think ...

363
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,450
Empathy is a very, very
hot topic in psychology,

364
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:11,132
and it's a very popular word
on the left in particular.

365
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,156
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.

366
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,633
So it's important to empathize

367
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:19,481
with the groups that we on the left
think are so important.

368
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,036
That's easy to do,
because you get points for that.

369
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:26,091
But empathy really should get you points
if you do it when it's hard to do.

370
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,267
And, I think ...

371
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:33,379
You know, we had a long 50-year period
of dealing with our race problems

372
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,658
and legal discrimination,

373
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,869
and that was our top priority
for a long time

374
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,143
and it still is important.

375
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,696
But I think this year,

376
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,124
I'm hoping it will make people see

377
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,943
that we have an existential
threat on our hands.

378
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,634
Our left-right divide, I believe,

379
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,818
is by far the most important
divide we face.

380
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,873
We still have issues about race
and gender and LGBT,

381
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:57,268
but this is the urgent need
of the next 50 years,

382
00:17:57,292 --> 00:18:00,153
and things aren't going
to get better on their own.

383
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,856
So we're going to need to do
a lot of institutional reforms,

384
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,289
and we could talk about that,

385
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:07,643
but that's like a whole long,
wonky conversation.

386
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:11,513
But I think it starts with people
realizing that this is a turning point.

387
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,346
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.

388
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,875
We need to realize:

389
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,441
this is what our country needs,

390
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,819
and this is what you need
if you don't want to --

391
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:22,538
Raise your hand if you want
to spend the next four years

392
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:26,048
as angry and worried as you've been
for the last year -- raise your hand.

393
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,777
So if you want to escape from this,

394
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,952
read Buddha, read Jesus,
read Marcus Aurelius.

395
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:35,038
They have all kinds of great advice
for how to drop the fear,

396
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:36,240
reframe things,

397
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,347
stop seeing other people as your enemy.

398
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:41,678
There's a lot of guidance in ancient
wisdom for this kind of empathy.

399
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,079
CA: Here's my last question:

400
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:47,438
Personally, what can
people do to help heal?

401
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:51,545
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide
to overcome your deepest prejudices.

402
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,030
And there's research showing

403
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:57,403
that political prejudices are deeper
and stronger than race prejudices

404
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,687
in the country now.

405
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:02,827
So I think you have to make an effort --
that's the main thing.

406
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,855
Make an effort to actually meet somebody.

407
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,089
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,

408
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,982
somebody who's on the other side.

409
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,822
So, after this election --

410
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,603
wait a week or two,

411
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:15,463
because it's probably going to feel
awful for one of you --

412
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,639
but wait a couple weeks, and then
reach out and say you want to talk.

413
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:21,087
And before you do it,

414
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:24,256
read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win
Friends and Influence People" --

415
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,319
(Laughter)

416
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:26,510
I'm totally serious.

417
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,124
You'll learn techniques
if you start by acknowledging,

418
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,309
if you start by saying,

419
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,003
"You know, we don't agree on a lot,

420
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:34,565
but one thing I really respect
about you, Uncle Bob,"

421
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,648
or "... about you conservatives, is ... "

422
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,006
And you can find something.

423
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,793
If you start with some
appreciation, it's like magic.

424
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:42,931
This is one of the main
things I've learned

425
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,868
that I take into my human relationships.

426
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,812
I still make lots of stupid mistakes,

427
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,852
but I'm incredibly good
at apologizing now,

428
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,293
and at acknowledging what
somebody was right about.

429
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:52,471
And if you do that,

430
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,989
then the conversation goes really well,
and it's actually really fun.

431
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,362
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating
speaking with you.

432
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:03,144
It really does feel like
the ground that we're on

433
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:08,035
is a ground populated by deep questions
of morality and human nature.

434
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,790
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.

435
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:13,109
Thank you so much for sharing
this time with us.

436
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,285
JH: Thanks, Chris.

437
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:15,470
JH: Thanks, everyone.

438
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,494
(Applause)
