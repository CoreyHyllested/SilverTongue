0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If your life were a book

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and you were the author,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
how would you want your story to go?

4
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:27,002
That's the question
that changed my life forever.

5
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:30,000
Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,992
all I wanted was to be free.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I would daydream about
traveling the world,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
living in a place where it snowed,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and I would picture all of the stories

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that I would go on to tell.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
At the age of 19,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the day after I graduated high school,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I moved to a place where it snowed

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and I became a massage therapist.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With this job all I needed were my hands

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and my massage table by my side

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,240
and I could go anywhere.

18
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,000
For the first time in my life,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,530
I felt free, independent

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,574
and completely in control of my life.

21
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:22,010
That is, until my life took a detour.

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000
I went home from work early one day

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,820
with what I thought was the flu,

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,988
and less than 24 hours later

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I was in the hospital

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
on life support

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,010
with less than a two percent chance of living.

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,520
It wasn't until days later

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
as I lay in a coma

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that the doctors diagnosed me

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
with bacterial meningitis,

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,560
a vaccine-preventable blood infection.

33
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,978
Over the course of two and a half months

34
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:57,670
I lost my spleen, my kidneys,

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,000
the hearing in my left ear

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and both of my legs below the knee.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,824
When my parents
wheeled me out of the hospital

38
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:10,682
I felt like I had been
pieced back together

39
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:14,008
like a patchwork doll.

40
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,000
I thought the worst was over

41
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:19,000
until weeks later when I saw my new legs

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
for the first time.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,790
The calves were bulky blocks of metal

44
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,530
with pipes bolted together for the ankles

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,011
and a yellow rubber foot

46
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,971
with a raised rubber line
from the toe to the ankle

47
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,000
to look like a vein.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I didn't know what to expect,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but I wasn't expecting that.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
With my mom by my side

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,716
and tears streaming down our faces,

52
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:56,000
I strapped on these chunky legs

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,997
and I stood up.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,280
They were so painful and so confining

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,010
that all I could think was,

56
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,710
how am I ever going to travel the world

57
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,000
in these things?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How was I ever going to live

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,728
the life full of adventure and stories,

60
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,000
as I always wanted?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,844
And how was I going to snowboard again?

62
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:25,000
That day, I went home, I crawled into bed

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and this is what my life looked like

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,440
for the next few months:

65
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:33,640
me passed out, escaping from reality,

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,013
with my legs resting by my side.

67
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:46,290
I was absolutely physically
and emotionally broken.

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,000
But I knew that in order to move forward,

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,230
I had to let go of the old Amy

70
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,020
and learn to embrace the new Amy.

71
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,350
And that is when it dawned on me

72
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,080
that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,000
I could be as tall as I wanted!

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,680
(Laughter) (Applause)

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,011
Or as short as I wanted,
depending on who I was dating.

76
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,000
(Laughter)

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,570
And if I snowboarded again,

78
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,430
my feet aren't going to get cold.

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,214
(Laughter)

80
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,450
And best of all, I thought,

81
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,176
I can make my feet the size
of all the shoes

82
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,675
that are on the sales rack.
(Laughter)

83
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,590
And I did!

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,000
So there were benefits here.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,665
It was this moment that I asked myself

86
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:46,590
that life-defining question:

87
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:48,932
If my life were a book

88
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:52,150
and I were the author,

89
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,960
how would I want the story to go?

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,450
And I began to daydream.

91
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,240
I daydreamed like I did as a little girl

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
and I imagined myself

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
walking gracefully,

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,441
helping other people through my journey

95
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,000
and snowboarding again.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I didn't just see myself

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
carving down a mountain of powder,

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I could actually feel it.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I could feel the wind against my face

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and the beat of my racing heart

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,010
as if it were happening
in that very moment.

102
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,400
And that is when a new chapter
in my life began.

103
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,830
Four months later
I was back up on a snowboard,

104
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,420
although things didn't go
quite as expected:

105
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,000
My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,710
and at one point I traumatized
all the skiers on the chair lift

107
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,070
when I fell and my legs,

108
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,000
still attached to my snowboard —

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(Laughter) —

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
went flying down the mountain,

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and I was on top of the mountain still.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was so shocked,

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,308
I was just as shocked as everybody else,
and I was so discouraged,

114
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:15,000
but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that I would be able to do this again.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And this is when I learned
that our borders

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,028
and our obstacles
can only do two things:

118
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:27,000
one, stop us in our tracks

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,190
or two, force us to get creative.

120
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,600
I did a year of research,
still couldn't figure out

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
what kind of legs to use,

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,287
couldn't find any resources
that could help me.

123
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:40,580
So I decided to make a pair myself.

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,637
My leg maker and I
put random parts together

125
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,902
and we made a pair of feet
that I could snowboard in.

126
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:49,000
As you can see,

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
rusted bolts, rubber,
wood and neon pink duct tape.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And yes, I can change my toenail polish.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It was these legs

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,965
and the best 21st birthday gift
I could ever receive —

131
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,452
a new kidney from my dad —

132
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:10,000
that allowed me to follow my dreams again.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I started snowboarding,

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,916
then I went back to work,
then I went back to school.

135
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,605
Then in 2005 I cofounded
a nonprofit organization

136
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,852
for youth and young adults
with physical disabilities

137
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:24,480
so they could get involved
with action sports.

138
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,060
From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,

139
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,255
where I helped to put shoes
on thousands of children's feet

140
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,461
so they could attend school.

141
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:35,670
And just this past February,

142
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,360
I won two back-to-back
World Cup gold medals —

143
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,392
(Applause) —

144
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,750
which made me

145
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,113
the highest ranked
adaptive female snowboarder

146
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:55,740
in the world.

147
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,000
Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,440
I had no idea what to expect.

149
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,000
But if you ask me today,

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
if I would ever want to
change my situation,

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I would have to say no.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because my legs haven't disabled me,

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,540
if anything they've enabled me.

154
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,000
They've forced me to rely on my imagination

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and to believe in the possibilities,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,780
and that's why I believe

157
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,000
that our imaginations can be used as tools

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
for breaking through borders,

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
because in our minds,
we can do anything

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and we can be anything.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's believing in those dreams

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and facing our fears head-on

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,570
that allows us to live our lives

164
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,490
beyond our limits.

165
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,860
And although today is about
innovation without borders,

166
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,000
I have to say that in my life,

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,428
innovation has only been possible

168
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:54,600
because of my borders.

169
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,005
I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,

170
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,000
but also where the imagination

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,930
and the story begins.

172
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,916
So the thought that I would like
to challenge you with today

173
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,994
is that maybe instead of looking at
our challenges and our limitations

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
as something negative or bad,

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we can begin to look at them as blessings,

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,525
magnificent gifts that can be used
to ignite our imaginations

177
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:29,015
and help us go further
than we ever knew we could go.

178
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,000
It's not about breaking down borders.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,330
It's about pushing off of them

180
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,000
and seeing what amazing places

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
they might bring us.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,540
Thank you.
