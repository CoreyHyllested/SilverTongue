00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:20,444
(Guitar music)

1
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,982
I was just thinking

2
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,530
that I have been missing you way too long

3
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:42,694
There's something inside this weary head

4
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:47,744
that wants us to love just instead

5
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,913
But I was just thinking,

6
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,599
merely thinking

7
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:03,923
I've got loads of pictures,

8
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:11,055
I've got the one of you
in that dancing dress

9
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,197
But man I feel silly in that dim light

10
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:21,654
Just after doing you
by the sight of my Kodak delights,

11
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:26,050
I am sinking,

12
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:29,131
merely sinking

13
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:39,868
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

14
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm a singer without a song

15
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:47,345
If I wait for you longer

16
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,799
my affection is stronger

17
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:56,816
and I ... I was just thinking,

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,256
merely thinking

19
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:07,976
that this boat is sinking

20
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:22,674
I'm tired of postcards,

21
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:29,802
especially the ones
with cute dogs and cupids

22
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,910
I'm tired of calling you and missing you

23
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,815
and dreaming I slept with you

24
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:42,099
Don't get me wrong
I still desperately love you

25
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:45,876
inside this weary head

26
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,560
I just want us to love just instead

27
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:56,413
But I was just thinking and thinking,

28
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:00,062
merely thinking

29
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:10,290
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

30
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:15,040
and time is running me still

31
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,644
If I wait for you longer

32
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:21,602
my affection is stronger

33
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:26,922
I ... I was just thinking

34
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:36,950
I ... I was just thinking

35
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,631
that I'm tired of calling you once a week

36
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:49,981
thinking of long distance rates
instead of kissing you

37
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:55,904
So baby I'm sinking,

38
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:58,102
merely sinking

39
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,788
(Guitar music ends)

40
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,513
(Applause)

41
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,022
Thank you.

42
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,579
Singing is sharing.

43
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:20,608
When you sing, you have to know
what you're talking about intimately,

44
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,918
and you have to be willing
to share this insight

45
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,031
and give away a piece of yourself.

46
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:30,568
I look for this intention
to share in everything,

47
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:36,199
and I ask: what are the intentions
behind this architecture or this product

48
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,274
or this restaurant or this meal?

49
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,980
And if your intentions
are to impress people

50
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,610
or to get the big applause at the end,

51
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,872
then you are taking, not giving.

52
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:50,662
And this is a song that's about --

53
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,384
it's the kind of song that everyone
has their version of.

54
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,572
This song is called "Home,"

55
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,342
and it's sort of a "This is where
I'm from, nice to meet you all,"

56
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,518
kind of song.

57
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,739
(Laughter)

58
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:06,539
(Applause)

59
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,186
(Piano music)

60
00:05:55,179 --> 00:06:01,262
Home is the sound of birds
early in the morning

61
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:06,545
Home is a song I've always remembered

62
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,564
Home is the memory
of my first day in school

63
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:16,227
Home is the books that I carry around

64
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,732
Home is an alley in a faraway town

65
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:26,584
Home is the places I’ve been
and where I’d like to go

66
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:32,957
Home

67
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:37,251
I'm always gonna feel at home

68
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:41,885
No matter where I may roam

69
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:46,226
I'm always gonna find my way back home

70
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,051
No matter how far I’m gone

71
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:57,003
I’m always gonna feel this longing

72
00:06:57,027 --> 00:07:02,898
No matter where I might stay

73
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,695
Home is a feather twirling in the air

74
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,828
Home is flowers in a windowsill

75
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:21,298
Home is all the things she said to me

76
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:26,227
Home is a photo I never threw away

77
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:31,640
Home is the smile on my face when I die

78
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:37,949
Home is the taste of an apple pie

79
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:50,660
I met a woman, she always lived
in the same place

80
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:57,373
And she said home is where
you’re born and raised

81
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,518
And I met a man, he sat
looking out to the sea

82
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:13,600
And he said home is where you want to be

83
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,985
I met a girl in some downtown bar

84
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:29,199
And she said I'll have
whatever he's having

85
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:37,170
And I asked her how come
we never met before?

86
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:45,346
And she said all my life I’ve been trying

87
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,107
to get a place of my own

88
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:53,049
I’m always gonna feel at home

89
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,265
No matter where I may roam

90
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,777
Always gonna find my way back home

91
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:06,331
No matter how far I’m gone

92
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:12,478
I'm always gonna feel this longing

93
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:19,185
No matter where I might stay

94
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,033
(Piano music)

95
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
(Piano music ends)

96
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,146
(Applause)
