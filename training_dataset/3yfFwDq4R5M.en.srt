00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,373
Today, I want to talk to you about dreams.

1
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,716
I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,716
and it's cooler than in the movies.

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,683
(Laughter)

4
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:25,415
Beyond flying, breathing fire,

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,280
and making hot men
spontaneously appear ...

6
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:30,281
(Laughter)

7
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:32,713
I can do things like read and write music.

8
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:36,675
Fun fact is that I wrote
my personal statement to college

9
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,019
in a dream.

10
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:40,798
And I did accepted. So, yeah.

11
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,679
I am a very visual thinker.

12
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,642
I think in pictures, not words.

13
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:51,405
To me, words are more like
instincts and language.

14
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:53,745
There are many people like me;

15
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,283
Nikola Tesla, for example,

16
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:01,322
who could visualize, design,
test, and troubleshoot everything --

17
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:04,752
all of his inventions --
in his mind, accurately.

18
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,975
Language is kind of exclusive
to our species, anyway.

19
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,109
I am a bit more primitive,

20
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,701
like a beta version of Google Translate.

21
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,337
(Laughter)

22
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,624
My brain has the ability
to hyper-focus on things that interest me.

23
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,974
For example, once
I had an affair with calculus

24
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,687
that lasted longer
than some celebrity marriages.

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,638
(Laughter)

26
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:35,043
There are some other
unusual things about me.

27
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,217
You may have noticed
that I don't have much inflection

28
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,455
in my voice.

29
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,540
That's why people
often confuse me with a GPS.

30
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:47,438
(Laughter)

31
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:51,981
This can make basic communication
a challenge, unless you need directions.

32
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:56,420
(Laughter)

33
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:57,618
Thank you.

34
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:01,869
(Applause)

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,839
A few years ago, when I started
doing presentations,

36
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:08,492
I went to get head shots done
for the first time.

37
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,124
The photographer told me to look flirty.

38
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,417
(Laughter)

39
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,030
And I had no idea
what she was talking about.

40
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,700
(Laughter)

41
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:21,152
She said, "Do that thing,
you know, with your eyes,

42
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:23,077
when you're flirting with guys."

43
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,192
"What thing?" I asked.

44
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,061
"You know, squint."

45
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,237
And so I tried, really.

46
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,922
It looked something like this.

47
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,843
(Laughter)

48
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,490
I looked like I was searching for Waldo.

49
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,900
(Laughter)

50
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,314
There's a reason for this,

51
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,907
as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.

52
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,378
(Laughter)

53
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,506
I have Asperger's,

54
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,522
a high-functioning form of autism

55
00:02:56,546 --> 00:03:00,022
that impairs the basic social skills
one is expected to display.

56
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,810
It's made life difficult in many ways,

57
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:09,574
and growing up,
I struggled to fit in socially.

58
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:13,582
My friends would tell jokes,
but I didn't understand them.

59
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,976
My personal heroes were George Carlin
and Stephen Colbert --

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,381
and they taught me humor.

61
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,687
My personality switched
from being shy and awkward

62
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:29,504
to being defiant and cursing out a storm.

63
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:33,055
Needless to say,
I did not have many friends.

64
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,992
I was also hypersensitive to texture.

65
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:40,409
The feel of water on my skin
was like pins and needles,

66
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,727
and so for years, I refused to shower.

67
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:47,219
I can assure you that my hygiene routine
is up to standards now, though.

68
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,876
(Laughter)

69
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:54,880
I had to do a lot to get here,
and my parents --

70
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:59,533
things kind of got out of control
when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,

71
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:04,357
and on top of everything,
it made a difficult situation worse.

72
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:10,833
And I had to travel 2,000 miles
across the country to get treatment,

73
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:14,531
but within days of them prescribing
a new medication,

74
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,307
my life turned into an episode
of the Walking Dead.

75
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,221
I became paranoid,
and began to hallucinate

76
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:24,269
that rotting corpses
were coming towards me.

77
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,611
My family finally rescued me,

78
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:32,324
but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds
in those three weeks,

79
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,777
as well as developing severe anemia,

80
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,562
and was on the verge of suicide.

81
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,855
I transferred to a new treatment center
that understood my aversions,

82
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,560
my trauma, and my social anxiety,

83
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,900
and they knew how to treat it,
and I got the help I finally needed.

84
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,774
And after 18 months of hard work,

85
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:55,890
I went on to do incredible things.

86
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,138
One of the things with Asperger's
is that oftentimes,

87
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,255
these people have
a very complex inner life,

88
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,120
and I know for myself,
I have a very colorful personality,

89
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:08,848
rich ideas, and just a lot
going on in my mind.

90
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:12,245
But there's a gap
between where that stands,

91
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,860
and how I communicate it
with the rest of the world.

92
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,892
And this can make
basic communication a challenge.

93
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:23,365
Not many places would hire me,
due to my lack of social skills,

94
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,689
which is why I applied to Waffle House.

95
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:31,300
(Laughter)

96
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,748
Waffle House is an exceptional
24-hour diner --

97
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,725
(Laughter)

98
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:41,003
(Applause)

99
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:42,967
thank you --

100
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,750
where you can order your hash browns

101
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:47,927
the many ways that someone
would dispose of a human corpse ...

102
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:49,584
(Laughter)

103
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:54,337
Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked,
topped, capped, and covered.

104
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,464
(Laughter)

105
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,933
As social norms would have it,

106
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,454
you should only go to Waffle House
at an ungodly hour in the night.

107
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:02,629
(Laughter)

108
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:07,009
So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting
with a waitress, and I asked her,

109
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,303
"What's the most ridiculous thing
that's happened to you on the job?"

110
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:14,136
And she told me that one time,
a man walked in completely naked.

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,390
(Laughter)

112
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,262
I said, "Great! Sign me up
for the graveyard shift!"

113
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,890
(Laughter)

114
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,705
Needless to say,
Waffle House did not hire me.

115
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:30,218
So in terms of having Asperger's,
it can be viewed as a disadvantage,

116
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:32,409
and sometimes it is
a real pain in the butt,

117
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,187
but it's also the opposite.

118
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:37,802
It's a gift, and it allows me
to think innovatively.

119
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:45,640
At 19, I won a research competition
for my research on coral reefs,

120
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,179
and I ended up speaking

121
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,454
at the UN Convention
of Biological Diversity,

122
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,974
presenting this research.

123
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:52,686
(Applause)

124
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,868
Thank you.

125
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:58,790
(Applause)

126
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:02,809
And at 22, I'm getting ready
to graduate college,

127
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,368
and I am a co-founder of a biotech
company called AutismSees.

128
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,283
(Applause)

129
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:10,562
Thank you.

130
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,263
(Applause)

131
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,471
But consider what I had to do to get here:

132
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:21,786
25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,
and years of pain and trauma.

133
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,769
I spent a lot of time thinking
if there's a better way,

134
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,845
and I think there is:
autism-assistive technology.

135
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:32,520
This technology
could play an integral role

136
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:35,399
in helping people
with autistic spectrum disorder,

137
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,577
or ASD.

138
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:43,431
The app Podium, released
by my company, AutismSees,

139
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:48,729
has the ability to independently assess
and help develop communication skills.

140
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:53,646
In addition to this, it tracks
eye contact through camera

141
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:59,577
and simulates a public-speaking
and job-interview experience.

142
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,118
And so maybe one day,
Waffle House will hire me,

143
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,322
after practicing on it some more.

144
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,527
(Laughter)

145
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:14,681
And one of the great things
is that I've used Podium

146
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:19,791
to help me prepare for today,
and it's been a great help.

147
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:21,442
But it's more than that.

148
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,020
There's more that can be done.

149
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:27,366
For people with ASD --

150
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,907
it has been speculated
that many innovative scientists,

151
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:36,522
researchers, artists,
and engineers have it;

152
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:42,576
like, for example, Emily Dickinson,
Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,337
are some examples.

154
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,114
But the problem that's encountered

155
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:49,975
is that these brilliant ideas
often can't be shared

156
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,263
if there are communication roadblocks.

157
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:57,975
And so, many people with autism
are being overlooked every day,

158
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,809
and they're being taken advantage of.

159
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:08,070
So my dream for people with autism
is to change that,

160
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:11,021
to remove the roadblocks
that prevent them from succeeding.

161
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:14,310
One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming

162
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,216
is because it allows me to be free,

163
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,305
without judgment of social
and physical consequences.

164
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:24,640
When I'm flying over scenes
that I create in my mind,

165
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,893
I am at peace.

166
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,366
I am free from judgment,

167
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,406
and so I can do whatever I want, you know?

168
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,334
I'm making out with Brad Pitt,
and Angelina is totally cool with it.

169
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,238
(Laughter)

170
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,658
But the goal of autism-assistive
technology is bigger than that,

171
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,043
and more important.

172
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:49,646
My goal is to shift people's perspective

173
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,650
of autism and people
with higher-functioning Asperger's

174
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:58,538
because there is a lot they can do.

175
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:01,998
I mean, look at
Temple Grandin, for example.

176
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:07,117
And by doing so, we allow people
to share their talents with this world

177
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,508
and move this world forward.

178
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:12,754
In addition, we give them the courage
to pursue their dreams

179
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,066
in the real world, in real time.

180
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,249
Thank you.

181
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:19,921
(Applause)

182
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:21,096
Thank you.

183
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,960
(Applause)
