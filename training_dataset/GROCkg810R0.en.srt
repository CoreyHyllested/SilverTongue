00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:14,838
What I want you all to do right now

2
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:19,029
is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.

3
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,877
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal

4
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:26,205
is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.

5
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:29,267
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,

6
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,339
they simply will not work.

7
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,029
That's the first thing.

8
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:38,706
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities

9
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,860
of this mammal, if we study this mammal,

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,422
we're going to get great insight into our diseases

11
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:50,958
of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.

12
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:55,728
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal

13
00:00:55,728 --> 00:01:00,922
is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth

14
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:04,977
lies deep within its DNA.

15
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,285
So are you all thinking?

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:09,779
So,

17
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,881
magnificent creature, isn't it?

18
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:16,233
Who here thought of a bat?

19
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,864
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me,

20
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:22,087
and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.

21
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:26,345
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years

22
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:30,744
to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.

23
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:34,506
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat,

24
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,918
and they have very unique attributes.

25
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,946
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet

26
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:43,929
for about 64 million years.

27
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,394
One of the most unique things that bats do

28
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:50,195
as a mammal is that they fly.

29
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,530
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,473
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:

31
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,833
once in the bats, once in the birds,

32
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,928
and once in the pterodactyls.

33
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:06,774
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.

34
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:10,704
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.

35
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:15,090
But one other extremely unique thing about bats

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,139
is that they are able to use sound

37
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:21,935
to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.

38
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,599
Now, what I mean by echolocation --

39
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,104
they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth

40
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:32,000
or through their nose. This sound wave comes out

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,087
and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,

42
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,947
and the bats then hear these echoes

43
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:42,465
and they turn this information into an acoustic image.

44
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:47,093
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.

45
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:50,518
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.

46
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:53,713
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized

47
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:57,654
that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly

48
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:00,629
and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.

49
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,653
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show

50
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:06,892
that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.

51
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:10,860
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,158
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel

53
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,663
once said, "To truly experience an alien life form

54
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:21,403
on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room

55
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:25,528
with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."

56
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:28,599
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics

57
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,556
on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,

58
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:34,350
you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated

59
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,689
to be able to make sound and perceive it.

60
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:42,253
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.

61
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:46,142
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize

62
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,416
sound is very important for its survival.

63
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,785
Most bats look like the previous one.

64
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:57,824
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.

65
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,823
They do not perceive their environment using sound,

66
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,569
and these are the flying foxes.

67
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,839
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,

68
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:09,064
you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,

69
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:12,249
and if you just look at their face, you can see

70
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:15,787
they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.

71
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:19,309
So among and within bats is a huge variation

72
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,200
in their ability to use sensory perception.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,253
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going

74
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,016
to tell you later during the talk.

75
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:31,095
Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,

76
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,964
and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick

77
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,168
looking at very large images of bats,

78
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:40,057
that's probably not that surprising,

79
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,384
because here in Western culture,

80
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,141
bats have been demonized.

81
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,805
Really, of course the famous book "Dracula,"

82
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,888
written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,

83
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,945
probably is mainly responsible for this.

84
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:55,025
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact

85
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,308
that bats come out at night, and we don't

86
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:59,960
really understand them. We're a little frightened by things

87
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,260
that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.

88
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,319
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.

89
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,184
They are the perpetrators in horror movies,

90
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,991
such as this famous "Nightwing."

91
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,752
Also, if you think about it, demons

92
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:17,467
always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically --

93
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,336
or angels have bird wings.

94
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:25,445
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight

95
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:30,144
is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,

96
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,073
that they perceive bats as

97
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:36,657
creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk

98
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:41,001
into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.

99
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,183
This is considered the Five Blessings.

100
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,845
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word

101
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,936
for "happiness," and they believe that bats

102
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:53,297
bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.

103
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:56,657
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity

104
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,755
surrounded by five bats.

105
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,438
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you

106
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:06,024
and to show you that at least three of these blessings

107
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:09,393
are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats

108
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:13,656
we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.

109
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:18,707
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?

110
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:22,217
Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems

111
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:25,889
to function correctly. And why is this?

112
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,003
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.

113
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,995
They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds

114
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:37,103
of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating

115
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:40,756
the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry

116
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,717
in Mexico. So indeed, we need them

117
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,109
for our ecosystems to function properly.

118
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:48,844
Without them, it's going to be a problem.

119
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:54,366
But most bats are voracious insect predators.

120
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:57,242
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony

121
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,393
of big brown bats, that they will feed

122
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:02,963
on over a million insects a year,

123
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,906
and in the United States of America, right now

124
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:09,247
bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.

125
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,487
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out

126
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:16,247
populations of bats, and scientists have estimated

127
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:21,204
that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now

128
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,918
remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.

129
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,330
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.

130
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,169
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now

131
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,893
bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.

132
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,191
They're going to -- They are very threatened

133
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:38,736
in the United States of America alone.

134
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,277
Now how can this help us?

135
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:43,942
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats

136
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,336
from the equation, we're going to have to then use

137
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,277
insecticides to remove all those pest insects

138
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:52,352
that feed on our agricultural crops.

139
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:56,000
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,942
that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,

141
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:03,465
if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.

142
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:05,921
They maintain the health of our ecosystems,

143
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:08,410
and also they save us money.

144
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,297
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important

145
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,953
for our ecosystems.

146
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:17,953
And what about the second? What about health?

147
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:22,615
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.

148
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,265
Your genome is made up of your DNA,

149
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:28,457
your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function

150
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:31,377
and interact and be as you are.

151
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:35,839
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,

152
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,962
it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome

153
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:44,091
in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.

154
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,631
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized

155
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:50,448
that there's variations within our genome.

156
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,642
So I want you to look at the person beside you.

157
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,721
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize

158
00:08:55,721 --> 00:09:00,365
is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.

159
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,630
And one of the grand challenges right now

160
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,226
in modern molecular medicine is to work out

161
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:10,068
whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,

162
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,979
or does this variation just make you different?

163
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,385
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation

164
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:19,204
actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this

165
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:23,098
new molecular data and personalized genomic information

166
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,499
that is coming online that we will be able to have

167
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,571
in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate

168
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:31,787
between the two. So how do we do this?

169
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:35,115
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.

170
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:39,960
So through natural selection, over time,

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,077
mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein

172
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,698
will not be tolerated over time.

173
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:51,892
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.

174
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,153
And so therefore, if you look at the same region

175
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:57,304
of a genome in many mammals that have been

176
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,808
evolutionarily distant from each other

177
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,271
and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better

178
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,033
understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,

179
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,912
i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,

180
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,232
for its survival, it will be the same

181
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:18,983
in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.

182
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,260
So therefore, if we were to do this,

183
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,729
what we'd need to do is sequence that region

184
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:26,844
in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same

185
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:30,851
or if it's different. So if it is the same,

186
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,960
this indicates that that site is important for a function,

187
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,823
so a disease mutation should fall within that site.

188
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:41,560
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at

189
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,824
have a yellow-type genome at that site,

190
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,486
it probably suggests that purple is bad.

191
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:50,960
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals

192
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,632
that are doing things slightly differently.

193
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,710
So say, for example, the region of the genome

194
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,239
that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.

195
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,913
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,

196
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,747
such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well

197
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,519
have the purple type, we know that this is probably

198
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,894
what's causing this disease.

199
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:17,087
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different

200
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,435
types of diseases of the senses.

201
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,243
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?

202
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:28,189
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and

203
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,780
45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,

204
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,995
and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,

205
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,166
so we want to try and better understand

206
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,771
which mutations in the gene cause the disease.

207
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:45,679
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000

208
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,195
newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,

209
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:52,253
over half of us will also have a hearing problem.

210
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,530
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.

211
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,177
So what we've been doing in my lab

212
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,291
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,

213
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,839
and we have looked at genes that cause blindness

214
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,188
when there's a defect in them,

215
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:08,731
genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,

216
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:13,721
and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.

217
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,602
So bats are also important for our health,

218
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:21,492
to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.

219
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,911
So this is where we are right now,

220
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,811
but what about the future?

221
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,467
What about longevity?

222
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:31,208
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before,

223
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,287
I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth

224
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,996
lies within the bat genome.

225
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:40,112
So why should we be interested in aging at all?

226
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,600
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,416
of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered

228
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:50,051
one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,

229
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:53,013
aspects of all of biology, and really,

230
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:57,389
since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.

231
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,434
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.

232
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:04,063
In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be

233
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,878
a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,

234
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:11,615
and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.

235
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:14,456
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration

236
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:19,218
causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.

237
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:23,732
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie

238
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,413
within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard

239
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:30,371
a guess over how long this bat could live for?

240
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,396
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?

241
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,292
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?

242
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:41,144
Some? How about 30?

243
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:45,019
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.

244
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,670
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.

245
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,858
It lived for up to 42 years,

246
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:53,193
and this bat's still alive in the wild today.

247
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:55,775
But what would be so amazing about this?

248
00:13:55,775 --> 00:14:00,857
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship

249
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,357
between body size, metabolic rate,

250
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,493
and how long you can live for, and you can predict

251
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,720
how long a mammal can live for given its body size.

252
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,415
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.

253
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,154
Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.

254
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,970
As you can see here on this graph, in blue,

255
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,536
these are all other mammals, but bats

256
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,704
can live up to nine times longer than expected

257
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:25,846
despite having a really, really high metabolic rate,

258
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:28,481
and the question is, how can they do that?

259
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:32,022
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer

260
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,798
than expected, given their body size, than man,

261
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:37,646
and 18 of those are bats.

262
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:42,582
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA

263
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,427
that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,

264
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,333
particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy

265
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,873
than a mammal of the same size,

266
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,485
but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.

267
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:57,830
So right now, in my lab, we're combining

268
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,741
state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching

269
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:04,550
the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,

270
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,021
modern molecular technology to understand better

271
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:12,549
what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.

272
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,709
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.

273
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,308
Aging is a big problem for humanity,

274
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:22,244
and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover

275
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:25,116
the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals

276
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:28,325
to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out

277
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:31,557
what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,

278
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,116
we can enable us to do the same thing.

279
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:39,392
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.

280
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:43,283
Just imagine what that would be like.

281
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:46,168
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them

282
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:51,222
as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.

283
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:55,068
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit

284
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:57,620
if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,

285
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,526
they allow us to understand how our genome functions,

286
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,755
and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.

287
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,370
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up

288
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,869
in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,

289
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,869
I want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)
