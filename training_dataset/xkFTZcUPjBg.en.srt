0
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,825
I'll begin today

1
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,891
by sharing a poem

2
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,026
written by my friend from Malawi,

3
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,162
Eileen Piri.

4
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:25,506
Eileen is only 13 years old,

5
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:31,380
but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote,

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,248
I found her poem so interesting,

7
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,245
so motivating.

8
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,358
So I'll read it to you.

9
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,503
She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want."

10
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,359
(Laughter)

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,890
"I'll marry when I want.

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,790
My mother can't force me to marry.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,994
My father cannot force me to marry.

14
00:00:57,526 --> 00:01:00,336
My uncle, my aunt,

15
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,681
my brother or sister,

16
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,863
cannot force me to marry.

17
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:08,254
No one in the world

18
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:11,550
can force me to marry.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,499
I'll marry when I want.

20
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,077
Even if you beat me,

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,747
even if you chase me away,

22
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,928
even if you do anything bad to me,

23
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:26,364
I'll marry when I want.

24
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:29,267
I'll marry when I want,

25
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:33,005
but not before I am well educated,

26
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,323
and not before I am all grown up.

27
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:39,810
I'll marry when I want."

28
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:43,827
This poem might seem odd,

29
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:47,356
written by a 13-year-old girl,

30
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:52,139
but where I and Eileen come from,

31
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,900
this poem, which I have just read to you,

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,616
is a warrior's cry.

33
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,541
I am from Malawi.

34
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,115
Malawi is one of the poorest countries,

35
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,994
very poor,

36
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:14,522
where gender equality is questionable.

37
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:16,844
Growing up in that country,

38
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:20,095
I couldn't make my own choices in life.

39
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,393
I couldn't even explore

40
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,389
personal opportunities in life.

41
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,919
I will tell you a story

42
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,381
of two different girls,

43
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:34,026
two beautiful girls.

44
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,580
These girls grew up

45
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,693
under the same roof.

46
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,410
They were eating the same food.

47
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,173
Sometimes, they would share clothes,

48
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,982
and even shoes.

49
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:51,649
But their lives ended up differently,

50
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,646
in two different paths.

51
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,754
The other girl is my little sister.

52
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:03,677
My little sister was only 11 years old

53
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:06,329
when she got pregnant.

54
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,742
It's a hurtful thing.

55
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:16,633
Not only did it hurt her, even me.

56
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:20,232
I was going through a hard time as well.

57
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:23,947
As it is in my culture,

58
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:26,942
once you reach puberty stage,

59
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:30,820
you are supposed to go
to initiation camps.

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,118
In these initiation camps,

61
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:36,973
you are taught how
to sexually please a man.

62
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:38,761
There is this special day,

63
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,965
which they call "Very Special Day"

64
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:44,519
where a man who is hired
by the community

65
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,143
comes to the camp

66
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,572
and sleeps with the little girls.

67
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,766
Imagine the trauma that these young girls

68
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,516
go through every day.

69
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,925
Most girls end up pregnant.

70
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,542
They even contract HIV and AIDS

71
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,882
and other sexually transmitted diseases.

72
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:12,603
For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant.

73
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:16,666
Today, she's only 16 years old

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,662
and she has three children.

75
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:23,307
Her first marriage did not survive,

76
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,604
nor did her second marriage.

77
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:30,781
On the other side, there is this girl.

78
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,314
She's amazing.

79
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,218
(Laughter)

80
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,163
(Applause)

81
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:42,138
I call her amazing because she is.

82
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:45,203
She's very fabulous.

83
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,964
That girl is me. (Laughter)

84
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,982
When I was 13 years old,

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:55,396
I was told, you are grown up,

86
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,228
you have now reached of age,

87
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:01,595
you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp.

88
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,567
I was like, "What?

89
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:08,549
I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps."

90
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:13,112
You know what the women said to me?

91
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,734
"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.

92
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:24,001
You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community."

93
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,809
I said no because I knew
where I was going.

94
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,433
I knew what I wanted in life.

95
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:34,738
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.

96
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:39,883
I wanted to get well educated,

97
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,363
to find a decent job in the future.

98
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:44,122
I was imagining myself as a lawyer,

99
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,832
seated on that big chair.

100
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:49,138
Those were the imaginations that

101
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:52,468
were going through my mind every day.

102
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,302
And I knew that one day,

103
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:58,876
I would contribute something,
a little something to my community.

104
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:01,407
But every day after refusing,

105
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,427
women would tell me,

106
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,817
"Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby.

107
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,303
What about you?"

108
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:13,017
That was the music
that I was hearing every day,

109
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:16,894
and that is the music
that girls hear every day

110
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:21,043
when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do.

111
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:27,448
When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister,

112
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:32,185
I said, "Why can't I do something?

113
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:37,246
Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time

114
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,661
in our community?"

115
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,169
That was when I called other girls

116
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,723
just like my sister, who have children,

117
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:48,187
who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write.

118
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:50,297
I said, "Come on, we can
remind each other

119
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,432
how to read and write again,

120
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:56,240
how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book."

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,885
It was a great time I had with them.

122
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:04,157
Nor did I just learn a little about them,

123
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,594
but they were able to tell me
their personal stories,

124
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,405
what they were facing every day

125
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,075
as young mothers.

126
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,072
That was when I was like,

127
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:17,996
'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us

128
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:21,873
and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders,

129
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,870
that these are the wrong things?"

130
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,937
It was a scary thing to do,

131
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,910
because these traditional leaders,

132
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,114
they are already accustomed to the things

133
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:32,554
that have been there for ages.

134
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,481
A hard thing to change,

135
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,105
but a good thing to try.

136
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,357
So we tried.

137
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,865
It was very hard, but we pushed.

138
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:45,109
And I'm here to say that in my community,

139
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:47,669
it was the first community after girls

140
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,036
pushed so hard to our traditional leader,

141
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:55,425
and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married

142
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,654
before the age of 18.

143
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:01,507
(Applause)

144
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,243
In my community,

145
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,890
that was the first time a community,

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,351
they had to call the bylaws,

147
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:15,858
the first bylaw that protected girls

148
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,052
in our community.

149
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:19,840
We did not stop there.

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,789
We forged ahead.

151
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,643
We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community,

152
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:29,429
but even in other communities.

153
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:33,562
When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February,

154
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:37,208
we were there at the Parliament house.

155
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,294
Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering,

156
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:44,383
we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?"

157
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:49,142
And we don't have
much technology like here,

158
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,139
but we have our small phones.

159
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,169
So we said, "Why can't we get
their numbers and text them?"

160
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:59,428
So we did that. It was a good thing.

161
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:01,448
(Applause)

162
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:04,421
So when the bill passed,
we texted them back,

163
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:06,849
"Thank you for supporting the bill."

164
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:07,919
(Laughter)

165
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,264
And when the bill was signed
by the president,

166
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,630
making it into law, it was a plus.

167
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,482
Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18.

168
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:24,127
(Applause)

169
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:30,071
It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed,

170
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:33,113
but let me tell you this:

171
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:37,501
There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age,

172
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,773
but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day?

173
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:47,416
Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away.

174
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:53,870
This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment.

175
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,239
In honoring this commitment,

176
00:09:56,239 --> 00:10:01,951
it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time.

177
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,712
We don't have to be subjected as second,

178
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:09,950
but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room,

179
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,000
we are not just women,
we are not just girls,

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,980
we are extraordinary.

181
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,893
We can do more.

182
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:19,888
And another thing for Malawi,

183
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:22,790
and not just Malawi but other countries:

184
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,575
The laws which are there,

185
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:32,426
you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced?

186
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:35,839
The law which has just recently passed

187
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,463
and the laws that in other countries
have been there,

188
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,387
they need to be publicized
at the local level,

189
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:44,570
at the community level,

190
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,956
where girls' issues are very striking.

191
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:54,716
Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day.

192
00:10:55,274 --> 00:11:00,359
So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them,

193
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,145
they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves

194
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,816
because they will know that
there is a law that protects them.

195
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:13,363
And another thing I would say is that

196
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:17,961
girls' voices and women's voices

197
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,724
are beautiful, they are there,

198
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:23,905
but we cannot do this alone.

199
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:26,575
Male advocates, they have to jump in,

200
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,525
to step in and work together.

201
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,103
It's a collective work.

202
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:33,843
What we need is what girls elsewhere need:

203
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:39,601
good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11.

204
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,953
And furthermore,

205
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,018
I know that together,

206
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:51,966
we can transform the legal,

207
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:55,135
the cultural and political framework

208
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:59,906
that denies girls of their rights.

209
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:04,964
I am standing here today

210
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:12,004
and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation.

211
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,860
This is the moment

212
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,294
where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide,

213
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:21,895
will be able to say,

214
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:25,099
"I will marry when I want."

215
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:28,144
(Applause)

216
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,219
Thank you. (Applause)
