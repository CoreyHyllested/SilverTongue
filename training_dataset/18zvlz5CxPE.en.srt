0
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,641
Someone who looks like me
walks past you in the street.

1
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:20,751
Do you think they're a mother,

2
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,199
a refugee

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,253
or a victim of oppression?

4
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,454
Or do you think they're a cardiologist,

5
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:27,496
a barrister

6
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,285
or maybe your local politician?

7
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,283
Do you look me up and down,

8
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,775
wondering how hot I must get

9
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:37,504
or if my husband has forced me
to wear this outfit?

10
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,261
What if I wore my scarf like this?

11
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,763
I can walk down the street
in the exact same outfit

12
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:49,420
and what the world expects of me
and the way I'm treated

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,771
depends on the arrangement
of this piece of cloth.

14
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,885
But this isn't going to be
another monologue about the hijab

15
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,861
because Lord knows, Muslim women
are so much more than the piece of cloth

16
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:03,820
they choose, or not,
to wrap their head in.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,564
This is about looking beyond your bias.

18
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:10,084
What if I walked past you and later on

19
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:13,678
you'd found out that actually
I was a race car engineer,

20
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:17,122
and that I designed my own race car
and I ran my university's race team,

21
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,627
because it's true.

22
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:24,127
What if I told you that I was actually
trained as a boxer for five years,

23
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,654
because that's true, too.

24
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,038
Would it surprise you?

25
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:30,527
Why?

26
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,319
Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,347
that surprise and the behaviors
associated with it

28
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,000
are the product of something
called unconscious bias,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,372
or implicit prejudice.

30
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:43,613
And that results in the
ridiculously detrimental

31
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,351
lack of diversity in our workforce,

32
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,714
particularly in areas of influence.

33
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:50,246
Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.

34
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,318
(Applause)

35
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:55,327
Let me just set something out
from the outset:

36
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:58,689
Unconscious bias is not the same
as conscious discrimination.

37
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,199
I'm not saying that in all of you,
there's a secret sexist or racist

38
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,841
or ageist lurking within,
waiting to get out.

39
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,578
That's not what I'm saying.

40
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:08,530
We all have our biases.

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,869
They're the filters through which
we see the world around us.

42
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,844
I'm not accusing anyone,

43
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,338
bias is not an accusation.

44
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:17,879
Rather, it's something that
has to be identified,

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,082
acknowledged and mitigated against.

46
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,476
Bias can be about race,

47
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,680
it can be about gender.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,383
It can also be about class,
education, disability.

49
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:30,406
The fact is, we all have biases
against what's different,

50
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:33,335
what's different to our social norms.

51
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,359
The thing is, if we want
to live in a world

52
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,494
where the circumstances of your birth

53
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,935
do not dictate your future

54
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:44,140
and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,

55
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,697
then each and every one of us
has a role to play

56
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:50,960
in making sure unconscious bias
does not determine our lives.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,909
There's this really famous experiment
in the space of unconscious bias

58
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,637
and that's in the space of gender
in the 1970s and 1980s.

59
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,672
So orchestras, back in the day,
were made up mostly of dudes,

60
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:06,473
up to only five percent were female.

61
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:09,741
And apparently, that was because
men played it differently,

62
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:12,555
presumably better, presumably.

63
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:15,517
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra

64
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,282
started an experiment.

65
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,125
They started blind auditions.

66
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,954
So rather than face-to-face auditions,
you would have to play behind a screen.

67
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,466
Now funnily enough,

68
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,754
no immediate change was registered

69
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:29,890
until they asked the audition-ers
to take their shoes off

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,578
before they entered the room.

71
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,618
because the clickity-clack
of the heels

72
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,559
against the hardwood floors

73
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,828
was enough to give the ladies away.

74
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,334
Now get this,

75
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,196
there results of the audition showed

76
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:44,196
that there was a 50 percent
increased chance

77
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:47,126
a woman would progress past
the preliminary stage.

78
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,580
And it almost tripled
their chances of getting in.

79
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,093
What does that tell us?

80
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:56,929
Well, unfortunately for the guys,
men actually didn't play differently,

81
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,829
but there was the perception
that they did.

82
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,146
And it was that bias that was
determining their outcome.

83
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:06,244
So what we're doing here
is identifying and acknowledging

84
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,292
that a bias exists.

85
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,910
And look, we all do it.

86
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,697
Let me give you an example.

87
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:14,475
A son and his father are in
a horrible car accident.

88
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,339
The father dies on impact

89
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,999
and the son, who's severely injured,
is rushed to hospital.

90
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,381
The surgeon looks at the son
when they arrive and is like,

91
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,788
"I can't operate."

92
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:27,694
Why?

93
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:30,900
"The boy is my son."

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,248
How can that be?

95
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,468
Ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,334
the surgeon is his mother.

97
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,077
Now hands up -- and it's okay --

98
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,837
but hands up if you initially assumed
the surgeon was a guy?

99
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,838
There's evidence that
that unconscious bias exists,

100
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:48,870
but we all just have
to acknowledge that it's there

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,554
and then look at ways
that we can move past it

102
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:54,258
so that we can look at solutions.

103
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:57,075
Now one of the interesting things

104
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,357
around the space of unconscious bias
is the topic of quotas.

105
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,682
And this something
that's often brought up.

106
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,993
And of of the criticisms
is this idea of merit.

107
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:09,165
Look, I don't want to be picked
because I'm a chick,

108
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:11,432
I want to be picked because
I have merit,

109
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,608
because I'm the best person for the job.

110
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,507
It's a sentiment that's pretty common
among female engineers

111
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,413
that I work with and that I know.

112
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:20,314
And yeah, I get it, I've been there.

113
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,653
But, if the merit idea was true,

114
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:27,420
why would identical resumes,
in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,

115
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,014
identical resumes sent out
for a lab technician,

116
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:35,230
why would Jennifers
be deemed less competent,

117
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,494
be less likely to be offered the job,

118
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:41,171
and be paid less than Johns.

119
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,624
The unconscious bias is there,

120
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:46,060
but we just have to look at
how we can move past it.

121
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,681
And, you know, it's interesting,

122
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,494
there's some research that talks about

123
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,346
why this is the case and
it's called the merit paradox.

124
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,867
And in organizations --
and this is kind of ironic --

125
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:58,694
in organizations that talk about merit
being their primary value-driver

126
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,066
in terms of who they hire,

127
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,561
they were more likely to hire dudes
and more likely to pay the guys more

128
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,168
because apparently merit
is a masculine quality.

129
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,430
But, hey.

130
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,744
So you guys think you've got
a good read on me,

131
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:14,175
you kinda think you know what's up.

132
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,748
Can you imagine me running one of these?

133
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:20,035
Can you imagine me walking in
and being like,

134
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:23,140
"Hey boys, this is what's up.
This is how it's done."

135
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, I'm glad you can.

136
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,163
(Applause)

137
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,310
Because ladies and gentlemen,
that's my day job.

138
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,247
And the cool thing about it is
that it's pretty entertaining.

139
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,935
Actually, in places like Malaysia,

140
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,395
Muslim women on rigs
isn't even comment-worthy.

141
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,764
There are that many of them.

142
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:49,992
But, it is entertaining.

143
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,049
I remember, I was telling one of the guys,

144
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,620
"Hey, mate, look, I really want
to learn how to surf."

145
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,181
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't
know how you can surf

146
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,552
with all that gear you've got on,

147
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,226
and I don't know any women-only beaches."

148
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:04,510
And then, the guy came up
with a brilliant idea,

149
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,768
he was like, "I know, you run
that organization

150
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,628
Youth Without Borders, right?

151
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:13,282
Why don't you start a clothing line
for Muslim chicks in beaches.

152
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,919
You can call it
Youth Without Boardshorts."

153
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,435
(Laughter)

154
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:19,250
And I was like, "Thanks, guys."

155
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,356
And I remember another bloke
telling me that

156
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,169
I should eat all the yogurt I could

157
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,387
because that was the only culture
I was going to get around there.

158
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:32,366
But, the problem is, it's kind of true

159
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:35,704
because there's an intense
lack of diversity in our workforce,

160
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,992
particularly in places of influence.

161
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,352
Now, in 2010,

162
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,825
The Australian National University
did an experiment

163
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:45,431
where they sent out
4,000 identical applications

164
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,963
to entry level jobs, essentially.

165
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:53,177
To get the same number of interviews
as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,

166
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:57,674
if you were Chinese, you had
to send out 68 percent more applications.

167
00:07:57,674 --> 00:08:00,368
If you were Middle Eastern --
Abdel-Magied --

168
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:02,418
you had to send out 64 percent,

169
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,581
and if you're Italian,
you're pretty lucky,

170
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,142
you only have to send out 12 percent more.

171
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:10,151
In places like Silicon Valley,
it's not that much better.

172
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,448
In Google, they put out
some diversity results

173
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:19,390
and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian
and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,

174
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,717
all that kind of thing.

175
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,345
And the rest of the tech world
is not that much better

176
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:24,677
and they've acknowledged it,

177
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:27,225
but I'm not really sure
what they're doing about it.

178
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,445
The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.

179
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,203
In a study done by Green Park,

180
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:35,275
who are a British senior exec supplier,

181
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:39,738
they said that over half
of the FTSE 100 companies

182
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:42,138
don't have a nonwhite leader
at their board level,

183
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:43,593
executive or non-executive.

184
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:47,686
And two out of every three
don't have an executive

185
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,956
who's from a minority.

186
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:52,778
And most of the minorities
that are at that sort of level

187
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,420
are non-executive board directors.

188
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,086
So their influence isn't that great.

189
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,301
I've told you a bunch of terrible things.

190
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:02,722
You're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that?
What can I do about it?"

191
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,815
Well, fortunately,

192
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:07,857
we've identified that there's a problem.

193
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:12,793
There's a lack of opportunity,
and that's due to unconscious bias.

194
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,672
But you might be sitting
there thinking,

195
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:19,482
"I ain't brown. What's that got
to do with me?"

196
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,466
Let me offer you a solution.

197
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,717
And as I've said before,

198
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:27,568
we live in a world where
we're looking for an ideal.

199
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,208
And if we want to create a world

200
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,809
where the circumstances
of your birth don't matter,

201
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,838
we all have to be part of the solution.

202
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:36,913
And interestingly, the author
of the lab resume experiment

203
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:38,514
offered some sort of a solution.

204
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:42,248
She said the one thing that brought
the successful women together,

205
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,227
the one thing that they had in common,

206
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:46,694
was the fact that they had good mentors.

207
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:49,139
So mentoring, we've all kind of
heard that before,

208
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,577
it's in the vernacular.

209
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,661
Here's another challenge for you.

210
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,861
I challenge each and every one of you
to mentor someone different.

211
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:00,988
Think about it.

212
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:04,034
Everyone wants to mentor someone
who kind of is familiar,

213
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:04,893
who looks like us,

214
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:06,367
we have shared experiences.

215
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,028
If I see a Muslim chick
who's got a bit of attitude,

216
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,881
I'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."

217
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:14,117
You walk into a room and there's someone
who went to the same school,

218
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,428
you play the same sports,

219
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,982
there's a high chance that you're
going to want to help that person out.

220
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,509
But for the person in the room
who has no shared experiences with you

221
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:25,415
it becomes extremely difficult
to find that connection.

222
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,834
The idea of finding someone
different to mentor,

223
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,505
someone who doesn't come
from the same background as you,

224
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,988
whatever that background is,

225
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:35,336
is about opening doors
for people who couldn't even get

226
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,331
to the damn hallway.

227
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:41,566
Because ladies and gentlemen,
the world is not just.

228
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,699
People are not born
with equal opportunity.

229
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,986
I was born in one of the poorest
cities in the world, Khartoum.

230
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:49,107
I was born brown, I was born female,

231
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,941
and I was born Muslim in a world
that is pretty suspicious of us

232
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,186
for reasons I can't control.

233
00:10:56,186 --> 00:11:00,156
However, I also acknowledge the fact
that I was born with privilege.

234
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:01,825
I was born with amazing parents,

235
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,430
I was given an education

236
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,067
and had the blessing
of migrating to Australia.

237
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,658
But also, I've been blessed
with amazing mentors

238
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:11,674
who've opened doors for me
that I didn't even know were there.

239
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,032
A mentor who said to me,

240
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,635
"Hey, your story's interesting.

241
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,862
Let's write something about it
so that I can share it with people."

242
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:18,868
A mentor who said,

243
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:22,219
"I know you're all those things that don't
belong on an Australian rig,

244
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:23,548
but come on anyway."

245
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,055
And here I am, talking to you.

246
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,393
And I'm not the only one.

247
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,862
There's all sorts of people
in my communities

248
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,026
that I see have been
helped out by mentors.

249
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,805
A young Muslim man in Sydney

250
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,973
who ended up using his mentor's help

251
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,476
to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown

252
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:41,098
and now it's a huge thing.

253
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:44,218
And he's able to change the lives
of so many other young people.

254
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:45,542
Or a lady here in Brisbane,

255
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,400
an Afghan lady who's a refugee,

256
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,151
who could barely speak English
when she came to Australia,

257
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:52,030
her mentors helped her become a doctor

258
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,253
and she took our Young Queenslander
of the Year Award in 2008.

259
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,526
She's an inspiration.

260
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,976
This is so not smooth.

261
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,940
This is me.

262
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,812
But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,

263
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,611
and I'm also the woman who was
in the abaya at the beginning.

264
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,709
Would you have chosen to mentor me
if you had seen me

265
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,962
in one of those other versions
of who I am?

266
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,470
Because I'm that same person.

267
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,014
We have to look past our unconscious bias,

268
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,206
find someone to mentor who's at
the opposite end of your spectrum

269
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,591
because structural change takes time,

270
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,707
and I don't have that level of patience.

271
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:38,468
So if we're going to create a change,

272
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,030
if we're going to create a world

273
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,286
where we all have
those kinds of opportunities,

274
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,657
then choose to open doors for people.

275
00:12:44,657 --> 00:12:48,471
Because you might think that
diversity has nothing to do with you,

276
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:50,205
but we are all part of this system

277
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:52,301
and we can all be part of that solution.

278
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,855
And if you don't know
where to find someone different,

279
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,833
go to the places you wouldn't usually go.

280
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,996
If you enroll in
private high school tutoring,

281
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,463
go to your local state school

282
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:03,893
or maybe just drop into your
local refugee tutoring center.

283
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,616
Or perhaps you work at an office.

284
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,614
Take out that new grad who looks
totally out of place --

285
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:09,942
'cause that was me --

286
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,270
and open doors for them,

287
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,900
not in a tokenistic way,
because we're not victims,

288
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,968
but show them the opportunities

289
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,070
because opening up your world

290
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,741
will make you realize that
you have access to doors

291
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,565
that they didn't even know existed

292
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:25,501
and you didn't even know
they didn't have.

293
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,358
Ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:31,907
there is a problem in our community
with lack of opportunity,

295
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,750
especially due to unconscious bias.

296
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,782
But each and every one one of you
has the potential to change that.

297
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,654
I know you've been given a lot
of challenges today,

298
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,495
but if you can take this one piece
and think about it a little differently,

299
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:47,736
because diversity is magic.

300
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,554
And I encourage you to look past
your initial perceptions

301
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:53,378
because I bet you,

302
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,199
they're probably wrong.

303
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,624
Thank you.

304
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:01,015
(Applause)
