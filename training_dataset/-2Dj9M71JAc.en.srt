00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,971
On the path that American children
travel to adulthood,

1
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:20,519
two institutions oversee the journey.

2
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,262
The first is the one we hear
a lot about: college.

3
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,845
Some of you may remember
the excitement that you felt

4
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,431
when you first set off for college.

5
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:31,983
Some of you may be in college right now

6
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,998
and you're feeling this excitement
at this very moment.

7
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:37,667
College has some shortcomings.

8
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:41,003
It's expensive; it leaves
young people in debt.

9
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,947
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.

10
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:49,114
Young people emerge from college
with pride and with great friends

11
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:51,453
and with a lot of knowledge
about the world.

12
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,289
And perhaps most importantly,

13
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,795
a better chance in the labor market
than they had before they got there.

14
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,498
Today I want to talk about
the second institution

15
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:06,056
overseeing the journey from childhood
to adulthood in the United States.

16
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:09,811
And that institution is prison.

17
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,536
Young people on this journey
are meeting with probation officers

18
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:16,939
instead of with teachers.

19
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,832
They're going to court dates
instead of to class.

20
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:25,909
Their junior year abroad is instead
a trip to a state correctional facility.

21
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,599
And they're emerging from their 20s

22
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,796
not with degrees in business and English,

23
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,814
but with criminal records.

24
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:37,107
This institution is also costing us a lot,

25
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:38,749
about 40,000 dollars a year

26
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:42,517
to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey.

27
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,723
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

28
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:49,206
and what kids are getting
is a cold prison cell

29
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:52,016
and a permanent mark against them
when they come home

30
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,765
and apply for work.

31
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:58,211
There are more and more kids
on this journey to adulthood

32
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:03,435
than ever before in the United States
and that's because in the past 40 years,

33
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:09,187
our incarceration rate
has grown by 700 percent.

34
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,316
I have one slide for this talk.

35
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:12,570
Here it is.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,623
Here's our incarceration rate,

37
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:21,915
about 716 people per 100,000
in the population.

38
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,065
Here's the OECD countries.

39
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,617
What's more, it's poor kids
that we're sending to prison,

40
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:37,105
too many drawn from African-American
and Latino communities

41
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:41,986
so that prison now stands firmly between
the young people trying to make it

42
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:45,418
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

43
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:48,274
The problem's actually
a bit worse than this

44
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:50,952
'cause we're not just sending
poor kids to prison,

45
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,919
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

46
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,240
with probation and parole restrictions,

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,127
with low-level warrants,

48
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,622
we're asking them to live
in halfway houses and on house arrest,

49
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:05,227
and we're asking them
to negotiate a police force

50
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,640
that is entering poor
communities of color,

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,839
not for the purposes
of promoting public safety,

52
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:15,315
but to make arrest counts,
to line city coffers.

53
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:22,925
This is the hidden underside to our
historic experiment in punishment:

54
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:27,971
young people worried that at any moment,
they will be stopped, searched and seized.

55
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:31,258
Not just in the streets,
but in their homes,

56
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,695
at school and at work.

57
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:38,116
I got interested in this
other path to adulthood

58
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:40,357
when I was myself a college student

59
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:42,415
attending the University of Pennsylvania

60
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,493
in the early 2000s.

61
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:48,060
Penn sits within a historic
African-American neighborhood.

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,298
So you've got these two parallel
journeys going on simultaneously:

63
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,419
the kids attending
this elite, private university,

64
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,885
and the kids from
the adjacent neighborhood,

65
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,813
some of whom are making it to college,

66
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:04,311
and many of whom
are being shipped to prison.

67
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:09,415
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
a young woman who was in high school

68
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,409
who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university.

69
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,942
Soon, her cousin came home
from a juvenile detention center.

70
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,600
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,259
I began to get to know him
and his friends and family,

72
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,611
and I asked him what he thought
about me writing about his life

73
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:28,196
for my senior thesis in college.

74
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:32,387
This senior thesis became
a dissertation at Princeton

75
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:33,935
and now a book.

76
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,533
By the end of my sophomore year,

77
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,903
I moved into the neighborhood
and I spent the next six years

78
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:43,494
trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age.

79
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,318
The first week I spent
in this neighborhood,

80
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,894
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

81
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,386
play this game of chase,

82
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:53,337
where the older boy
ran after the other boy.

83
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:54,532
He played the cop.

84
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,720
When the cop caught up
to the younger boy,

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,420
he pushed him down,

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,971
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

87
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,282
took a quarter out of
the other child's pocket,

88
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:06,874
saying, "I'm seizing that."

89
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,214
He asked the child if
he was carrying any drugs

90
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,659
or if he had a warrant.

91
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,664
Many times, I saw this game repeated,

92
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,052
sometimes children would
simply give up running,

93
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,248
and stick their bodies flat
against the ground

94
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:22,593
with their hands above their heads,
or flat up against a wall.

95
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,588
Children would yell at each other,

96
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:25,870
"I'm going to lock you up,

97
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,052
I'm going to lock you up
and you're never coming home!"

98
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:33,406
Once I saw a six-year-old child
pull another child's pants down

99
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,816
and try to do a cavity search.

100
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,935
In the first 18 months that I lived
in this neighborhood,

101
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:43,627
I wrote down every time I saw
any contact between police

102
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:46,173
and people that were my neighbors.

103
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,652
So in the first 18 months,

104
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:52,421
I watched the police stop
pedestrians or people in cars,

105
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,589
search people, run people's names,

106
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,533
chase people through the streets,

107
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,306
pull people in for questioning,

108
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:02,489
or make an arrest every single day,
with five exceptions.

109
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:07,077
Fifty-two times, I watched the police
break down doors,

110
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,118
chase people through houses

111
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,337
or make an arrest of someone
in their home.

112
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,150
Fourteen times
in this first year and a half,

113
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,450
I watched the police punch, choke,
kick, stomp on or beat young men

114
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,269
after they had caught them.

115
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,665
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

116
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:28,209
Chuck and Tim.

117
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,250
Chuck was 18 when we met,
a senior in high school.

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,798
He was playing on the basketball team
and making C's and B's.

119
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,697
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

120
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,848
And Tim loved Chuck;
he followed him around a lot,

121
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,139
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.

122
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,285
They lived with their mom and grandfather

123
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:47,724
in a two-story row home
with a front lawn and a back porch.

124
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:51,385
Their mom was struggling with addiction
all while the boys were growing up.

125
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:55,233
She never really was able
to hold down a job for very long.

126
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:58,281
It was their grandfather's pension
that supported the family,

127
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:01,484
not really enough to pay
for food and clothes

128
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:04,215
and school supplies for growing boys.

129
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,401
The family was really struggling.

130
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,780
So when we met, Chuck was
a senior in high school.

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,898
He had just turned 18.

132
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:14,770
That winter, a kid in the schoolyard

133
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,029
called Chuck's mom a crack whore.

134
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,904
Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow

135
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:24,729
and the school cops charged him
with aggravated assault.

136
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,479
The other kid was fine the next day,

137
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,952
I think it was his pride that was injured
more than anything.

138
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,665
But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

139
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,853
this agg. assault case sent him
to adult county jail

140
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,278
on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,

141
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:41,345
where he sat, unable to pay the bail --
he couldn't afford it --

142
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:44,544
while the trial dates
dragged on and on and on

143
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,266
through almost his entire senior year.

144
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,976
Finally, near the end of this season,

145
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:54,323
the judge on this assault case
threw out most of the charges

146
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:55,657
and Chuck came home

147
00:07:55,657 --> 00:08:00,004
with only a few hundred dollars' worth
of court fees hanging over his head.

148
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:02,547
Tim was pretty happy that day.

149
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,301
The next fall, Chuck tried
to re-enroll as a senior,

150
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,315
but the school secretary told him that

151
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:10,446
he was then 19 and too old
to be readmitted.

152
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:14,113
Then the judge on his assault case
issued him a warrant for his arrest

153
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:17,388
because he couldn't pay
the 225 dollars in court fees

154
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,915
that came due a few weeks after
the case ended.

155
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:24,935
Then he was a high school dropout
living on the run.

156
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,987
Tim's first arrest came later that year

157
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,770
after he turned 11.

158
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,900
Chuck had managed
to get his warrant lifted

159
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,561
and he was on a payment plan
for the court fees

160
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,071
and he was driving Tim to school
in his girlfriend's car.

161
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,806
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

162
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:43,591
and the car comes up
as stolen in California.

163
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,714
Chuck had no idea where in the history
of this car it had been stolen.

164
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:51,190
His girlfriend's uncle bought it
from a used car auction

165
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,657
in northeast Philly.

166
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,485
Chuck and Tim had never been
outside of the tri-state,

167
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,834
let alone to California.

168
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,932
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

169
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:03,500
charged Chuck with
receiving stolen property.

170
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,312
And then a juvenile judge,
a few days later,

171
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,464
charged Tim, age 11,

172
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,537
with accessory to receiving
a stolen property

173
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:15,190
and then he was placed on
three years of probation.

174
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,332
With this probation sentence
hanging over his head,

175
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,419
Chuck sat his little brother down

176
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,868
and began teaching him
how to run from the police.

177
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,200
They would sit side by side
on their back porch

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,264
looking out into the shared alleyway

179
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:33,104
and Chuck would coach Tim
how to spot undercover cars,

180
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:38,071
how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
how and where to hide.

181
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,691
I want you to imagine for a second

182
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:43,060
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

183
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,809
if they were living in a neighborhood
where kids were going to college,

184
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,238
not prison.

185
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:53,071
A neighborhood like the one
I got to grow up in.

186
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:54,536
Okay, you might say.

187
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:58,288
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
they're committing crimes!

188
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:00,414
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

189
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:04,228
Don't they deserve to be
living in fear of arrest?

190
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,350
Well, my answer would be no.

191
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,430
They don't.

192
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,457
And certainly not for the same things
that other young people

193
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:14,901
with more privilege are doing
with impunity.

194
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,718
If Chuck had gone to my high school,

195
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,041
that schoolyard fight
would have ended there,

196
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,717
as a schoolyard fight.

197
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:24,267
It never would have become
an aggravated assault case.

198
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,758
Not a single kid that
I went to college with

199
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,437
has a criminal record right now.

200
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:31,311
Not a single one.

201
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:35,316
But can you imagine how many might have
if the police had stopped those kids

202
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:39,183
and searched their pockets for drugs
as they walked to class?

203
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:43,244
Or had raided their frat parties
in the middle of the night?

204
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:45,656
Okay, you might say.

205
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:47,646
But doesn't this high incarceration rate

206
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,399
partly account for our
really low crime rate?

207
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,823
Crime is down. That's a good thing.

208
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,310
Totally, that is a good thing.
Crime is down.

209
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,837
It dropped precipitously in
the '90s and through the 2000s.

210
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:00,882
But according to a committee of academics

211
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:04,536
convened by the National Academy
of Sciences last year,

212
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:08,545
the relationship between our
historically high incarceration rates

213
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:12,129
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

214
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,569
It turns out that the crime rate
goes up and down

215
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:20,095
irrespective of how many young people
we send to prison.

216
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,358
We tend to think about justice
in a pretty narrow way:

217
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:27,962
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

218
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:31,317
Injustice is about being
wrongfully convicted.

219
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,632
So if you're convicted
of something you did do,

220
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,467
you should be punished for it.

221
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,233
There are innocent and guilty people,

222
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,670
there are victims and
there are perpetrators.

223
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,071
Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that.

224
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:48,505
Right now, we're asking kids who live
in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

225
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,786
who have the least amount
of family resources,

226
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:53,347
who are attending
the country's worst schools,

227
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,253
who are facing the toughest time
in the labor market,

228
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:59,906
who are living in neighborhoods
where violence is an everyday problem,

229
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:04,479
we're asking these kids to walk
the thinnest possible line --

230
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,290
to basically never do anything wrong.

231
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,791
Why are we not providing support
to young kids facing these challenges?

232
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:20,037
Why are we offering only handcuffs,
jail time and this fugitive existence?

233
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,543
Can we imagine something better?

234
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:26,798
Can we imagine a criminal justice system
that prioritizes recovery,

235
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,385
prevention, civic inclusion,

236
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,086
rather than punishment?

237
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,475
(Applause)

238
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,130
A criminal justice system
that acknowledges

239
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,110
the legacy of exclusion that poor people
of color in the U.S. have faced

240
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,266
and that does not promote
and perpetuate those exclusions.

241
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,651
(Applause)

242
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,853
And finally, a criminal justice system
that believes in black young people,

243
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,717
rather than treating black young people
as the enemy to be rounded up.

244
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,440
(Applause)

245
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,287
The good news is that we already are.

246
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:19,110
A few years ago, Michelle Alexander
wrote "The New Jim Crow,"

247
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,123
which got Americans to see
incarceration as a civil rights issue

248
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:27,479
of historic proportions in a way
they had not seen it before.

249
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:31,238
President Obama and Attorney General
Eric Holder have come out very strongly

250
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,955
on sentencing reform,

251
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:36,699
on the need to address
racial disparity in incarceration.

252
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,309
We're seeing states throw out
Stop and Frisk

253
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,345
as the civil rights violation that it is.

254
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:47,400
We're seeing cities and states
decriminalize possession of marijuana.

255
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,257
New York, New Jersey
and California

256
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:53,094
have been dropping their
prison populations, closing prisons,

257
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,375
while also seeing a big drop in crime.

258
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,068
Texas has gotten into the game now,

259
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:00,913
also closing prisons,
investing in education.

260
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:04,570
This curious coalition is building
from the right and the left,

261
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,018
made up of former prisoners
and fiscal conservatives,

262
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:11,349
of civil rights activists
and libertarians,

263
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:15,329
of young people taking to the streets
to protest police violence

264
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,165
against unarmed black teenagers,

265
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:20,211
and older, wealthier people --

266
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:22,082
some of you are here in the audience --

267
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:26,017
pumping big money into
decarceration initiatives

268
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:29,107
In a deeply divided Congress,

269
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,810
the work of reforming
our criminal justice system

270
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,602
is just about the only thing
that the right and the left

271
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,187
are coming together on.

272
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:41,101
I did not think I would see
this political moment in my lifetime.

273
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:44,710
I think many of the people
who have been working tirelessly

274
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,872
to write about the causes and consequences

275
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:49,104
of our historically
high incarceration rates

276
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,870
did not think we would see
this moment in our lifetime.

277
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,653
The question for us now is,
how much can we make of it?

278
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:59,618
How much can we change?

279
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,182
I want to end with a call to young people,

280
00:15:02,182 --> 00:15:03,816
the young people attending college

281
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,926
and the young people
struggling to stay out of prison

282
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:10,030
or to make it through prison
and return home.

283
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,063
It may seem like these paths
to adulthood are worlds apart,

284
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:18,505
but the young people participating
in these two institutions

285
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,430
conveying us to adulthood,

286
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,995
they have one thing in common:

287
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:27,677
Both can be leaders in the work
of reforming our criminal justice system.

288
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,815
Young people have always been leaders
in the fight for equal rights,

289
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,080
the fight for more people
to be granted dignity

290
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,635
and a fighting chance at freedom.

291
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,014
The mission for the generation
of young people

292
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:43,994
coming of age in this, a sea-change
moment, potentially,

293
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:49,258
is to end mass incarceration and
build a new criminal justice system,

294
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:52,185
emphasis on the word justice.

295
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,589
Thanks.

296
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,168
(Applause)
