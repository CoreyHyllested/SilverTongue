0
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:18,904
Do I look real to you?

1
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,341
Hope so.

2
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,600
I have no idea if you're seeing this,

3
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:27,043
but I'm just going to look ahead
and trust that you're there.

4
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:30,566
I've drawn a semicircle
in the sand in front of me

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,945
so I don't walk past it
and look like I'm floating in midair.

6
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,061
Right now I'm standing

7
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,283
in the open air,

8
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,172
on a beach under a palm tree,

9
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,615
in the exact spot
where your stage used to be.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,734
I have 12 minutes with you.

11
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,043
I set a limit.

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,005
My wife Navid once said

13
00:00:56,029 --> 00:01:00,030
that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy.

14
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,510
For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something

15
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:06,887
that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo.

16
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:09,943
But we only had three days to make it,

17
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,671
and the only fabric we had

18
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:14,416
was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,915
But she did it, and it's perfect.

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,677
And she looked at it and said,

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,334
"Proof of concept --
creation needs constraint."

22
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,168
So with these 12 minutes,

23
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:33,843
I'm going to tell you
about my greatest discovery.

24
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:40,256
For my whole life, my obsession
has been eternal life,

25
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,391
as I know it is so many of yours.

26
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:48,787
You may be happy to know
that your research will pay off.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,398
I am 318 years old.

28
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:57,257
The average human lifespan
is now 432 years,

29
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,561
and my work has been to extend
the human lifespan indefinitely.

30
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:03,850
And I've never questioned that someday,

31
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,816
we'll reach a point
where we'll be content.

32
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,565
But the opposite keeps happening:

33
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,063
the longer we live,
the longer we want to live,

34
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,715
the less we want to die.

35
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,310
Who can blame us?

36
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:21,441
The universe is so big.

37
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,454
There won't ever not be more to see.

38
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,629
Just yesterday,

39
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,413
I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa

40
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,851
and sail from island to island
all over the planet,

41
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,108
and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit

42
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:36,921
and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.

43
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:40,992
And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter

44
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,493
who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.

45
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,857
And then there are others
where there's no one

46
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,862
and there never has been,

47
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:51,711
and so you go just for the pleasure
of touching your foot to sand

48
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,917
that no foot has ever touched before.

49
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,870
You could spend 400 years doing just that.

50
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,044
Right now the Moon is rising
in the Northeast.

51
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:09,164
I can see the cities on it
with my naked eye.

52
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,300
They're connected like nerve clusters:

53
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:17,825
Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator.

54
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:21,962
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.

55
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,448
That's where Navid and I met.

56
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,457
We were both artists downtown.

57
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,994
The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square,

58
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,480
and we bumped shoulders.

59
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:36,255
And I turned to apologize

60
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:40,578
and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything,

61
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:44,140
said, "Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"

62
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,339
And first of all, I thought,
"Who the hell are you?"

63
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,385
But second, the question annoyed me,

64
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,201
because the answer is so simple.

65
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,308
I said, "We didn't pass through each other

66
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,576
because elementary particles have mass

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,973
and because the space
between elementary particles

68
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:05,369
is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass,

69
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,573
and we've known that for 800 years."

70
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,875
She must have been in one of those moods

71
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,787
where she likes to mess with strangers.

72
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,700
Or maybe she was just flirting with me,

73
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,095
because she looked at me and said,
"I thought you'd say that.

74
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,787
Think deeper."

75
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,334
And then she took off her belt,

76
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:26,861
this belt that I'm wearing now,

77
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,583
and she said,

78
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:36,372
"Our universe is built
so that particles have mass.

79
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,270
Without that basic constraint,

80
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,777
we'd have just passed right through
each other at the speed of light

81
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,271
and never even known."

82
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,375
And that's how our romance began.

83
00:04:58,128 --> 00:04:59,588
Navid and I

84
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,731
never ran out of things to talk about.

85
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,476
Never.

86
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,252
It was incredible.

87
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:12,810
It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together

88
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,289
and we kept arriving at new vistas,

89
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:18,309
and these new, perfect
constellations of words

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,190
would come out of us to describe them.

91
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:22,338
And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them,

92
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:25,783
and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up.

93
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:29,721
Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread,

94
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:33,264
and that we were always
adding in a little more flour

95
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,737
and a little more water,

96
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,714
and folding it in and turning it over

97
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:40,412
and never getting around to baking it.

98
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:48,018
If my obsession was eternal life,
Navid's obsession was touch.

99
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:52,788
She had a genius for it.

100
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,439
All of her work revolved around it.

101
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,589
My body was like a canvas for her,

102
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:04,234
and she would draw her fingertip
down over my face so slowly

103
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:06,241
that I couldn't feel it moving.

104
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,938
And she was obsessed with the exact moment

105
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:12,840
when I would stop being able to tell
the difference between her body and mine.

106
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,716
Or she would just lie across me
and dig her shoulder into mine

107
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,631
and say, "Pilar, why does
this feel so good?"

108
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,592
I'd say, "I don't know!"

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,626
And she always had a facetious answer
for her facetious question,

110
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,597
but the answer I remember today is,

111
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,550
"It feels good

112
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,354
because the universe chose
its constraints,

113
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:42,663
and we are its art."

114
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:56,702
It's always funny what you think
the future is going to be like

115
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,296
versus what it turns out to be.

116
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,273
In your time, scientists thought
humans could freeze themselves

117
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,629
and wake up in the future.

118
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,471
And they did -- but then they died.

119
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,843
In your time, scientists thought
humans could replace organs

120
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,120
and extend life for hundreds of years.

121
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,657
And they did,

122
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,683
but eventually, they died anyway.

123
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:26,771
In your time, Earth
is the only place people live.

124
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,211
In my time, Earth is the place
people come to die.

125
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,059
So when Navid started to show the signs,

126
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,515
our friends assumed I would do
what everyone does,

127
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,674
which is say goodbye
and send her to Earth,

128
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,732
so that none of us
would have to look at her

129
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:53,492
or be around her
or think about her and her ...

130
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,858
failure to keep living.

131
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:01,995
More than anything,

132
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,796
they didn't want to be around
her actual physical body.

133
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,824
They kept referring to it as "declining,"

134
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,801
even though she herself
was fascinated by it,

135
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,948
the changes it was going through,

136
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:16,845
following the rules of its nature
day by day, independent of her will.

137
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,051
I did send Navid to Earth.

138
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:25,355
But I came with her.

139
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,509
I remember a friend of ours,
just before we left, said,

140
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,739
"I just think it's arrogant,

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,953
like the rules don't apply to you,
like you think your love is that special."

142
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,720
But I did.

143
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,858
So, even here on Earth,

144
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:48,579
I kept working on how to extend life.

145
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,349
It didn't occur to me

146
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,416
that there could be any other response.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,979
I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me

148
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,742
that day in Azadi Square,

149
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,707
that without that basic constraint --

150
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:01,762
a universe that granted mass to matter --

151
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,183
we would not exist.

152
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:06,652
That's one rule.

153
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:10,564
Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy.

154
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,700
And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass.

155
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,406
I know. I tried everything.

156
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,569
I tried creating a photon box
where the Higgs field was altered.

157
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:25,175
I tried recording all
subatomic movements in my body

158
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,986
and replaying them on closed loop.

159
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,191
Nothing worked.

160
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:38,944
But my final innovation
was to create a coil dimension

161
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:43,299
with the boundaries of a body
in which time moved infinitely slower,

162
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,718
but whose projection would appear
to move in normal time.

163
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,059
That body would then appear
in our universe as a hologram --

164
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,604
here but not here.

165
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,521
When I realized I'd done it,

166
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,843
I ran to her room,

167
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,061
so happy to tell her I'd done it,

168
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:11,696
moving through space
almost normally to all eyes,

169
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,704
even to my own,

170
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,585
and went to lie down next to her,

171
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,594
and forgot, and fell right through her.

172
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:30,488
I'd found a way to eternal life,

173
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,758
at the expense of the one thing
Navid loved most,

174
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:38,128
which was to touch and be touched.

175
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,286
And she threw me out.

176
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,412
I still got to watch, though.

177
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,480
Humans live 400 years now,

178
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,882
and we still die.

179
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,114
And when death comes,

180
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:01,597
the dying still pick at their bedsheets,

181
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,130
and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides,

182
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:11,668
and their breaths get further
and further apart,

183
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,341
like they're falling asleep.

184
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,034
I've always thought that

185
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,890
what gives a life meaning is adventure.

186
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:29,869
And death is just a problem

187
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,361
we haven't discovered the solution to yet.

188
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,297
But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends.

189
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,544
Maybe that's the paradox:

190
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,419
constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom.

191
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:52,435
(Sighs)

192
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,987
There was a thunderstorm
here this morning.

193
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,844
There is another forecast for tonight,

194
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,637
but for now the sky is clear.

195
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,290
I can't feel the wind here,

196
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:09,678
but I just asked one of the caretakers
who passed by what it felt like,

197
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:12,845
and she said it felt warm,
like melted butter.

198
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,175
An answer worthy of my wife.

199
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:25,226
I have to find my way back to the flesh.

200
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,195
Until then, I take up no space
but the space you give me.
