0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:14,913
I wanted to just start
by asking everyone a question:

2
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,183
How many of you are completely comfortable

3
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:18,961
with calling yourselves a leader?

4
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:22,558
I've asked that question
all across the country,

5
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:24,559
and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,116
there's a huge portion of the audience
that won't put up their hand.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,636
And I've come to realize
that we have made leadership

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,070
into something bigger than us;
something beyond us.

9
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:34,967
We've made it about changing the world.

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,626
We've taken this title of "leader"

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,578
and treat it as something
that one day we're going to deserve.

12
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,389
But to give it to ourselves right now

13
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,848
means a level of arrogance or cockiness
that we're not comfortable with.

14
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:47,395
And I worry sometimes
that we spend so much time

15
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:50,252
celebrating amazing things
that hardly anybody can do,

16
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:53,826
that we've convinced ourselves those
are the only things worth celebrating.

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,257
We start to devalue the things
we can do every day,

18
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,437
We take moments
where we truly are a leader

19
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:01,968
and we don't let ourselves take credit
for it, or feel good about it.

20
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,093
I've been lucky enough
over the last 10 years

21
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:07,148
to work with amazing people
who've helped me redefine leadership

22
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,196
in a way that I think has made me happier.

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,434
With my short time today,

24
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:14,129
I want to share with you the one story
that is probably most responsible

25
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,316
for that redefinition.

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,309
I went to a little school

27
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,147
called Mount Allison University
in Sackville, New Brunswick.

28
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,830
And on my last day there,
a girl came up to me and said,

29
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:24,996
"I remember the first time I met you."

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,146
And she told me a story
that had happened four years earlier.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,505
She said, "On the day
before I started university,

32
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:32,593
I was in the hotel room
with my mom and dad,

33
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:35,487
and I was so scared
and so convinced that I couldn't do this,

34
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,571
that I wasn't ready for university,
that I just burst into tears.

35
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:39,936
My mom and dad were amazing.

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,122
They were like, "We know you're scared,
but let's just go tomorrow,

37
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:46,631
go to the first day, and if at any point
you feel as if you can't do this,

38
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,814
that's fine; tell us,
and we'll take you home.

39
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,235
We love you no matter what.'"

40
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,886
She says, "So I went the next day.

41
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,394
I was in line for registration,

42
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:56,722
and I looked around and just knew
I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.

43
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:57,897
I knew I had to quit.

44
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,072
I made that decision
and as soon as I made it,

45
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,168
an incredible feeling
of peace came over me.

46
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:05,270
I turned to my mom and dad
to tell them we needed to go home,

47
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:08,207
and at that moment, you came
out of the student union building

48
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,722
wearing the stupidest hat
I've ever seen in my life."

49
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,747
(Laughter)

50
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,022
"It was awesome.

51
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,251
And you had a big sign
promoting Shinerama," --

52
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,304
which is Students Fighting
Cystic Fibrosis,

53
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:19,193
a charity I've worked with for years --

54
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:21,037
"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.

55
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,564
You were handing the lollipops out
to people in line,

56
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:24,931
and talking about Shinerama.

57
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:28,097
All of the sudden, you got to me,
and you just stopped.

58
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,262
And you stared. It was creepy."

59
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:31,737
(Laughter)

60
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,692
This girl knows what I'm talking about.

61
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:34,718
(Laughter)

62
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:38,374
"Then you looked at the guy next to me,
smiled, reached into your bucket,

63
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,854
pulled out a lollipop,
held it out to him and said,

64
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,020
'You need to give a lollipop
to the beautiful woman next to you.'"

65
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:47,984
She said, "I've never seen anyone
get more embarrassed faster in my life.

66
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,258
He turned beet red,
he wouldn't even look at me.

67
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:52,627
He just kind of held
the lollipop out like this."

68
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,952
(Laughter)

69
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:56,549
"I felt so bad for this dude
that I took the lollipop.

70
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:59,764
As soon as I did, you got
this incredibly severe look on your face,

71
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:03,072
looked at my mom and dad
and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!

72
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,494
First day away from home,

73
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,025
and already she's taking candy
from a stranger?'"

74
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,192
(Laughter)

75
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,617
She said, "Everybody lost it.

76
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,324
Twenty feet in every direction,
everyone started to howl.

77
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:16,463
I know this is cheesy, and I don't know
why I'm telling you this,

78
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,909
but in that moment when everyone
was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.

79
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,765
I knew I was where I was supposed
to be; I knew I was home.

80
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:26,122
And I haven't spoken to you
once in the four years since that day.

81
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:29,228
But I heard that you were leaving,
and I had to come and tell you

82
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,829
you've been an incredibly
important person in my life.

83
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,652
I'm going to miss you. Good luck."

84
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:35,726
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.

85
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,331
She gets six feet away,
turns around, smiles and goes,

86
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:40,098
"You should probably know this, too:

87
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm still dating that guy,
four years later."

88
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,474
(Laughter)

89
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,980
A year and a half
after I moved to Toronto,

90
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,881
I got an invitation to their wedding.

91
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:48,912
(Laughter)

92
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,468
Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,845
I have no recollection of that moment.

94
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,315
I've searched my memory banks,

95
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:58,510
because that is funny and I should
remember doing it and I don't.

96
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:01,317
That was such an eye-opening,
transformative moment for me,

97
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,634
to think that maybe the biggest impact
I'd ever had on anyone's life,

98
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:08,147
a moment that had a woman walk up
to a stranger four years later and say,

99
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,327
"You've been an important
person in my life,"

100
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,377
was a moment that I didn't even remember.

101
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,460
How many of you guys
have a lollipop moment,

102
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,554
a moment where someone
said or did something

103
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,066
that you feel fundamentally
made your life better?

104
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,027
All right. How many of you have told
that person they did it?

105
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:23,644
See, why not?

106
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:24,819
We celebrate birthdays,

107
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,514
where all you have to do
is not die for 365 days --

108
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:28,695
(Laughter)

109
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:31,008
Yet we let people
who have made our lives better

110
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,516
walk around without knowing it.

111
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,055
Every single one of you
has been the catalyst

112
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,230
for a lollipop moment.

113
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,271
You've made someone's life better
by something you said or did.

114
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,490
If you think you haven't,

115
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,046
think of all the hands
that didn't go up when I asked.

116
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,459
You're just one of the people
who hasn't been told.

117
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,819
It's scary to think of ourselves
as that powerful,

118
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,731
frightening to think we can matter
that much to other people.

119
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,422
As long as we make leadership
something bigger than us,

120
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:55,362
as long as we keep leadership beyond us

121
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:57,158
and make it about changing the world,

122
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,769
we give ourselves an excuse
not to expect it every day,

123
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:01,702
from ourselves and from each other.

124
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:05,309
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest
fear is not that we are inadequate.

125
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,400
[It] is that we are powerful
beyond measure.

126
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,077
It is our light and not our darkness
that frightens us."

127
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,293
My call to action today
is that we need to get over our fear

128
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:16,319
of how extraordinarily powerful
we can be in each other's lives.

129
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,597
We need to get over it
so we can move beyond it,

130
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,391
and our little brothers and sisters
and one day our kids --

131
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:23,898
or our kids right now --
can watch and start to value

132
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,072
the impact we can have
on each other's lives,

133
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,682
more than money and power
and titles and influence.

134
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,848
We need to redefine leadership
as being about lollipop moments --

135
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:34,402
how many of them we create,
how many we acknowledge,

136
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,613
how many of them we pay forward
and how many we say thank you for.

137
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,257
Because we've made leadership
about changing the world,

138
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,441
and there is no world.

139
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:43,624
There's only six billion
understandings of it.

140
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,063
And if you change
one person's understanding of it,

141
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,116
understanding of what they're capable of,

142
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,449
understanding of how much
people care about them,

143
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,075
understanding of how powerful
an agent for change

144
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,473
they can be in this world,

145
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:55,992
you've changed the whole thing.

146
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,539
And if we can understand
leadership like that,

147
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:01,074
I think if we can redefine
leadership like that,

148
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:02,947
I think we can change everything.

149
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,741
And it's a simple idea,
but I don't think it's a small one.

150
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,937
I want to thank you so much
for letting me share it with you today.
