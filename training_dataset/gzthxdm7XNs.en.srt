0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:16,315
Something happened in the early morning hours

2
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,900
of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,206
on the way our society operates.

4
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:25,484
Ironically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.

5
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,144
The change was silent, imperceptible,

6
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:30,989
unless you knew exactly what to look for.

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,340
On that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,612
ordered that a special switch be thrown

9
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:39,045
in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.

10
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:42,909
Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,471
around the globe went from errors the size of a football field

12
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:51,406
to errors the size of a small room.

13
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:58,105
It's hard to overstate the effect that this change

14
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:00,657
in accuracy has had on us.

15
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,904
Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have

16
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:05,163
in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn

17
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:07,755
directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you

18
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:10,449
what block you were on, let alone what street.

19
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,697
For geolocation, accuracy matters,

20
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:16,955
and things have only improved over the last 10 years.

21
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:19,074
With more base stations, more ground stations,

22
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,043
better receivers and better algorithms,

23
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:25,106
GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,

24
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:29,608
but what part of the street.

25
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:31,854
This level of accuracy

26
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,780
has unleashed a firestorm of innovation.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,451
In fact, many of you navigated here today

28
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:41,044
with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.

29
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:44,269
Paper maps are becoming obsolete.

30
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:48,408
But we now stand on the verge of another revolution

31
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,403
in geolocation accuracy.

32
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,136
What if I told you that the two-meter positioning

33
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:56,567
that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us

34
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:00,464
is pathetic compared to what we could be getting?

35
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:03,297
For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention

36
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,832
to the carrier phase of the GPS signal,

37
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:08,313
and if you have an Internet connection,

38
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:11,129
then you can go from meter level to centimeter level,

39
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,096
even millimeter-level positioning.

40
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:17,376
So why don't we have this capability on our phones?

41
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:21,746
Only, I believe, for a lack of imagination.

42
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:24,913
Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique

43
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,019
into their cheap GPS chips

44
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:29,173
because they're not sure what the general public would do

45
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,749
with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint

46
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:36,587
the wrinkles in the palm of your hand.

47
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,974
But you and I and other innovators,

48
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:43,014
we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.

49
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:45,726
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app

50
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:49,263
that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision

51
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,271
on top of the physical world.

52
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,158
I could build for you a structure up here in 3D,

53
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,526
millimeter accurate, that only you could see,

54
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,419
or my friends at home.

55
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:03,934
So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,

56
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,858
and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,

57
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:12,841
that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning

58
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:16,065
will become cheap and ubiquitous,

59
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,610
and the consequences will be fantastic.

60
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,266
The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.

61
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,946
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"

62
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:29,394
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,

63
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:32,771
which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device

64
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,832
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,

65
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,738
but we know that in the world of nonfiction,

66
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,602
the GPS dot is impossible, right?

67
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:44,226
For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,

68
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,410
and for another, they don't make devices quite this small,

69
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,738
especially when those devices have to relay

70
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:52,713
their measurements back over a network.

71
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,051
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable

72
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:58,065
a few years ago, but things have changed.

73
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:00,921
There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,

74
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,640
better sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,344
a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box

76
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:09,520
to the left of the keys.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,171
Compare that with the device released just months ago

78
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,963
that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,

79
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,516
and if you take a look at the state of the art

80
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:21,262
for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter

81
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,349
on a side and more sensitive than ever,

82
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,858
you realize that the GPS dot will soon move

83
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:31,257
from fiction to nonfiction.

84
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:35,499
Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.

85
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,405
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys

86
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:42,976
anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.

87
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,757
You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on

88
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:50,724
everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.

89
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,196
I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,

90
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:56,564
and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.

91
00:04:56,564 --> 00:05:00,356
But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.

92
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,967
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.

93
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,106
(Laughter)

94
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,614
Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail,

95
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,492
remember how refreshing it was to go from

96
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:15,636
organizing all of your email to simply searching it.

97
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:20,138
The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.

98
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:24,824
Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.

99
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,213
I was in my office some months back

100
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,756
and got a telephone call.

101
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:33,377
The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,

102
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,456
was panicked.

103
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:38,249
Apparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California

104
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:41,564
had found her in Texas and was following her around.

105
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:45,401
So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.

106
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,800
Well, so did I.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,791
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.

108
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,525
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up,

109
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:57,875
at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,

110
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,571
he was carrying an open laptop,

111
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,414
and over time Carol realized that he had planted

112
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,962
a GPS tracking device on her car,

113
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:08,871
so she was calling me for help to disable it.

114
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,859
"Well, you should go to a good mechanic

115
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:14,143
and have him look at your car," I said.

116
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:16,847
"I already have," she told me.

117
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,991
"He didn't see anything obvious,

118
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:22,528
and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."

119
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:25,849
"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.

120
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,953
"I already have," she replied.

121
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,399
"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,

122
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,152
and they're not set up technically to find the device."

123
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,658
"Okay, what about the FBI?"

124
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:40,821
"I've talked to them too, and same story."

125
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,491
We then talked about her coming to my lab

126
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:45,039
and us performing a radio sweep of her car,

127
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,538
but I wasn't even sure that would work,

128
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,589
given that some of these devices are configured

129
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,823
to only transmit when they're inside safe zones

130
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:55,127
or when the car is moving.

131
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,621
So, there we were.

132
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,590
Carol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,

133
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,525
to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,

134
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:10,410
worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.

135
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,213
In fact, as I looked into her case,

136
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:15,675
I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal

137
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:20,108
for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.

138
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,988
The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman

139
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:28,320
has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,

140
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,836
but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,

141
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:34,466
so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,

142
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,737
but Big Neighbor. (Laughter)

143
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:42,385
There is one alternative that Carol could have taken,

144
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:48,088
very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.

145
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,023
It's an open-source GPS jammer,

146
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,578
developed by Limor Fried,

147
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:57,371
a graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it

148
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:01,256
"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."

149
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,521
With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you

150
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,768
within which GPS signals can't reside.

151
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,124
They get drowned out by the bubble.

152
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:11,771
And Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,

153
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,417
she felt threatened by GPS tracking.

154
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,993
Then she posted her design to the web,

155
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:20,735
and if you don't have time to build your own,

156
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,509
you can buy one.

157
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,567
Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands

158
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:27,340
of nearly identical devices on the Internet.

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,492
So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.

160
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:35,145
I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.

161
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:38,927
But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal

162
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,726
in the United States.

163
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:41,473
And why is that?

164
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:44,566
Well, because it's not a bubble at all.

165
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,965
Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge

166
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,437
of your personal space or at the edge of your car.

167
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:55,673
They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)

168
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,424
Now, if you're Carol or Limor,

169
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:01,049
or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,

170
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,824
it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,

171
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:08,804
but in fact, the results can be disastrous.

172
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:11,524
Imagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship

173
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:14,043
trying to make your way through a thick fog

174
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:17,883
and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.

175
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:20,598
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,

176
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:23,884
and now it's just you and the fog

177
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:26,484
and whatever you can pull off the radar system

178
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,608
if you remember how to work it.

179
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:35,544
They -- in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses

180
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:40,197
anymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,

181
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,617
was discontinued last year.

182
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:47,530
Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS.

183
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,800
We're almost blindly reliant on it.

184
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,451
It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.

185
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:57,079
Some call it "the invisible utility."

186
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,801
So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.

187
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:05,171
It might be deadly.

188
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,379
But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy

189
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,868
at the expense of general GPS reliability,

190
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:15,028
there's something even more potent

191
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,820
and more subversive than a Wave Bubble,

192
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,209
and that is a GPS spoofer.

193
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,034
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.

194
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:29,011
Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.

195
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,129
You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device

196
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,296
you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.

197
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,928
So let me show you how this works.

198
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,653
In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside

199
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,288
that corresponds to the authentic signals.

200
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:45,103
These three red dots represent the tracking points

201
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,982
that try to keep themselves centered on that peak.

202
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,047
But if you send in a fake GPS signal,

203
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:55,513
another peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks

204
00:10:55,513 --> 00:11:00,231
perfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,

205
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:03,542
and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,

206
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,502
with the authentic peak getting forced off.

207
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,669
At this point, the game is over.

208
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,406
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.

209
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,901
So is this really possible?

210
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,624
Can someone really manipulate

211
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:18,606
the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver

212
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:21,485
just like that, with a spoofer?

213
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,500
Well, the short answer is yes.

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,304
The key is that civil GPS signals

215
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:27,406
are completely open.

216
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:31,397
They have no encryption. They have no authentication.

217
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:34,892
They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.

218
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,467
Even so, up until very recently,

219
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,859
nobody worried about GPS spoofers.

220
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,837
People figured that it would be too complex

221
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,652
or too expensive for some hacker to build one.

222
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,604
But I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,

223
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:50,756
we didn't see it that way.

224
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:53,229
We knew it wasn't going to be so hard,

225
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,157
and we wanted to be the first to build one

226
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:57,237
so we could get out in front of the problem

227
00:11:57,237 --> 00:12:01,343
and help protect against GPS spoofing.

228
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,688
I remember vividly the week it all came together.

229
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:08,137
We built it at my home, which means that

230
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:12,526
I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.

231
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,944
Here's Ramon — (Laughter) —

232
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:18,629
looking for a little attention from Dad that week.

233
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,899
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables

234
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,781
and computers, though we eventually got it packaged

235
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:25,453
into a small box.

236
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,262
Now, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,

237
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:30,989
when the spoofer finally came alive

238
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,590
and I glimpsed its awful potential,

239
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,326
came late one night when I tested the spoofer

240
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,412
against my iPhone.

241
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,029
Let me show you some actual footage from that

242
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,965
very first experiment.

243
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:45,559
I had come to completely trust this little blue dot

244
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,194
and its reassuring blue halo.

245
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,269
They seemed to speak to me.

246
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,929
They'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)

247
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,799
And "you can trust us."

248
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,917
So something felt very wrong about the world.

249
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,500
It was a sense, almost, of betrayal,

250
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,691
when this little blue dot started at my house,

251
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,303
and went running off toward the north

252
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:13,198
leaving me behind. I wasn't moving.

253
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,431
What I then saw in this little moving blue dot

254
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,149
was the potential for chaos.

255
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,291
I saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain

256
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:28,565
learning only too late that something was wrong.

257
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:31,065
I saw the GPS-derived timing

258
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:32,796
of the New York Stock Exchange

259
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,746
being manipulated by hackers.

260
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,714
You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc

261
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,364
you could cause if you knew what you were doing

262
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:43,717
with a GPS spoofer.

263
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:48,861
There is, though, one redeeming feature

264
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,317
of the GPS spoofer.

265
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:55,918
It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.

266
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,005
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked.

267
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,529
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool,

268
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,490
pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.

269
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,205
Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend

270
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:08,522
into some empty parking lot

271
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,823
where the police are waiting for him.

272
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:16,026
So I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,

273
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:18,691
between privacy on the one hand

274
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,890
and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.

275
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,935
We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,

276
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:29,671
and yet, given the lack of effective legal means

277
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:33,770
for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,

278
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,642
can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,

279
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,058
for wanting to use them?

280
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:41,111
I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile

281
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:44,297
this conflict with some sort of,

282
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:49,727
some yet uninvented technology.

283
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,853
But meanwhile, grab some popcorn,

284
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:54,980
because things are going to get interesting.

285
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,320
Within the next few years,

286
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,574
many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.

287
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:02,922
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.

288
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:06,374
You'll never lose track of your things again.

289
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:10,403
The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.

290
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,085
But will you be able to resist the temptation

291
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,077
to track your fellow man?

292
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:17,909
Or will you be able to resist the temptation

293
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:21,204
to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble

294
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,972
to protect your own privacy?

295
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:27,604
So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon

296
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:30,944
is full of promise and peril.

297
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:34,132
It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.

298
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,766
Thanks. (Applause)
