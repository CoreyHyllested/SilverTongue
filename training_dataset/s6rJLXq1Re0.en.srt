00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,374
For the next 16 minutes,
I'm going to take you on a journey

1
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:18,484
that is probably
the biggest dream of humanity:

2
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:20,523
to understand the code of life.

3
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:23,815
So for me, everything started
many, many years ago

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,562
when I met the first 3D printer.

5
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,260
The concept was fascinating.

6
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:30,306
A 3D printer needs three elements:

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,464
a bit of information, some
raw material, some energy,

8
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:37,822
and it can produce any object
that was not there before.

9
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,654
I was doing physics,
I was coming back home

10
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:44,116
and I realized that I actually
always knew a 3D printer.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,476
And everyone does.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,658
It was my mom.

13
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:47,683
(Laughter)

14
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:50,121
My mom takes three elements:

15
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:54,118
a bit of information, which is between
my father and my mom in this case,

16
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:58,299
raw elements and energy
in the same media, that is food,

17
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,831
and after several months, produces me.

18
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,667
And I was not existent before.

19
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:06,453
So apart from the shock of my mom
discovering that she was a 3D printer,

20
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:11,215
I immediately got mesmerized
by that piece,

21
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,956
the first one, the information.

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,231
What amount of information does it take

23
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,191
to build and assemble a human?

24
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:18,789
Is it much? Is it little?

25
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,993
How many thumb drives can you fill?

26
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,641
Well, I was studying physics
at the beginning

27
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:29,262
and I took this approximation of a human
as a gigantic Lego piece.

28
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:33,071
So, imagine that the building
blocks are little atoms

29
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:37,748
and there is a hydrogen here,
a carbon here, a nitrogen here.

30
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,343
So in the first approximation,

31
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:43,710
if I can list the number of atoms
that compose a human being,

32
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,121
I can build it.

33
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:47,174
Now, you can run some numbers

34
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:50,475
and that happens to be
quite an astonishing number.

35
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,256
So the number of atoms,

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,035
the file that I will save in my thumb
drive to assemble a little baby,

37
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:02,726
will actually fill an entire Titanic
of thumb drives --

38
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,468
multiplied 2,000 times.

39
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:09,358
This is the miracle of life.

40
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:11,994
Every time you see from now on
a pregnant lady,

41
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:14,874
she's assembling the biggest
amount of information

42
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:16,454
that you will ever encounter.

43
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:19,428
Forget big data, forget
anything you heard of.

44
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:22,333
This is the biggest amount
of information that exists.

45
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:26,190
(Applause)

46
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:30,858
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter
than a young physicist,

47
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:34,458
and in four billion years, managed
to pack this information

48
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,187
in a small crystal we call DNA.

49
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,917
We met it for the first time in 1950
when Rosalind Franklin,

50
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,497
an amazing scientist, a woman,

51
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:44,910
took a picture of it.

52
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:50,122
But it took us more than 40 years
to finally poke inside a human cell,

53
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,748
take out this crystal,

54
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,852
unroll it, and read it for the first time.

55
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:58,856
The code comes out to be
a fairly simple alphabet,

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,652
four letters: A, T, C and G.

57
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:06,166
And to build a human,
you need three billion of them.

58
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,112
Three billion.

59
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:09,715
How many are three billion?

60
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,501
It doesn't really make
any sense as a number, right?

61
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,610
So I was thinking how
I could explain myself better

62
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:19,684
about how big and enormous this code is.

63
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,762
But there is -- I mean,
I'm going to have some help,

64
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,013
and the best person to help me
introduce the code

65
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:29,559
is actually the first man
to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.

66
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,973
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.

67
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:39,928
(Applause)

68
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,208
Not the man in the flesh,

69
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:45,793
but for the first time in history,

70
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:49,279
this is the genome of a specific human,

71
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:53,063
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:

72
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:57,083
262,000 pages of information,

73
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:01,471
450 kilograms, shipped
from the United States to Canada

74
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:06,338
thanks to Bruno Bowden,
Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.

75
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:07,825
It was an amazing feat.

76
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,146
But this is the visual perception
of what is the code of life.

77
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,648
And now, for the first time,
I can do something fun.

78
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,219
I can actually poke inside it and read.

79
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:21,868
So let me take an interesting
book ... like this one.

80
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,611
I have an annotation;
it's a fairly big book.

81
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,362
So just to let you see
what is the code of life.

82
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,957
Thousands and thousands and thousands

83
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,651
and millions of letters.

84
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,071
And they apparently make sense.

85
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,852
Let's get to a specific part.

86
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,933
Let me read it to you:

87
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:45,978
(Laughter)

88
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:50,008
"AAG, AAT, ATA."

89
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,032
To you it sounds like mute letters,

90
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:57,097
but this sequence gives
the color of the eyes to Craig.

91
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,565
I'll show you another part of the book.

92
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,683
This is actually a little
more complicated.

93
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,630
Chromosome 14, book 132:

94
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,744
(Laughter)

95
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,045
As you might expect.

96
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,535
(Laughter)

97
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:19,364
"ATT, CTT, GATT."

98
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,016
This human is lucky,

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,557
because if you miss just
two letters in this position --

100
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,458
two letters of our three billion --

101
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,501
he will be condemned
to a terrible disease:

102
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,965
cystic fibrosis.

103
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:35,402
We have no cure for it,
we don't know how to solve it,

104
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:39,181
and it's just two letters
of difference from what we are.

105
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:42,290
A wonderful book, a mighty book,

106
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,113
a mighty book that helped me understand

107
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,890
and show you something quite remarkable.

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,915
Every one of you -- what makes
me, me and you, you --

109
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,893
is just about five million of these,

110
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,145
half a book.

111
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,678
For the rest,

112
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:02,264
we are all absolutely identical.

113
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:07,026
Five hundred pages
is the miracle of life that you are.

114
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,581
The rest, we all share it.

115
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:12,514
So think about that again
when we think that we are different.

116
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,759
This is the amount that we share.

117
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,870
So now that I have your attention,

118
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,253
the next question is:

119
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:21,428
How do I read it?

120
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:22,961
How do I make sense out of it?

121
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,649
Well, for however good you can be
at assembling Swedish furniture,

122
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:31,236
this instruction manual
is nothing you can crack in your life.

123
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,863
(Laughter)

124
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,999
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,

125
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,563
Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,

126
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,514
decided to assemble a new company.

127
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:41,950
Human Longevity was born,

128
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:43,344
with one mission:

129
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,229
trying everything we can try

130
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:48,012
and learning everything
we can learn from these books,

131
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,741
with one target --

132
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:53,663
making real the dream
of personalized medicine,

133
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:57,454
understanding what things
should be done to have better health

134
00:06:57,478 --> 00:06:59,761
and what are the secrets in these books.

135
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:04,579
An amazing team, 40 data scientists
and many, many more people,

136
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:05,953
a pleasure to work with.

137
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:08,230
The concept is actually very simple.

138
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:11,412
We're going to use a technology
called machine learning.

139
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:15,975
On one side, we have genomes --
thousands of them.

140
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,996
On the other side, we collected
the biggest database of human beings:

141
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,316
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --
everything you can think of.

142
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,239
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

143
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,705
there is the secret of translation.

144
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,201
And in the middle, we build a machine.

145
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,186
We build a machine
and we train a machine --

146
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,420
well, not exactly one machine,
many, many machines --

147
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:42,988
to try to understand and translate
the genome in a phenotype.

148
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,702
What are those letters,
and what do they do?

149
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:49,473
It's an approach that can
be used for everything,

150
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:52,490
but using it in genomics
is particularly complicated.

151
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,790
Little by little we grew and we wanted
to build different challenges.

152
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,546
We started from the beginning,
from common traits.

153
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,173
Common traits are comfortable
because they are common,

154
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,381
everyone has them.

155
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,899
So we started to ask our questions:

156
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:06,303
Can we predict height?

157
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,162
Can we read the books
and predict your height?

158
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:10,337
Well, we actually can,

159
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,154
with five centimeters of precision.

160
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:15,313
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,

161
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:19,201
but we still can, we get in the ballpark,
eight kilograms of precision.

162
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,456
Can we predict eye color?

163
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,638
Yeah, we can.

164
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:22,986
Eighty percent accuracy.

165
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,324
Can we predict skin color?

166
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,789
Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.

167
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,153
Can we predict age?

168
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:33,860
We can, because apparently,
the code changes during your life.

169
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:37,166
It gets shorter, you lose pieces,
it gets insertions.

170
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,745
We read the signals, and we make a model.

171
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,913
Now, an interesting challenge:

172
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,666
Can we predict a human face?

173
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,292
It's a little complicated,

174
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:49,507
because a human face is scattered
among millions of these letters.

175
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:52,160
And a human face is not
a very well-defined object.

176
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,235
So, we had to build an entire tier of it

177
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:56,969
to learn and teach
a machine what a face is,

178
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:59,030
and embed and compress it.

179
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,302
And if you're comfortable
with machine learning,

180
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,610
you understand what the challenge is here.

181
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:10,099
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after
we read the first sequence --

182
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:13,025
this October, we started
to see some signals.

183
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,504
And it was a very emotional moment.

184
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:19,273
What you see here is a subject
coming in our lab.

185
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,547
This is a face for us.

186
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,202
So we take the real face of a subject,
we reduce the complexity,

187
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,196
because not everything is in your face --

188
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,006
lots of features and defects
and asymmetries come from your life.

189
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,499
We symmetrize the face,
and we run our algorithm.

190
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:37,143
The results that I show you right now,

191
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,539
this is the prediction we have
from the blood.

192
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,120
(Applause)

193
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:44,579
Wait a second.

194
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:49,295
In these seconds, your eyes are watching,
left and right, left and right,

195
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:53,249
and your brain wants
those pictures to be identical.

196
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,719
So I ask you to do
another exercise, to be honest.

197
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:58,030
Please search for the differences,

198
00:09:58,054 --> 00:09:59,415
which are many.

199
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,042
The biggest amount of signal
comes from gender,

200
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:07,267
then there is age, BMI,
the ethnicity component of a human.

201
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:11,002
And scaling up over that signal
is much more complicated.

202
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,276
But what you see here,
even in the differences,

203
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,895
lets you understand
that we are in the right ballpark,

204
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,267
that we are getting closer.

205
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,640
And it's already giving you some emotions.

206
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,367
This is another subject
that comes in place,

207
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,800
and this is a prediction.

208
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:30,420
A little smaller face, we didn't get
the complete cranial structure,

209
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,095
but still, it's in the ballpark.

210
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,858
This is a subject that comes in our lab,

211
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,325
and this is the prediction.

212
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:42,732
So these people have never been seen
in the training of the machine.

213
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,593
These are the so-called "held-out" set.

214
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:49,357
But these are people that you will
probably never believe.

215
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,057
We're publishing everything
in a scientific publication,

216
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,232
you can read it.

217
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,600
But since we are onstage,
Chris challenged me.

218
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:59,250
I probably exposed myself
and tried to predict

219
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:02,105
someone that you might recognize.

220
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,895
So, in this vial of blood --
and believe me, you have no idea

221
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,799
what we had to do to have
this blood now, here --

222
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:13,724
in this vial of blood is the amount
of biological information

223
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,025
that we need to do a full genome sequence.

224
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,119
We just need this amount.

225
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:21,733
We ran this sequence,
and I'm going to do it with you.

226
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:25,736
And we start to layer up
all the understanding we have.

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,110
In the vial of blood,
we predicted he's a male.

228
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,498
And the subject is a male.

229
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:33,434
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.

230
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,850
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.

231
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:39,984
So, we predicted that he's 76;
the subject is 82.

232
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,333
We predict his age, 38.

233
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,261
The subject is 35.

234
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:47,975
We predict his eye color.

235
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:50,035
Too dark.

236
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,614
We predict his skin color.

237
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,436
We are almost there.

238
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,272
That's his face.

239
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,441
Now, the reveal moment:

240
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,235
the subject is this person.

241
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,194
(Laughter)

242
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,276
And I did it intentionally.

243
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,992
I am a very particular
and peculiar ethnicity.

244
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,966
Southern European, Italians --
they never fit in models.

245
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,120
And it's particular -- that ethnicity
is a complex corner case for our model.

246
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,653
But there is another point.

247
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:23,154
So, one of the things that we use
a lot to recognize people

248
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,900
will never be written in the genome.

249
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,241
It's our free will, it's how I look.

250
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:30,494
Not my haircut in this case,
but my beard cut.

251
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:34,071
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,
in this case, transfer it --

252
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:36,860
and this is nothing more
than Photoshop, no modeling --

253
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,597
the beard on the subject.

254
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:42,093
And immediately, we get
much, much better in the feeling.

255
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:45,664
So, why do we do this?

256
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:53,078
We certainly don't do it
for predicting height

257
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:55,474
or taking a beautiful picture
out of your blood.

258
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,408
We do it because the same technology
and the same approach,

259
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,952
the machine learning of this code,

260
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:06,113
is helping us to understand how we work,

261
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:07,623
how your body works,

262
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,312
how your body ages,

263
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:12,105
how disease generates in your body,

264
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,101
how your cancer grows and develops,

265
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,908
how drugs work

266
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,246
and if they work on your body.

267
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,380
This is a huge challenge.

268
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,532
This is a challenge that we share

269
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,135
with thousands of other
researchers around the world.

270
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,381
It's called personalized medicine.

271
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,585
It's the ability to move
from a statistical approach

272
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,641
where you're a dot in the ocean,

273
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,478
to a personalized approach,

274
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,687
where we read all these books

275
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:41,575
and we get an understanding
of exactly how you are.

276
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,622
But it is a particularly
complicated challenge,

277
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:49,644
because of all these books, as of today,

278
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:52,310
we just know probably two percent:

279
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:56,680
four books of more than 175.

280
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:01,227
And this is not the topic of my talk,

281
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,743
because we will learn more.

282
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,047
There are the best minds
in the world on this topic.

283
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,882
The prediction will get better,

284
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:13,159
the model will get more precise.

285
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,041
And the more we learn,

286
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:19,895
the more we will
be confronted with decisions

287
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,940
that we never had to face before

288
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,399
about life,

289
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,097
about death,

290
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,724
about parenting.

291
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:37,372
So, we are touching the very
inner detail on how life works.

292
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:41,276
And it's a revolution
that cannot be confined

293
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,959
in the domain of science or technology.

294
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,204
This must be a global conversation.

295
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:53,015
We must start to think of the future
we're building as a humanity.

296
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,103
We need to interact with creatives,
with artists, with philosophers,

297
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,637
with politicians.

298
00:14:58,661 --> 00:14:59,819
Everyone is involved,

299
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:02,668
because it's the future of our species.

300
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:07,241
Without fear, but with the understanding

301
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:11,136
that the decisions
that we make in the next year

302
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,949
will change the course of history forever.

303
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:16,892
Thank you.

304
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:27,075
(Applause)
