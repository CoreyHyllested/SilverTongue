00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,056
Twelve years ago, I picked up
a camera for the first time

1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,200
to film the olive harvest
in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,296
I thought I was there
to make a single documentary

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,176
and would then move on
to some other part of the world.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,480
But something kept bringing me back.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,296
Now, usually, when international audiences
hear about that part of the world,

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,856
they often just want
that conflict to go away.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,520
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
and we wish it could just disappear.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,480
We feel much the same way
about other conflicts around the world.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,296
But every time we turn
our attention to the news,

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,280
it seems like one more country
has gone up in flames.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,016
So I've been wondering

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,360
whether we should not start
looking at conflict in a different way --

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,136
whether instead of simply
wishing to end conflict,

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,176
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,256
This has been a big question for me,

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,920
one I've pursued together with my team
at the nonprofit Just Vision.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,416
After witnessing several different kinds
of struggles in the Middle East,

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,656
I started noticing some patterns
on the more successful ones.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,816
I wondered whether these variables
held across cases, and if they did,

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,736
what lessons we could glean
for waging constructive conflict,

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,600
in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,920
There is some science about this.

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,936
In a study of 323
major political conflicts

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,936
from 1900 to 2006,

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,256
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
found that nonviolent campaigns

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,520
were almost 100 percent more likely
to lead to success than violent campaigns.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,376
Nonviolent campaigns are also
less likely to cause physical harm

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,336
to those waging the campaign,

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,496
as well as their opponents.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,400
And, critically, they typically lead
to more peaceful and democratic societies.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,136
In other words, nonviolent resistance
is a more effective and constructive way

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
of waging conflict.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,920
But if that's such an easy choice,
why don't more groups use it?

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,896
Political scientist Victor Asal
and colleagues

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,696
have looked at several factors

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,280
that shape a political group's
choice of tactics.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,160
And it turns out
that the greatest predictor

38
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,336
of a movement's decision
to adopt nonviolence or violence

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,696
is not whether that group
is more left-wing or right-wing,

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,816
not whether the group is more or less
influenced by religious beliefs,

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,896
not whether it's up against
a democracy or a dictatorship,

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,520
and not even the levels of repression
that that group is facing.

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,320
The greatest predictor of a movement's
decision to adopt nonviolence

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,560
is its ideology regarding
the role of women in public life.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,600
(Applause)

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,096
When a movement includes in its discourse

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,856
language around gender equality,

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,216
it increases dramatically
the chances it will adopt nonviolence,

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,560
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,056
The research squared up
with my own documentation

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,416
of political organizing
in Israel and Palestine.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,856
I've noticed that movements which
welcome women into leadership positions,

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,176
such as the one I documented
in a village called Budrus,

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,800
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,936
This village was under a real threat
of being wiped off the map

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,800
when Israel started building
the separation barrier.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,416
The proposed route would require

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,936
the destruction of this community's
olive groves, their cemeteries

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
and would ultimately
close the village from all sides.

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,536
Through inspired local leadership,

61
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,200
they launched a nonviolent resistance
campaign to stop that from happening.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,520
The odds were massively
stacked against them.

63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
But they had a secret weapon:

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,656
a 15-year-old girl

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,416
who courageously jumped
in front of a bulldozer

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,920
which was about to uproot
an olive tree, stopping it.

67
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,216
In that moment, the community
of Budrus realized what was possible

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,840
if they welcomed and encouraged women
to participate in public life.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,416
And so it was that the women of Budrus
went to the front lines day after day,

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,896
using their creativity and acumen
to overcome multiple obstacles they faced

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,000
in a 10-month unarmed struggle.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And as you can probably
tell at this point,

73
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:50,224
they win at the end.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,696
The separation barrier
was changed completely

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,456
to the internationally
recognized green line,

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,216
and the women of Budrus
came to be known across the West Bank

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
for their indomitable energy.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,296
(Applause)

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank you.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,256
I want to pause for a second,
which you helped me do,

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,216
because I do want to tackle
two very serious misunderstandings

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
that could happen at this point.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,256
The first one is that I don't believe

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,320
women are inherently or essentially
more peaceful than men.

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,176
But I do believe that in today's world,

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,080
women experience power differently.

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,456
Having had to navigate
being in the less powerful position

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,216
in multiple aspects of their lives,

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,576
women are often more adept

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,856
at how to surreptitiously
pressure for change

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,616
against large, powerful actors.

92
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,816
The term "manipulative," often charged
against women in a derogatory way,

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,816
reflects a reality in which women
have often had to find ways

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,240
other than direct confrontation
to achieve their goals.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,976
And finding alternatives
to direct confrontation

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,080
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,856
Now to the second
potential misunderstanding.

98
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,896
I've been talking a lot about
my experiences in the Middle East,

99
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,736
and some of you might be thinking now

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,536
that the solution then is for us
to educate Muslim and Arab societies

101
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,280
to be more inclusive of their women.

102
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,840
If we were to do that,
they would be more successful.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,120
They do not need this kind of help.

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,296
Women have been part
of the most influential movements

105
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
coming out of the Middle East,

106
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,056
but they tend to be invisible
to the international community.

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,816
Our cameras are largely focused on the men

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,896
who often end up involved
in the more confrontational scenes

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,440
that we find so irresistible
in our news cycle.

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,936
And we end up with a narrative
that not only erases women

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,896
from the struggles in the region

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,560
but often misrepresents
the struggles themselves.

113
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,256
In the late 1980s,
an uprising started in Gaza,

114
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,360
and quickly spread to the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,616
It came to be known as the First Intifada,

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,976
and people who have
any visual memory of it

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
generally conjure up something like this:

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
Palestinian men
throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,296
The news coverage at the time

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,056
made it seem like stones,
Molotov cocktails and burning tires

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,120
were the only activities
taking place in the Intifada.

122
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,336
This period, though, was also marked
by widespread nonviolent organizing

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,080
in the forms of strikes, sit-ins
and the creation of parallel institutions.

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,256
During the First Intifada,

125
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,616
whole sectors of the Palestinian
civilian population mobilized,

126
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,400
cutting across generations,
factions and class lines.

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,896
They did this through networks
of popular committees,

128
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,416
and their use of direct action
and communal self-help projects

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,856
challenged Israel's very ability

130
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,560
to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,936
According to the Israeli Army itself,

132
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,520
97 percent of activities
during the First Intifada were unarmed.

133
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,640
And here's another thing that is not
part of our narrative about that time.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,776
For 18 months in the Intifada,

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,616
women were the ones
calling the shots behind the scenes:

136
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,136
Palestinian women from all walks of life

137
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,576
in charge of mobilizing
hundreds of thousands of people

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,480
in a concerted effort to withdraw
consent from the occupation.

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,056
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build
a self-sufficient Palestinian economy

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,296
by encouraging women in Gaza
to grow vegetables in their backyards,

141
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,880
an activity deemed illegal
by the Israeli authorities at that time;

142
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,776
Rabeha Diab, who took over
decision-making authority

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,216
for the entire uprising

144
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,016
when the men who had been running it

145
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,240
were deported;

146
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,936
Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets
containing the uprising's directives

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,736
in order to spread them
across the territories

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
without getting caught;

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,376
and Zahira Kamal,

150
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,696
who ensured the longevity of the uprising

151
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,256
by leading an organization

152
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,200
that went from 25 women
to 3,000 in a single year.

153
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,176
Despite their extraordinary achievements,

154
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
none of these women have made it
into our narrative of the First Intifada.

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,000
We do this in other parts
of the globe, too.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,016
In our history books, for instance,
and in our collective consciousness,

157
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,096
men are the public faces and spokespersons

158
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,200
for the 1960s struggle
for racial justice in the United States.

159
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,856
But women were also
a critical driving force,

160
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,960
mobilizing, organizing,
taking to the streets.

161
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,336
How many of us think of Septima Clark

162
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
when we think of the United States
Civil Rights era?

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
Remarkably few.

164
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,216
But she played a crucial role
in every phase of the struggle,

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,896
particularly by emphasizing
literacy and education.

166
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,416
She's been omitted, ignored,

167
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,136
like so many other women
who played critical roles

168
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,200
in the United States
Civil Rights Movement.

169
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
This is not about getting credit.

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
It's more profound than that.

171
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,536
The stories we tell matter deeply
to how we see ourselves,

172
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,256
and to how we believe movements are run

173
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,160
and how movements are won.

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,816
The stories we tell about a movement
like the First Intifada

175
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,776
or the United States Civil Rights era

176
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,896
matter deeply
and have a critical influence

177
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,576
in the choices Palestinians,

178
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,896
Americans

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,016
and people around the world will make

180
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,336
next time they encounter an injustice

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
and develop the courage to confront it.

182
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,816
If we do not lift up the women who played
critical roles in these struggles,

183
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,800
we fail to offer up role models
to future generations.

184
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,256
Without role models, it becomes harder

185
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,296
for women to take up their rightful space

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
in public life.

187
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,456
And as we saw earlier,

188
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,296
one of the most critical variables

189
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,496
in determining whether
a movement will be successful or not

190
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,536
is a movement's ideology
regarding the role of women

191
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
in public life.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,376
This is a question of whether we're moving

193
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,280
towards more democratic
and peaceful societies.

194
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,736
In a world where so much
change is happening,

195
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,000
and where change is bound to continue
at an increasingly faster pace,

196
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,600
it is not a question
of whether we will face conflict,

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,216
but rather a question

198
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,616
of which stories will shape

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,560
how we choose to wage conflict.

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,016
Thank you.

201
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,842
(Applause)
