00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:14,309
Hello, everybody.

1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,976
I brought with me today a baby diaper.

2
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:20,515
You'll see why in a second.

3
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,549
Baby diapers have interesting properties.

4
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:25,264
They can swell enormously
when you add water to them,

5
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:28,272
an experiment done
by millions of kids every day.

6
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,446
(Laughter)

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,964
But the reason why

8
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,178
is that they're designed
in a very clever way.

9
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:35,837
They're made out of a thing
called a swellable material.

10
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:38,598
It's a special kind of material that,
when you add water,

11
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,052
it will swell up enormously,

12
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,242
maybe a thousand times in volume.

13
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,502
And this is a very useful,
industrial kind of polymer.

14
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,345
But what we're trying to do
in my group at MIT

15
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,582
is to figure out if we can do
something similar to the brain.

16
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:52,765
Can we make it bigger,

17
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,467
big enough that you
can peer inside

18
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,109
and see all the tiny building blocks,
the biomolecules,

19
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,284
how they're organized in three dimensions,

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,793
the structure, the ground truth
structure of the brain, if you will?

21
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:03,975
If we could get that,

22
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,508
maybe we could have a better understanding
of how the brain is organized

23
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:09,191
to yield thoughts and emotions

24
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:10,934
and actions and sensations.

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:14,373
Maybe we could try to pinpoint
the exact changes in the brain

26
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:16,173
that result in diseases,

27
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:19,409
diseases like Alzheimer's
and epilepsy and Parkinson's,

28
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,011
for which there are few
treatments, much less cures,

29
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,652
and for which, very often,
we don't know the cause or the origins

30
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,811
and what's really causing them to occur.

31
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:30,353
Now, our group at MIT

32
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:33,063
is trying to take
a different point of view

33
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:36,317
from the way neuroscience has
been done over the last hundred years.

34
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,920
We're designers. We're inventors.

35
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:40,488
We're trying to figure out
how to build technologies

36
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,968
that let us look at and repair the brain.

37
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:44,143
And the reason is,

38
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,968
the brain is incredibly,
incredibly complicated.

39
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:50,371
So what we've learned
over the first century of neuroscience

40
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,698
is that the brain is a very
complicated network,

41
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:55,202
made out of very specialized
cells called neurons

42
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,893
with very complex geometries,

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,154
and electrical currents will flow
through these complexly shaped neurons.

44
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:04,437
Furthermore, neurons
are connected in networks.

45
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:08,296
They're connected by little junctions
called synapses that exchange chemicals

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,538
and allow the neurons
to talk to each other.

47
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,502
The density of the brain is incredible.

48
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,833
In a cubic millimeter of your brain,

49
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,314
there are about 100,000 of these neurons

50
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,855
and maybe a billion of those connections.

51
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,269
But it's worse.

52
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,598
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,

53
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,372
and, of course, this is just
our artist's rendition of it.

54
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:31,603
What you would see are thousands
and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,

55
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:36,027
little nanoscale machines
organized in complex, 3D patterns,

56
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:38,679
and together they mediate
those electrical pulses,

57
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:42,640
those chemical exchanges
that allow neurons to work together

58
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:46,333
to generate things like thoughts
and feelings and so forth.

59
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:50,121
Now, we don't know how
the neurons in the brain are organized

60
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,319
to form networks,

61
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,843
and we don't know how
the biomolecules are organized

62
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,041
within neurons

63
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,470
to form these complex, organized machines.

64
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,738
If we really want to understand this,

65
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,579
we're going to need new technologies.

66
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:03,387
But if we could get such maps,

67
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:06,354
if we could look at the organization
of molecules and neurons

68
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,944
and neurons and networks,

69
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:11,405
maybe we could really understand
how the brain conducts information

70
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:12,596
from sensory regions,

71
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,356
mixes it with emotion and feeling,

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,774
and generates our decisions and actions.

73
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:20,920
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set
of molecular changes that occur

74
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,146
in a brain disorder.

75
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,992
And once we know how
those molecules have changed,

76
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,796
whether they've increased in number
or changed in pattern,

77
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,759
we could use those
as targets for new drugs,

78
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:33,054
for new ways of delivering
energy into the brain

79
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:36,958
in order to repair the brain
computations that are afflicted

80
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,281
in patients who suffer
from brain disorders.

81
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:43,036
We've all seen lots of different
technologies over the last century

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,226
to try to confront this.

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,130
I think we've all seen brain scans

84
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,188
taken using MRI machines.

85
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:51,559
These, of course, have the great power
that they are noninvasive,

86
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,938
they can be used on living human subjects.

87
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,638
But also, they're spatially crude.

88
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:59,652
Each of these blobs that you see,
or voxels, as they're called,

89
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:02,365
can contain millions
and millions of neurons.

90
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,239
So it's not at the level of resolution

91
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:06,801
where it can pinpoint
the molecular changes that occur

92
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,111
or the changes in the wiring
of these networks

93
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:13,081
that contributes to our ability
to be conscious and powerful beings.

94
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:16,978
At the other extreme,
you have microscopes.

95
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,297
Microscopes, of course, will use light
to look at little tiny things.

96
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,396
For centuries, they've been used
to look at things like bacteria.

97
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,571
For neuroscience,

98
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:28,007
microscopes are actually how neurons
were discovered in the first place,

99
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,323
about 130 years ago.

100
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:31,665
But light is fundamentally limited.

101
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,987
You can't see individual molecules
with a regular old microscope.

102
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:37,163
You can't look at these tiny connections.

103
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:41,129
So if we want to make our ability
to see the brain more powerful,

104
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,321
to get down to the ground truth structure,

105
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:46,625
we're going to need to have
even better technologies.

106
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,835
My group, a couple years ago,
started thinking:

107
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:51,271
Why don't we do the opposite?

108
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,756
If it's so darn complicated
to zoom in to the brain,

109
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,723
why can't we make the brain bigger?

110
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,321
It initially started

111
00:04:57,345 --> 00:05:00,341
with two grad students in my group,
Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.

112
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,085
Now many others in my group
are helping with this process.

113
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:05,871
We decided to try to figure out
if we could take polymers,

114
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:07,524
like the stuff in the baby diaper,

115
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,554
and install it physically
within the brain.

116
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,819
If we could do it just right,
and you add water,

117
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,678
you can potentially blow the brain up

118
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:17,079
to where you could distinguish
those tiny biomolecules from each other.

119
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,973
You would see those connections
and get maps of the brain.

120
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,985
This could potentially be quite dramatic.

121
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,017
We brought a little demo here.

122
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:28,113
We got some purified baby diaper material.

123
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,411
It's much easier
just to buy it off the Internet

124
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,910
than to extract the few grains
that actually occur in these diapers.

125
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,159
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here

126
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,500
of this purified polymer.

127
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,422
And here we have some water.

128
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,608
What we're going to do

129
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:45,643
is see if this teaspoon
of the baby diaper material

130
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,376
can increase in size.

131
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:52,383
You're going to see it increase in volume
by about a thousandfold

132
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:53,693
before your very eyes.

133
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:03,569
I could pour much more of this in there,

134
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,151
but I think you've got the idea

135
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,677
that this is a very,
very interesting molecule,

136
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,613
and if can use it in the right way,

137
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,958
we might be able
to really zoom in on the brain

138
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,576
in a way that you can't do
with past technologies.

139
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:17,281
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.

140
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,747
What's going on
in the baby diaper polymer?

141
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,447
If you could zoom in,

142
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,144
it might look something like
what you see on the screen.

143
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:28,660
Polymers are chains of atoms
arranged in long, thin lines.

144
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,051
The chains are very tiny,

145
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:31,939
about the width of a biomolecule,

146
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,710
and these polymers are really dense.

147
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,234
They're separated by distances

148
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,510
that are around the size of a biomolecule.

149
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:38,699
This is very good

150
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:41,764
because we could potentially
move everything apart in the brain.

151
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,636
If we add water, what will happen is,

152
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,175
this swellable material
is going to absorb the water,

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,599
the polymer chains will move
apart from each other,

154
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,257
and the entire material
is going to become bigger.

155
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,429
And because these chains are so tiny

156
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,658
and spaced by biomolecular distances,

157
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,721
we could potentially blow up the brain

158
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,378
and make it big enough to see.

159
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,260
Here's the mystery, then:

160
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:04,894
How do we actually make
these polymer chains inside the brain

161
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,157
so we can move all the biomolecules apart?

162
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,332
If we could do that,

163
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:10,753
maybe we could get
ground truth maps of the brain.

164
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,166
We could look at the wiring.

165
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,347
We can peer inside
and see the molecules within.

166
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:18,406
To explain this, we made some animations

167
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,033
where we actually look
at, in these artist renderings,

168
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:24,598
what biomolecules might look
like and how we might separate them.

169
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,171
Step one: what we'd have
to do, first of all,

170
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:30,584
is attach every biomolecule,
shown in brown here,

171
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,767
to a little anchor, a little handle.

172
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,886
We need to pull the molecules
of the brain apart from each other,

173
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,236
and to do that, we need
to have a little handle

174
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,545
that allows those polymers to bind to them

175
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,111
and to exert their force.

176
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:46,439
Now, if you just take baby diaper
polymer and dump it on the brain,

177
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:48,500
obviously, it's going to sit there on top.

178
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:51,052
So we need to find a way
to make the polymers inside.

179
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,864
And this is where we're really lucky.

180
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,076
It turns out, you can
get the building blocks,

181
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,472
monomers, as they're called,

182
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,280
and if you let them go into the brain

183
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,340
and then trigger the chemical reactions,

184
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:03,066
you can get them to form
those long chains,

185
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,888
right there inside the brain tissue.

186
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,722
They're going to wind their way
around biomolecules

187
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,967
and between biomolecules,

188
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,616
forming those complex webs

189
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,502
that will allow you, eventually,
to pull apart the molecules

190
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,701
from each other.

191
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,779
And every time one
of those little handles is around,

192
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:21,153
the polymer will bind to the handle,
and that's exactly what we need

193
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,708
in order to pull the molecules
apart from each other.

194
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,425
All right, the moment of truth.

195
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,597
We have to treat this specimen

196
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,067
with a chemical to kind of loosen up
all the molecules from each other,

197
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,927
and then, when we add water,

198
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,904
that swellable material is going
to start absorbing the water,

199
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,631
the polymer chains will move apart,

200
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:40,377
but now, the biomolecules
will come along for the ride.

201
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,565
And much like drawing
a picture on a balloon,

202
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,176
and then you blow up the balloon,

203
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,490
the image is the same,

204
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:48,062
but the ink particles have moved
away from each other.

205
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,553
And that's what we've been able
to do now, but in three dimensions.

206
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:53,576
There's one last trick.

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,818
As you can see here,

208
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,951
we've color-coded
all the biomolecules brown.

209
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,145
That's because they all
kind of look the same.

210
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,274
Biomolecules are made
out of the same atoms,

211
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,538
but just in different orders.

212
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:05,062
So we need one last thing

213
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,781
in order to make them visible.

214
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,384
We have to bring in little tags,

215
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:11,427
with glowing dyes
that will distinguish them.

216
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,124
So one kind of biomolecule
might get a blue color.

217
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,499
Another kind of biomolecule
might get a red color.

218
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,799
And so forth.

219
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,375
And that's the final step.

220
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,677
Now we can look at something like a brain

221
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:23,497
and look at the individual molecules,

222
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,228
because we've moved them
far apart enough from each other

223
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:27,950
that we can tell them apart.

224
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:30,808
So the hope here is that
we can make the invisible visible.

225
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,398
We can turn things that might seem
small and obscure

226
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,573
and blow them up

227
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:37,774
until they're like constellations
of information about life.

228
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:40,173
Here's an actual video
of what it might look like.

229
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,568
We have here a little brain in a dish --

230
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,339
a little piece of a brain, actually.

231
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:45,959
We've infused the polymer in,

232
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,450
and now we're adding water.

233
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,832
What you'll see is that,
right before your eyes --

234
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,779
this video is sped up about sixtyfold --

235
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:54,528
this little piece of brain tissue
is going to grow.

236
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,732
It can increase by a hundredfold
or even more in volume.

237
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:00,705
And the cool part is, because
those polymers are so tiny,

238
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:03,288
we're separating biomolecules
evenly from each other.

239
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,970
It's a smooth expansion.

240
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,681
We're not losing the configuration
of the information.

241
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:10,405
We're just making it easier to see.

242
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,509
So now we can take
actual brain circuitry --

243
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,667
here's a piece of the brain
involved with, for example, memory --

244
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:17,954
and we can zoom in.

245
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:20,868
We can start to actually look at
how circuits are configured.

246
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,860
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.

247
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,663
Maybe we could actually look
at how circuits are configured

248
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:26,839
to process emotions,

249
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,785
how the actual wiring
of our brain is organized

250
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,376
in order to make us who we are.

251
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,447
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,

252
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,630
the actual problems in the brain
at a molecular level.

253
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:40,223
What if we could actually
look into cells in the brain

254
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:43,330
and figure out, wow, here are the 17
molecules that have altered

255
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,809
in this brain tissue that has been
undergoing epilepsy

256
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,483
or changing in Parkinson's disease

257
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,024
or otherwise being altered?

258
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,091
If we get that systematic list
of things that are going wrong,

259
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,314
those become our therapeutic targets.

260
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,015
We can build drugs that bind those.

261
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,666
We can maybe aim energy
at different parts of the brain

262
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,377
in order to help people
with Parkinson's or epilepsy

263
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,952
or other conditions that affect
over a billion people

264
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:06,189
around the world.

265
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,452
Now, something interesting
has been happening.

266
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:12,181
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,

267
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,871
there are other problems
that expansion might help with.

268
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:18,129
This is an actual biopsy
from a human breast cancer patient.

269
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,693
It turns out that if you look at cancers,

270
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,328
if you look at the immune system,

271
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,865
if you look at aging,
if you look at development --

272
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:29,386
all these processes are involving
large-scale biological systems.

273
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,434
But of course, the problems begin
with those little nanoscale molecules,

274
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,327
the machines that make the cells
and the organs in our body tick.

275
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,573
So what we're trying
to do now is to figure out

276
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:43,063
if we can actually use this technology
to map the building blocks of life

277
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:44,832
in a wide variety of diseases.

278
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:47,752
Can we actually pinpoint
the molecular changes in a tumor

279
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,145
so that we can actually
go after it in a smart way

280
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:54,113
and deliver drugs that might wipe out
exactly the cells that we want to?

281
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,472
You know, a lot of medicine
is very high risk.

282
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,278
Sometimes, it's even guesswork.

283
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:02,501
My hope is we can actually turn
what might be a high-risk moon shot

284
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,294
into something that's more reliable.

285
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,373
If you think about the original moon shot,

286
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,295
where they actually landed on the moon,

287
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,763
it was based on solid science.

288
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,390
We understood gravity;

289
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,755
we understood aerodynamics.

290
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,174
We knew how to build rockets.

291
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,666
The science risk was under control.

292
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,443
It was still a great, great
feat of engineering.

293
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,112
But in medicine, we don't
necessarily have all the laws.

294
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:25,245
Do we have all the laws
that are analogous to gravity,

295
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,613
that are analogous to aerodynamics?

296
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,367
I would argue that with technologies

297
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:31,263
like the kinds I'm talking about today,

298
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:32,980
maybe we can actually derive those.

299
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:35,861
We can map the patterns
that occur in living systems,

300
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:40,443
and figure out how to overcome
the diseases that plague us.

301
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,578
You know, my wife and I
have two young kids,

302
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,836
and one of my hopes as a bioengineer
is to make life better for them

303
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,589
than it currently is for us.

304
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:52,343
And my hope is, if we can
turn biology and medicine

305
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:56,724
from these high-risk endeavors
that are governed by chance and luck,

306
00:12:56,748 --> 00:13:00,675
and make them things
that we win by skill and hard work,

307
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,597
then that would be a great advance.

308
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,827
Thank you very much.

309
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:14,234
(Applause)
