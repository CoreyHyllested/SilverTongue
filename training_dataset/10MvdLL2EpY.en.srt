00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,261
[On April 3, 2016 we saw
the largest data leak in history.]

1
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,892
[The Panama Papers exposed
rich and powerful people]

2
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,382
[hiding vast amounts of money
in offshore accounts.]

3
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:26,338
[What does this mean?]

4
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:30,212
[We called Robert Palmer
of Global Witness to explain.]

5
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:37,804
This week, there have been
a whole slew and deluge of stories

6
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:41,124
coming out from the leak
of 11 million documents

7
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:45,572
from a Panamanian-based law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.

8
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:51,378
The release of these papers from Panama
lifts the veil on a tiny piece

9
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,640
of the secretive offshore world.

10
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:58,972
We get an insight into how clients
and banks and lawyers

11
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,024
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca

12
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:03,555
and say, "OK, we want
an anonymous company,

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:04,971
can you give us one?"

14
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,805
So you actually get to see the emails,

15
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,792
you get to see the exchanges of messages,

16
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,891
you get to see the mechanics
of how this works,

17
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,316
how this operates.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,393
Now, this has already started
to have pretty immediate repercussions.

19
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:20,018
The Prime Minister
of Iceland has resigned.

20
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:21,257
We've also had news

21
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:26,324
that an ally of the brutal
Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad

22
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:28,903
has also got offshore companies.

23
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:34,156
There's been allegations
of a $2 billion money trail

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,083
that leads back to President
Vladimir Putin of Russia

25
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,568
via his close childhood friend,

26
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,820
who happens to be a top cellist.

27
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:45,444
And there will be a lot
of rich individuals out there

28
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:49,786
and others who will be nervous
about the next set of stories

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,363
and the next set of leaked documents.

30
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:56,573
Now, this sounds like the plot
of a spy thriller

31
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,260
or a John Grisham novel.

32
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,300
It seems very distant
from you, me, ordinary people.

33
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:04,832
Why should we care about this?

34
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:09,099
But the truth is that if rich
and powerful individuals

35
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:11,777
are able to keep their money offshore

36
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,288
and not pay the taxes that they should,

37
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:18,406
it means that there is less money
for vital public services

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,783
like healthcare, education, roads.

39
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,128
And that affects all of us.

40
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:26,868
Now, for my organization Global Witness,

41
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,954
this exposé has been phenomenal.

42
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:35,466
We have the world's media
and political leaders

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,145
talking about how individuals
can use offshore secrecy

44
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,564
to hide and disguise their assets --

45
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:47,372
something we have been talking about
and exposing for a decade.

46
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:52,031
Now, I think a lot of people find
this entire world baffling and confusing,

47
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:56,520
and hard to understand how
this sort of offshore world works.

48
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,376
I like to think of it a bit
like a Russian doll.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,859
So you can have one company
stacked inside another company,

50
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,994
stacked inside another company,

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,429
making it almost impossible
to really understand

52
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,680
who is behind these structures.

53
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:14,617
It can be very difficult
for law enforcement

54
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,604
or tax authorities,
journalists, civil society

55
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:19,890
to really understand what's going on.

56
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:21,755
I also think it's interesting

57
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:24,986
that there's been less coverage
of this issue in the United States.

58
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,773
And that's perhaps because
some prominent US people

59
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:33,335
just haven't figured
in this exposé, in this scandal.

60
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,294
Now, that's not because
there are no rich Americans

61
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,128
who are stashing their assets offshore.

62
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,974
It's just because of the way
in which offshore works,

63
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:47,488
Mossack Fonseca has fewer
American clients.

64
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:50,768
I think if we saw leaks
from the Cayman Islands

65
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:54,443
or even from Delaware
or Wyoming or Nevada,

66
00:03:54,467 --> 00:04:00,259
you would see many more cases
and examples linking back to Americans.

67
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:06,201
In fact, in a number of US states
you need less information,

68
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:10,399
you need to provide less
information to get a company

69
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:13,216
than you do to get a library card.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,022
That sort of secrecy in America
has allowed employees of school districts

71
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:20,952
to rip off schoolchildren.

72
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:25,872
It has allowed scammers
to rip off vulnerable investors.

73
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:30,142
This is the sort of behavior
that affects all of us.

74
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,037
Now, at Global Witness,

75
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,322
we wanted to see what this
actually looked like in practice.

76
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,759
How does this actually work?

77
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:38,958
So what we did

78
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:45,219
is we sent in an undercover investigator
to 13 Manhattan law firms.

79
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:49,537
Our investigator posed
as an African minister

80
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:53,688
who wanted to move suspect funds
into the United States

81
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:56,851
to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.

82
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:02,349
Now, what was truly shocking
was that all but one of those lawyers

83
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:06,966
provided our investigator with suggestions

84
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,954
on how to move those suspect funds.

85
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,790
These were all preliminary meetings,

86
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,086
and none of the lawyers
took us on as a client

87
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,399
and of course no money moved hands,

88
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:18,881
but it really shows the problem
with the system.

89
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,824
It's also important

90
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:24,214
to not just think about this
as individual cases.

91
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,451
This is not just about
an individual lawyer

92
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:30,329
who's spoken to our undercover
investigator and provided suggestions.

93
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:33,208
It's not just about
a particular senior politician

94
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,861
who's been caught up in a scandal.

95
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,941
This is about how a system works,

96
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:43,908
that entrenches corruption,
tax evasion, poverty and instability.

97
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:45,747
And in order to tackle this,

98
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,442
we need to change the game.

99
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,988
We need to change the rules of the game

100
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,004
to make this sort of behavior harder.

101
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,972
This may seem like doom and gloom,

102
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,917
like there's nothing we can do about it,

103
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,571
like nothing has ever changed,

104
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:01,931
like there will always be rich
and powerful individuals.

105
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,402
But as a natural optimist,

106
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,904
I do see that we are starting
to get some change.

107
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,803
Over the last couple of years,

108
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,495
we've seen a real push towards
greater transparency

109
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,353
when it comes to company ownership.

110
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,092
This issue was put on the political agenda

111
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,610
by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron

112
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:25,394
at a big G8 Summit that was held
in Northern Ireland in 2013.

113
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:30,222
And since then, the European Union
is going to be creating

114
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,403
central registers at a national level

115
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,834
of who really owns and controls
companies across Europe.

116
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:40,537
One of the things that is sad is that,
actually, the US is lagging behind.

117
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,658
There's bipartisan legislation
that had been introduced

118
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:45,585
in the House and the Senate,

119
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,766
but it isn't making as much progress
as we'd like to see.

120
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,877
So we'd really want to see
the Panama leaks,

121
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:55,695
this huge peek into the offshore world,

122
00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:00,771
be used as a way of opening up
in the US and around the world.

123
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:05,585
For us at Global Witness,
this is a moment for change.

124
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,698
We need ordinary people to get angry

125
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,975
at the way in which people
can hide their identity

126
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,912
behind secret companies.

127
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,523
We need business leaders
to stand up and say,

128
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,831
"Secrecy like this is not
good for business."

129
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,235
We need political leaders
to recognize the problem,

130
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,266
and to commit to changing the law
to open up this sort of secrecy.

131
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,918
Together, we can end the secrecy

132
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,999
that is currently allowing tax evasion,

133
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:41,214
corruption, money laundering to flourish.
