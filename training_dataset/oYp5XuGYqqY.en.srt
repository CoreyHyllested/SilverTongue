0
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:14,901
I love a great mystery,

1
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:19,313
and I'm fascinated by the greatest
unsolved mystery in science,

2
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,271
perhaps because it's personal.

3
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:23,539
It's about who we are,

4
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,656
and I can't help but be curious.

5
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:28,275
The mystery is this:

6
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,710
What is the relationship
between your brain

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,221
and your conscious experiences,

8
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,891
such as your experience
of the taste of chocolate

9
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:37,665
or the feeling of velvet?

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,389
Now, this mystery is not new.

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,598
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,

12
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:49,892
"How it is that anything so remarkable
as a state of consciousness comes about

13
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:53,259
as the result of irritating nervous tissue

14
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,325
is just as unaccountable

15
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:59,378
as the appearance of the genie
when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."

16
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:03,545
Now, Huxley knew that brain activity

17
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:06,819
and conscious experiences are correlated,

18
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,978
but he didn't know why.

19
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:12,299
To the science of his day,
it was a mystery.

20
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,435
In the years since Huxley,

21
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:17,801
science has learned a lot
about brain activity,

22
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,822
but the relationship
between brain activity

23
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:22,910
and conscious experiences
is still a mystery.

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,555
Why? Why have we made so little progress?

25
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:31,414
Well, some experts think
that we can't solve this problem

26
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:35,213
because we lack the necessary
concepts and intelligence.

27
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:39,952
We don't expect monkeys to solve
problems in quantum mechanics,

28
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:44,117
and as it happens, we can't expect
our species to solve this problem either.

29
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:47,661
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.

30
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,703
I think we've simply
made a false assumption.

31
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:54,209
Once we fix it, we just
might solve this problem.

32
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,626
Today, I'd like tell you
what that assumption is,

33
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:59,384
why it's false, and how to fix it.

34
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,568
Let's begin with a question:

35
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:04,866
Do we see reality as it is?

36
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,561
I open my eyes

37
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,498
and I have an experience that I describe
as a red tomato a meter away.

38
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,849
As a result, I come to believe
that in reality,

39
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,491
there's a red tomato a meter away.

40
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,615
I then close my eyes, and my experience
changes to a gray field,

41
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:29,591
but is it still the case that in reality,
there's a red tomato a meter away?

42
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,913
I think so, but could I be wrong?

43
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:38,511
Could I be misinterpreting
the nature of my perceptions?

44
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,551
We have misinterpreted
our perceptions before.

45
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:46,010
We used to think the Earth is flat,
because it looks that way.

46
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,586
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.

47
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,598
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of the Universe,

48
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,506
again because it looks that way.

49
00:02:56,406 --> 00:03:01,312
Copernicus and Galileo discovered,
again, that we were wrong.

50
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:05,400
Galileo then wondered if we might
be misinterpreting our experiences

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,908
in other ways.

52
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:11,917
He wrote: "I think that tastes,
odors, colors, and so on

53
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,921
reside in consciousness.

54
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:20,043
Hence if the living creature were removed,
all these qualities would be annihilated."

55
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,794
Now, that's a stunning claim.

56
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:24,995
Could Galileo be right?

57
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:29,593
Could we really be misinterpreting
our experiences that badly?

58
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,154
What does modern science
have to say about this?

59
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:37,928
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that about a third of the brain's cortex

60
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:39,786
is engaged in vision.

61
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,292
When you simply open your eyes
and look about this room,

62
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,564
billions of neurons
and trillions of synapses are engaged.

63
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,172
Now, this is a bit surprising,

64
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:51,813
because to the extent that
we think about vision at all,

65
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:54,650
we think of it as like a camera.

66
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,590
It just takes a picture
of objective reality as it is.

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,290
Now, there is a part of vision
that's like a camera:

68
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,929
the eye has a lens that focuses
an image on the back of the eye

69
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:10,319
where there are 130 million
photoreceptors,

70
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,219
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

71
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,702
But that doesn't explain
the billions of neurons

72
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:21,324
and trillions of synapses
that are engaged in vision.

73
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:23,623
What are these neurons up to?

74
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:27,830
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that they are creating, in real time,

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,160
all the shapes, objects, colors,
and motions that we see.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,651
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot
of this room the way it is,

77
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,226
but in fact, we're constructing
everything that we see.

78
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,407
We don't construct
the whole world at once.

79
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,172
We construct what we need in the moment.

80
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,909
Now, there are many demonstrations
that are quite compelling

81
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,720
that we construct what we see.

82
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,763
I'll just show you two.

83
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:58,529
In this example, you see some red discs
with bits cut out of them,

84
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,470
but if I just rotate
the disks a little bit,

85
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,207
suddenly, you see a 3D cube
pop out of the screen.

86
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:09,040
Now, the screen of course is flat,

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,640
so the three-dimensional cube
that you're experiencing

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,617
must be your construction.

89
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,310
In this next example,

90
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,534
you see glowing blue bars
with pretty sharp edges

91
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:24,718
moving across a field of dots.

92
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,845
In fact, no dots move.

93
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:33,466
All I'm doing from frame to frame
is changing the colors of dots

94
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,927
from blue to black or black to blue.

95
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,761
But when I do this quickly,

96
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:41,476
your visual system creates
the glowing blue bars

97
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:44,147
with the sharp edges and the motion.

98
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,817
There are many more examples,
but these are just two

99
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:49,580
that you construct what you see.

100
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,955
But neuroscientists go further.

101
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:58,496
They say that we reconstruct reality.

102
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:02,722
So, when I have an experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

103
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:06,855
that experience is actually
an accurate reconstruction

104
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,970
of the properties of a real red tomato

105
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,265
that would exist
even if I weren't looking.

106
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,816
Now, why would neuroscientists
say that we don't just construct,

107
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,696
we reconstruct?

108
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,227
Well, the standard argument given

109
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,781
is usually an evolutionary one.

110
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,380
Those of our ancestors
who saw more accurately

111
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,233
had a competitive advantage compared
to those who saw less accurately,

112
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,989
and therefore they were more likely
to pass on their genes.

113
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:38,380
We are the offspring of those
who saw more accurately,

114
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,149
and so we can be confident that,
in the normal case,

115
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:43,680
our perceptions are accurate.

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,375
You see this in the standard textbooks.

117
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,369
One textbook says, for example,

118
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:51,340
"Evolutionarily speaking,

119
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,383
vision is useful precisely
because it is so accurate."

120
00:06:55,383 --> 00:07:00,181
So the idea is that accurate perceptions
are fitter perceptions.

121
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:02,325
They give you a survival advantage.

122
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,240
Now, is this correct?

123
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,899
Is this the right interpretation
of evolutionary theory?

124
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,280
Well, let's first look at a couple
of examples in nature.

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,238
The Australian jewel beetle

126
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:16,349
is dimpled, glossy and brown.

127
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,694
The female is flightless.

128
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:22,711
The male flies, looking,
of course, for a hot female.

129
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:26,659
When he finds one, he alights and mates.

130
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,130
There's another species in the outback,

131
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,464
Homo sapiens.

132
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:33,531
The male of this species
has a massive brain

133
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:37,479
that he uses to hunt for cold beer.

134
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,168
(Laughter)

135
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,542
And when he finds one, he drains it,

136
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,932
and sometimes throws the bottle
into the outback.

137
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:49,180
Now, as it happens, these bottles
are dimpled, glossy,

138
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,320
and just the right shade of brown
to tickle the fancy of these beetles.

139
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:58,235
The males swarm all over
the bottles trying to mate.

140
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,369
They lose all interest
in the real females.

141
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:06,572
Classic case of the male
leaving the female for the bottle.

142
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,519
(Laughter) (Applause)

143
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,773
The species almost went extinct.

144
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:18,752
Australia had to change its bottles
to save its beetles.

145
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:21,752
(Laughter)

146
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,960
Now, the males had successfully
found females for thousands,

147
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,398
perhaps millions of years.

148
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:32,832
It looked like they saw reality
as it is, but apparently not.

149
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,689
Evolution had given them a hack.

150
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:40,425
A female is anything dimpled,
glossy and brown,

151
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:42,701
the bigger the better.

152
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,535
(Laughter)

153
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:49,375
Even when crawling all over the bottle,
the male couldn't discover his mistake.

154
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:53,590
Now, you might say, beetles, sure,
they're very simple creatures,

155
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,448
but surely not mammals.

156
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,165
Mammals don't rely on tricks.

157
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:04,178
Well, I won't dwell on this,
but you get the idea. (Laughter)

158
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,336
So this raises an important
technical question:

159
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:13,327
Does natural selection really favor
seeing reality as it is?

160
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:17,413
Fortunately, we don't have
to wave our hands and guess;

161
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,594
evolution is a mathematically
precise theory.

162
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,147
We can use the equations of evolution
to check this out.

163
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,300
We can have various organisms
in artificial worlds compete

164
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,253
and see which survive and which thrive,

165
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,806
which sensory systems are more fit.

166
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,891
A key notion in those
equations is fitness.

167
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,586
Consider this steak:

168
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,918
What does this steak do
for the fitness of an animal?

169
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:51,454
Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,
it enhances fitness.

170
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:56,773
For a well-fed lion looking to mate,
it doesn't enhance fitness.

171
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:01,924
And for a rabbit in any state,
it doesn't enhance fitness,

172
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:06,048
so fitness does depend
on reality as it is, yes,

173
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:10,236
but also on the organism,
its state and its action.

174
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,789
Fitness is not the same thing
as reality as it is,

175
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,272
and it's fitness,
and not reality as it is,

176
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:21,451
that figures centrally
in the equations of evolution.

177
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,642
So, in my lab,

178
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:28,417
we have run hundreds of thousands
of evolutionary game simulations

179
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,482
with lots of different
randomly chosen worlds

180
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:35,661
and organisms that compete
for resources in those worlds.

181
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:39,980
Some of the organisms
see all of the reality,

182
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,869
others see just part of the reality,

183
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,974
and some see none of the reality,

184
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,740
only fitness.

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,820
Who wins?

186
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,255
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but perception of reality goes extinct.

187
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,164
In almost every simulation,

188
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:58,346
organisms that see none of reality

189
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,436
but are just tuned to fitness

190
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:05,660
drive to extinction all the organisms
that perceive reality as it is.

191
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,250
So the bottom line is, evolution
does not favor veridical,

192
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,906
or accurate perceptions.

193
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,668
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.

194
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,688
Now, this is a bit stunning.

195
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:21,370
How can it be that not seeing
the world accurately

196
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,190
gives us a survival advantage?

197
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,303
That is a bit counterintuitive.

198
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,138
But remember the jewel beetle.

199
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:30,899
The jewel beetle survived
for thousands, perhaps millions of years,

200
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,593
using simple tricks and hacks.

201
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,770
What the equations
of evolution are telling us

202
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,413
is that all organisms, including us,
are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.

203
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,343
We do not see reality as it is.

204
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:48,615
We're shaped with tricks
and hacks that keep us alive.

205
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,635
Still,

206
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,702
we need some help with our intuitions.

207
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:57,485
How can not perceiving
reality as it is be useful?

208
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:01,154
Well, fortunately, we have
a very helpful metaphor:

209
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,986
the desktop interface on your computer.

210
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:08,119
Consider that blue icon
for a TED Talk that you're writing.

211
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:12,123
Now, the icon is blue and rectangular

212
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:14,504
and in the lower right corner
of the desktop.

213
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:19,510
Does that mean that the text file itself
in the computer is blue,

214
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,955
rectangular, and in the lower
right-hand corner of the computer?

215
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,278
Of course not.

216
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,987
Anyone who thought that misinterprets
the purpose of the interface.

217
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:32,755
It's not there to show you
the reality of the computer.

218
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:35,680
In fact, it's there to hide that reality.

219
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,555
You don't want to know about the diodes

220
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,805
and resistors and all
the megabytes of software.

221
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,936
If you had to deal with that,
you could never write your text file

222
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,411
or edit your photo.

223
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:49,128
So the idea is that evolution
has given us an interface

224
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:53,443
that hides reality and guides
adaptive behavior.

225
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:56,461
Space and time, as you
perceive them right now,

226
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,635
are your desktop.

227
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:03,372
Physical objects are simply icons
in that desktop.

228
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,413
There's an obvious objection.

229
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:10,361
Hoffman, if you think that train
coming down the track at 200 MPH

230
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,822
is just an icon of your desktop,

231
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,947
why don't you step in front of it?

232
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:17,240
And after you're gone,
and your theory with you,

233
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,554
we'll know that there's more
to that train than just an icon.

234
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,597
Well, I wouldn't step
in front of that train

235
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,153
for the same reason

236
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:28,448
that I wouldn't carelessly drag
that icon to the trash can:

237
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,629
not because I take the icon literally --

238
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,634
the file is not literally blue
or rectangular --

239
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:37,260
but I do take it seriously.

240
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,291
I could lose weeks of work.

241
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,845
Similarly, evolution has shaped us

242
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:46,281
with perceptual symbols
that are designed to keep us alive.

243
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,276
We'd better take them seriously.

244
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:51,481
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.

245
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,150
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.

246
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,726
They're designed to keep us safe,
and we should take them seriously.

247
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:01,417
That does not mean that we
should take them literally.

248
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,671
That's a logical error.

249
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,876
Another objection: There's
nothing really new here.

250
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:10,800
Physicists have told us for a long time
that the metal of that train looks solid

251
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,188
but really it's mostly empty space
with microscopic particles zipping around.

252
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,676
There's nothing new here.

253
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,880
Well, not exactly.

254
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,920
It's like saying, I know that
that blue icon on the desktop

255
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,219
is not the reality of the computer,

256
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:28,678
but if I pull out my trusty
magnifying glass and look really closely,

257
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,489
I see little pixels,

258
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,950
and that's the reality of the computer.

259
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,758
Well, not really -- you're still
on the desktop, and that's the point.

260
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,754
Those microscopic particles
are still in space and time:

261
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,145
they're still in the user interface.

262
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:45,907
So I'm saying something far more radical
than those physicists.

263
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,200
Finally, you might object,

264
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,759
look, we all see the train,

265
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,801
therefore none of us constructs the train.

266
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,891
But remember this example.

267
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:58,607
In this example, we all see a cube,

268
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,690
but the screen is flat,

269
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,427
so the cube that you see
is the cube that you construct.

270
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,779
We all see a cube

271
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,638
because we all, each one of us,
constructs the cube that we see.

272
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:14,698
The same is true of the train.

273
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,180
We all see a train because
we each see the train that we construct,

274
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,733
and the same is true
of all physical objects.

275
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:29,396
We're inclined to think that perception
is like a window on reality as it is.

276
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:34,400
The theory of evolution is telling us
that this is an incorrect interpretation

277
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,865
of our perceptions.

278
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:40,639
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop

279
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,936
that's designed to hide
the complexity of the real world

280
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,802
and guide adaptive behavior.

281
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:49,210
Space as you perceive it is your desktop.

282
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,236
Physical objects are just
the icons in that desktop.

283
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:57,126
We used to think that the Earth is flat
because it looks that way.

284
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,654
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of reality

285
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,378
because it looks that way.

286
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,520
We were wrong.

287
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,190
We had misinterpreted our perceptions.

288
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,319
Now we believe that spacetime and objects

289
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,933
are the nature of reality as it is.

290
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:17,377
The theory of evolution is telling us
that once again, we're wrong.

291
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:22,416
We're misinterpreting the content
of our perceptual experiences.

292
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,947
There's something that exists
when you don't look,

293
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:28,350
but it's not spacetime
and physical objects.

294
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,378
It's as hard for us to let go
of spacetime and objects

295
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:34,861
as it is for the jewel beetle
to let go of its bottle.

296
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:39,279
Why? Because we're blind
to our own blindnesses.

297
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,756
But we have an advantage
over the jewel beetle:

298
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,544
our science and technology.

299
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:46,935
By peering through the lens of a telescope

300
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:51,571
we discovered that the Earth
is not the unmoving center of reality,

301
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:54,449
and by peering through the lens
of the theory of evolution

302
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,771
we discovered that spacetime and objects

303
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:59,139
are not the nature of reality.

304
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,424
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

305
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:06,361
I am interacting with reality,

306
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:11,571
but that reality is not a red tomato
and is nothing like a red tomato.

307
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,972
Similarly, when I have an experience
that I describe as a lion or a steak,

308
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,820
I'm interacting with reality,

309
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,978
but that reality is not a lion or a steak.

310
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,998
And here's the kicker:

311
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:28,688
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a brain, or neurons,

312
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,778
I am interacting with reality,

313
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:34,307
but that reality is not a brain or neurons

314
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:37,805
and is nothing like a brain or neurons.

315
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:42,584
And that reality, whatever it is,

316
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:46,195
is the real source of cause and effect

317
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:50,227
in the world -- not brains, not neurons.

318
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:52,827
Brains and neurons
have no causal powers.

319
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:55,428
They cause none of our
perceptual experiences,

320
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,216
and none of our behavior.

321
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:02,592
Brains and neurons are a species-specific
set of symbols, a hack.

322
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:05,273
What does this mean
for the mystery of consciousness?

323
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:09,916
Well, it opens up new possibilities.

324
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,611
For instance,

325
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:18,590
perhaps reality is some vast machine
that causes our conscious experiences.

326
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,260
I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.

327
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,609
Perhaps reality is some vast,
interacting network of conscious agents,

328
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:33,182
simple and complex, that cause
each other's conscious experiences.

329
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:36,432
Actually, this isn't as crazy
an idea as it seems,

330
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,052
and I'm currently exploring it.

331
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,658
But here's the point:

332
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:43,979
Once we let go of our massively intuitive

333
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:47,903
but massively false assumption
about the nature of reality,

334
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:52,291
it opens up new ways to think
about life's greatest mystery.

335
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:57,860
I bet that reality will end up
turning out to be more fascinating

336
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,834
and unexpected than we've ever imagined.

337
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:06,222
The theory of evolution presents us
with the ultimate dare:

338
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:11,364
Dare to recognize that perception
is not about seeing truth,

339
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:15,460
it's about having kids.

340
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,200
And by the way, even this TED
is just in your head.

341
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,244
Thank you very much.

342
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,632

343
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:36,221
Chris Anderson: If that's
really you there, thank you.

344
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:39,152
So there's so much from this.

345
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:42,421
I mean, first of all, some people
may just be profoundly depressed

346
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:47,970
at the thought that,
if evolution does not favor reality,

347
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,300
I mean, doesn't that to some extent
undermine all our endeavors here,

348
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,984
all our ability to think
that we can think the truth,

349
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,490
possibly even including
your own theory, if you go there?

350
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,944
Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not
stop us from a successful science.

351
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,756
What we have is one theory
that turned out to be false,

352
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:09,215
that perception is like reality
and reality is like our perceptions.

353
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,900
That theory turns out to be false.

354
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,318
Okay, throw that theory away.

355
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:15,572
That doesn't stop us from now postulating
all sorts of other theories

356
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:16,930
about the nature of reality,

357
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,535
so it's actually progress to recognize
that one of our theories was false.

358
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:23,193
So science continues as normal.
There's no problem here.

359
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:25,794
CA: So you think it's possible
-- (Laughter) --

360
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:29,904
This is cool, but what you're saying
I think is it's possible that evolution

361
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,551
can still get you to reason.

362
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,864
DH: Yes. Now that's a very,
very good point.

363
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:39,391
The evolutionary game simulations that I
showed were specifically about perception,

364
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:41,969
and they do show that our perceptions
have been shaped

365
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:43,849
not to show us reality as it is,

366
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,122
but that does not mean the same thing
about our logic or mathematics.

367
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,744
We haven't done these simulations,
but my bet is that we'll find

368
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:55,366
that there are some selection pressures
for our logic and our mathematics

369
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,572
to be at least in the direction of truth.

370
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:00,219
I mean, if you're like me,
math and logic is not easy.

371
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,570
We don't get it all right, but at least
the selection pressures are not

372
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,908
uniformly away from true math and logic.

373
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,228
So I think that we'll find that we have
to look at each cognitive faculty

374
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,852
one at a time and see
what evolution does to it.

375
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:15,613
What's true about perception may not
be true about math and logic.

376
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:19,607
CA: I mean, really what you're proposing
is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley

377
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,998
interpretation of the world:

378
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:24,947
consciousness causes matter,
not the other way around.

379
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:27,339
DH: Well, it's slightly
different than Berkeley.

380
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:30,701
Berkeley thought that, he was a deist,
and he thought that the ultimate

381
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,740
nature of reality is God
and so forth,

382
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,850
and I don't need to go
where Berkeley's going,

383
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,545
so it's quite a bit
different from Berkeley.

384
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:43,235
I call this conscious realism.
It's actually a very different approach.

385
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,825
CA: Don, I could literally talk with you
for hours, and I hope to do that.

386
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:49,298
Thanks so much for that.
DH: Thank you. (Applause)
