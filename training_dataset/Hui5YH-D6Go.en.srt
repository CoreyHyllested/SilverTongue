0
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to speak

1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
about a tiny, little idea.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And this is about shifting baseline.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And because the idea can be explained in one minute,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I will tell you three stories before

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to fill in the time.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And the first story

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And he was here, as you well know, in '35.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And you'd think he was chasing finches,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but he wasn't.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He was actually collecting fish.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And he described one of them

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
as very "common."

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This was the sailfin grouper.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A big fishery was run on it

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
until the '80s.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now this story,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we have heard it lots of times

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on Galapagos and other places,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so there is nothing particular about it.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We still think it is pristine.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The brochures still say

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
it is untouched.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So what happens here?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The second story, also to illustrate another concept,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is called shifting waistline.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
(Laughter)

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Because I was there in '71,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
studying a lagoon in West Africa.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was there because I grew up in Europe

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and I wanted later to work in Africa.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I thought I could blend in.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I got a big sunburn,

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and I was convinced that I was really not from there.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This was my first sunburn.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And the lagoon

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
was surrounded by palm trees,

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as you can see, and a few mangrove.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And it had tilapia

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
about 20 centimeters,

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And the fisheries for this tilapia

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
sustained lots of fish and they had a good time

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and they earned more than average

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in Ghana.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I went there 27 years later,

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the fish had shrunk to half of their size.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They were maturing at five centimeters.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They had been pushed genetically.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There were still fishes.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They were still kind of happy.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And the fish also were happy to be there.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So nothing has changed,

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but everything has changed.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My third little story

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is that I was an accomplice

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
in the introduction of trawling

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in Southeast Asia.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Europe did lots of development projects.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Fish development

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
meant imposing on countries

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that had already 100,000 fishers

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to impose on them industrial fishing.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And this boat, quite ugly,

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
is called the Mutiara 4.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I went sailing on it,

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and we did surveys

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
throughout the southern South China sea

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and especially the Java Sea.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And what we caught,

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we didn't have words for it.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What we caught, I know now,

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is the bottom of the sea.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And 90 percent of our catch

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
were sponges,

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
other animals that are fixed on the bottom.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And actually most of the fish,

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
they are a little spot on the debris,

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and then was thrown down.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And these pictures are extraordinary

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because this transition is very rapid.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Within a year, you do a survey

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and then commercial fishing begins.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The bottom is transformed

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
into a muddy mess.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is a dead turtle.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And one time we caught a live one.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was not drowned yet.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This mountain of debris

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
is actually collected by fishers

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
every time they go

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
into an area that's never been fished.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But it's not documented.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We transform the world,

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but we don't remember it.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We adjust our baseline

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to the new level,

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and we don't recall what was there.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you generalize this,

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
something like this happens.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have on the y axis some good thing:

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
biodiversity, numbers of orca,

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the greenness of your country, the water supply.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And over time it changes --

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it changes

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
because people do things, or naturally.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Every generation

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
will use the images

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
as a standard

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and will extrapolate forward.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And the difference then,

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
they perceive as a loss.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can have a succession of changes.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At the end you want to sustain

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
miserable leftovers.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We want to sustain things that are gone

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
or things that are not the way they were.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now one should think

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
this problem affected people

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
certainly when in predatory societies,

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
they killed animals

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and they didn't know they had done so

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
after a few generations.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because, obviously,

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
an animal that is very abundant,

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
before it gets extinct,

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it becomes rare.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So you don't lose abundant animals.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You always lose rare animals.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And therefore they're not perceived

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
as a big loss.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Over time,

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
we concentrate on large animals,

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and in a sea that means the big fish.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They become rarer because we fish them.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Over time we have a few fish left

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and we think this is the baseline.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And the question is,

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
why do people accept this?

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well because they don't know that it was different.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And in fact, lots of people, scientists,

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
will contest that it was really different.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And they will contest this

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
because the evidence

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
presented in an earlier mode

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is not in the way

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
they would like the evidence presented.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For example,

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the anecdote that some present,

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
as Captain so-and-so

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
observed lots of fish in this area

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
cannot be used

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because it's not "scientific."

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So you have a situation

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
where people don't know the past,

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
even though we live in literate societies,

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
because they don't trust

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the sources of the past.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And hence, the enormous role

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that a marine protected area can play.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because with marine protected areas,

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we actually recreate the past.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because the baseline has shifted

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and is extremely low.

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That is for people

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
who can see a marine protected area

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and who can benefit

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
from the insight that it provides,

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
which enables them to reset their baseline.

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How about the people who can't do that

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
because they have no access --

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the people in the Midwest for example?

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There I think

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that the arts and film

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
can perhaps fill the gap,

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and simulation.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
500 years ago.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are like "Avatar."

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
(Laughter)

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And if you think about "Avatar,"

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
if you think of why people were so touched by it --

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
never mind the Pocahontas story --

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
why so touched by the imagery?

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because it evokes something

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that in a sense has been lost.

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And so my recommendation,

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
it's the only one I will provide,

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you very much.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
(Applause)
