0
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,275
I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,

1
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,450
81's platoon,

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,479
out in Camp Pendleton, California.

3
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:19,655
Oorah!

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,831
Audience: Oorah!

5
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:21,856
(Laughter)

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,848
I joined a few months after September 11,

7
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:26,891
feeling like I think most people
in the country did at the time,

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,200
filled with a sense
of patriotism and retribution

9
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:31,866
and the desire to do something --

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,635
that, coupled with that fact
that I wasn't doing anything.

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,905
I was 17, just graduated
from high school that past summer,

12
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,631
living in the back room
of my parents' house paying rent,

13
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,244
in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana,

14
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,426
called Mishawaka.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,028
I can spell that later
for people who are interested --

16
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,056
(Laughter)

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,940
Mishawaka is many good things
but cultural hub of the world it is not,

18
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,860
so my only exposure to theater and film

19
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:56,013
was limited to the plays
I did in high school

20
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,265
and Blockbuster Video,
may she rest in peace.

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,461
(Laughter)

22
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:01,132
I was serious enough about acting

23
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:04,464
that I auditioned for Juilliard
when I was a senior in high school,

24
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:05,639
didn't get in,

25
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:08,389
determined college wasn't for me
and applied nowhere else,

26
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:09,706
which was a genius move.

27
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,181
I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey

28
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,840
that I always heard stories about,

29
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:17,165
of actors moving to LA
with, like, seven dollars

30
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,132
and finding work and successful careers.

31
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:22,512
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
before my car broke down.

32
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,263
I spent all my money repairing it,

33
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:25,932
finally made it to Santa Monica --

34
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,234
not even LA --

35
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:29,917
stayed for 48 hours wandering
the beach, basically,

36
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,227
got in my car, drove home,

37
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,957
thus ending my acting career, so --

38
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:34,259
(Laughter)

39
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,171
Seventeen, Mishawaka ...

40
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:40,023
parents' house, paying rent,
selling vacuums ...

41
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:41,602
telemarketing,

42
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,809
cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds.

43
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,125
This was my world
going into September, 2001.

44
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,300
So after the 11th,

45
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,526
and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,

46
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,901
and just being pissed off
in general -- at myself,

47
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,321
my parents, the government;

48
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,798
not having confidence,
not having a respectable job,

49
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,924
my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back --

50
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:01,921
I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.

51
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:04,983
It's one of the things I'm most proud
of having done in my life.

52
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,173
Firing weapons was cool,

53
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:08,632
driving and detonating
expensive things was great.

54
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,764
But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most

55
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,429
for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,

56
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:14,614
which was the people:

57
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:18,218
these weird dudes --
a motley crew of characters

58
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,624
from a cross section
of the United States --

59
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:22,979
that on the surface I had
nothing in common with.

60
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:24,611
And over time,

61
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,461
all the political and personal bravado

62
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,362
that led me to the military dissolved,

63
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:31,368
and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends.

64
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,680
And then, a few years into my service

65
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,783
and months away from deploying to Iraq,

66
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,672
I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident,

67
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,338
and had to be medically separated.

68
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:43,295
Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,382
but being told I wasn't getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan

70
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,849
was very devastating for me.

71
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:51,114
I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher

72
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,008
and my entire platoon is waiting
outside to see if I was OK.

73
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:56,466
And then, suddenly,
I was a civilian again.

74
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,695
I knew I wanted to give
acting another shot,

75
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,523
because -- again, this is me --

76
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,266
I thought all civilian problems
are small compared to the military.

77
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,047
I mean, what can you really
bitch about now, you know?

78
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,243
"It's hot.

79
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,904
Someone should turn
on the air conditioner."

80
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,728
"This coffee line is too long."

81
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,307
I was a Marine,

82
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:15,482
I knew how to survive.

83
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,444
I'd go to New York and become an actor.

84
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,729
If things didn't work out,

85
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:21,737
I'd live in Central Park
and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.

86
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,762
(Laughter)

87
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,476
I re-auditioned for Juilliard
and this time I was lucky,

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,651
I got in.

89
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:29,216
But I was surprised
by how complex the transition was

90
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,541
from military to civilian.

91
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:34,040
And I was relatively healthy; I can't
imagine going through that process

92
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,926
on top of a mental or physical injury.

93
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,541
But regardless, it was difficult.

94
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,735
In part, because I was in acting school --

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,296
I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class,

96
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,588
throwing imaginary balls of energy
at the back of the room,

97
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,175
doing acting exercises
where I gave birth to myself --

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,200
(Laughter)

99
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:52,958
while my friends were serving
without me overseas.

100
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,591
But also, because I didn't
know how to apply the things

101
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,968
I learned in the military
to a civilian context.

102
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,151
I mean that both practically
and emotionally.

103
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:01,744
Practically, I had to get a job.

104
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,500
And I was an Infantry Marine,

105
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:06,080
where you're shooting machine guns
and firing mortars.

106
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:09,651
There's not a lot of places you can
put those skills in the civilian world.

107
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:10,676
(Laughter)

108
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,722
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

109
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,064
In the military, everything has meaning.

110
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,341
Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition

111
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,693
or has a practical purpose.

112
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,070
You can't smoke in the field

113
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,445
because you don't want
to give away your position.

114
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,764
You don't touch your face --
you have to maintain

115
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,670
a personal level of health and hygiene.

116
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:28,520
You face this way when "Colors" plays,

117
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,734
out of respect for people
who went before you.

118
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:32,898
Walk this way, talk this way
because of this.

119
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,802
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.

120
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:37,319
How diligently you followed
those rules spoke volumes

121
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,978
about the kind of Marine you were.

122
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,030
Your rank said something
about your history

123
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,538
and the respect you had earned.

124
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,394
In the civilian world there's no rank.

125
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,857
Here you're just another body,

126
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,088
and I felt like I constantly had
to prove my worth all over again.

127
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:52,112
And the respect civilians were giving me
while I was in uniform

128
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:53,762
didn't exist when I was out of it.

129
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,539
There didn't seem to be a ...

130
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,763
a sense of community,

131
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,453
whereas in the military,
I felt this sense of community.

132
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,206
How often in the civilian world

133
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,982
are you put in a life-or-death situation
with your closest friends

134
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:08,312
and they constantly demonstrate
that they're not going to abandon you?

135
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,389
And meanwhile, at acting school ...

136
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:12,871
(Laughter)

137
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,569
I was really, for the first time,

138
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:16,878
discovering playwrights
and characters and plays

139
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,865
that had nothing to do with the military,

140
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,244
but were somehow describing
my military experience

141
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:23,815
in a way that before
to me was indescribable.

142
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,230
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive

143
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:29,457
as I was able to put words
to feelings for the first time

144
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,600
and realizing what
a valuable tool that was.

145
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,104
And when I was reflecting
on my time in the military,

146
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,539
I wasn't first thinking
on the stereotypical drills

147
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:38,015
and discipline and pain of it;

148
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,253
but rather, the small,
intimate human moments,

149
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,610
moments of great feeling:

150
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,259
friends going AWOL
because they missed their families,

151
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,518
friends getting divorced,

152
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,540
grieving together, celebrating together,

153
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,499
all within the backdrop of the military.

154
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,805
I saw my friends battling
these circumstances,

155
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,860
and I watched the anxiety
it produced in them and me,

156
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,470
not being able to express
our feelings about it.

157
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:01,074
The military and theater communities
are actually very similar.

158
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,823
You have a group of people
trying to accomplish a mission

159
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,910
greater than themselves;
it's not about you.

160
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,902
You have a role, you have to know
your role within that team.

161
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:11,085
Every team has a leader or director;

162
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,659
sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not.

163
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,287
You're forced to be intimate
with complete strangers

164
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,596
in a short amount of time;

165
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,667
the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.

166
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,615
I thought, how great would it be
to create a space

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,966
that combined these two seemingly
dissimilar communities,

168
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,225
that brought entertainment
to a group of people

169
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,344
that, considering their occupation,

170
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:32,812
could handle something
a bit more thought-provoking

171
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:34,669
than the typical mandatory-fun events

172
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,754
that I remember being
"volun-told" to go to in the military --

173
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:38,780
(Laughter)

174
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:41,082
all well-intended but slightly
offensive events,

175
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:43,757
like "Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"

176
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,957
where you answer a question
about pop culture,

177
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,874
and if you get it right you win a date,

178
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:50,244
which was a chaperoned walk
around the parade deck

179
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:52,659
with this already married,
pregnant cheerleader --

180
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:53,850
(Laughter)

181
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:56,254
Nothing against cheerleaders,
I love cheerleaders.

182
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:59,390
The point is more, how great would it
be to have theater presented

183
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,638
through characters that were accessible
without being condescending.

184
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,567
So we started this nonprofit
called Arts in the Armed Forces,

185
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,246
where we tried to do that,

186
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,188
tried to join these two seemingly
dissimilar communities.

187
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:14,027
We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays

188
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:17,725
that are diverse in age and race
like a military audience is,

189
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,098
grab a group of incredible
theater-trained actors,

190
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:21,975
arm them with incredible material,

191
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,219
keep production value
as minimal as possible --

192
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,279
no sets, no costumes,
no lights, just reading it --

193
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,782
to throw all the emphasis on the language

194
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:32,521
and to show that theater can
be created at any setting.

195
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:33,725
It's a powerful thing,

196
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,635
getting in a room with complete strangers

197
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,307
and reminding ourselves of our humanity,

198
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,728
and that self-expression
is just as valuable a tool

199
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,109
as a rifle on your shoulder.

200
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,138
And for an organization like the military,

201
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:48,089
that prides itself on having
acronyms for acronyms,

202
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,536
you can get lost in the sauce

203
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,242
when it comes to explaining
a collective experience.

204
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,110
And I can think of no better community

205
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:56,205
to arm with a new means of self-expression

206
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,251
than those protecting our country.

207
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,755
We've gone all over
the United States and the world,

208
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,460
from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,

209
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,930
to Camp Pendleton,
to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,

210
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,663
to USAG Bavaria,

211
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,727
on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.

212
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,823
And for the performing artists we bring,

213
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,515
it's a window into a culture

214
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,699
they otherwise would not
have had exposure to.

215
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:17,742
And for the military, it's the exact same.

216
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,753
And in doing this for the past six years,

217
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:22,008
I'm always reminded
that acting is many things.

218
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:25,237
It's a craft, it's a political act,
it's a business, it's --

219
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,013
whatever adjective
is most applicable to you.

220
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,476
But it's also a service.

221
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,024
I didn't get to finish mine,

222
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,680
so whenever I get to be of service

223
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:35,981
to this ultimate service industry,
the military, for me, again --

224
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:38,052
there's not many things better than that.

225
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,404
Thank you.

226
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:44,016
(Applause)

227
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,964
We're going to be doing a piece
from Marco Ramirez,

228
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:49,682
called "I am not Batman."

229
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:52,734
An incredible actor
and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,

230
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:53,933
is going to be reading,

231
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:56,441
and Matt Johnson,
who I just met a couple hours ago.

232
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,616
They're doing it together
for the first time,

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,878
so we'll see how it goes.

234
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:01,821
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.

235
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,999
(Applause)

236
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,636
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night

237
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,970
and the sky is glowing
like mad, radioactive red.

238
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:19,116
And if you squint,
you can maybe see the moon

239
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,006
through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
and airplane exhaust

240
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,321
that covers the whole city,

241
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,643
like a mosquito net
that won't let the angels in.

242
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,707
(Drum beat)

243
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,217
And if you look up high enough,

244
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:31,678
you can see me standing
on the edge of an 87-story building.

245
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:35,129
And up there, a place for gargoyles
and broken clock towers

246
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:38,129
that have stayed still and dead
for maybe like 100 years,

247
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:39,664
up there is me.

248
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,718
(Beat)

249
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:42,326
And I'm frickin' Batman.

250
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,389
(Beat)

251
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,578
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs

252
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,997
and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.

253
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,715
And all it takes is a broom closet

254
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,683
or a back room or a fire escape,

255
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,698
and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.

256
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,618
And my navy blue polo shirt,

257
00:09:56,642 --> 00:10:00,119
the one that looks kinda good on me
but has that hole on it near the butt

258
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:03,167
from when it got snagged
on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's

259
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,883
but it isn't even a big deal
because I tuck that part in

260
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,126
and it's, like, all good.

261
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,067
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!

262
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,098
And I get like, like ... transformational.

263
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,122
(Beat)

264
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,769
And nobody pulls out a belt
and whips Batman for talkin' back.

265
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:17,810
(Beat)

266
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,254
Or for not talkin' back.

267
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,602
And nobody calls Batman simple

268
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:23,175
or stupid

269
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,396
or skinny.

270
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:28,003
And nobody fires Batman's brother
from the Eastern Taxi Company

271
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,059
'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.

272
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,972
'Cause they got nothing but respect.

273
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,131
And not like afraid-respect,

274
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,534
just, like, respect-respect.

275
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:37,559
(Laughter)

276
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,090
'Cause nobody's afraid of you.

277
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,248
'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.

278
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:42,273
(Beat)

279
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:43,851
Ever.
(Double beat)

280
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,312
'Cause all Batman really wants
to do is save people

281
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:48,083
and maybe pay abuela's bills one day

282
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,258
and die happy.

283
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,478
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.

284
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:52,513
(Laughter)

285
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:53,874
Oh -- and kill the Joker.

286
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,358
(Drum roll)

287
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:58,040
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.

288
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:00,257
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

289
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,463
like a eagle

290
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,657
or like a --

291
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,390
no, yeah, like a eagle.

292
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,415
(Laughter)

293
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,257
And my cape is flapping in the wind
cause it's frickin' long

294
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,695
and my pointy ears are on,

295
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,549
and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too,

296
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,049
and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
all in my chest so no one can hurt me.

297
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,787
And nobody -- nobody! --

298
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,850
is gonna come between Batman ...

299
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,053
and justice.

300
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,879
(Drums)
(Laughter)

301
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,411
From where I am,

302
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,022
I can hear everything.

303
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:27,212
(Silence)

304
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,396
Somewhere in the city,

305
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,636
there's a old lady picking
Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can

306
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,510
and she's putting a piece
of sesame chicken someone spit out

307
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,845
into her own mouth.

308
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:39,178
And somewhere there's a doctor
with a wack haircut in a black lab coat

309
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,060
trying to find a cure for the diseases

310
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,042
that are gonna make us
all extinct for real one day.

311
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,426
And somewhere there's a man,

312
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,847
a man in a janitor's uniform,

313
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,804
stumbling home drunk and dizzy

314
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:52,580
after spending half his paycheck
on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,

315
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,548
and the other half on a four-hour visit
to some lady's house

316
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:57,997
on a street where the lights
have all been shot out

317
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:01,054
by people who'd rather do
what they do in this city in the dark.

318
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,004
And half a block away from janitor man,

319
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:05,942
there's a group of good-for-nothings
who don't know no better,

320
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,490
waiting for janitor man
with rusted bicycle chains

321
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,183
and imitation Louisville Sluggers,

322
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,989
and if they don't find a cent on him,

323
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:13,164
which they won't,

324
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:16,546
they'll just pound at him till the muscles
in their arms start burning,

325
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,643
till there's no more teeth to crack out.

326
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,166
But they don't count on me.

327
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,911
They don't count on no Dark Knight,

328
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,929
with a stomach full of grocery-store
brand macaroni and cheese

329
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,542
and cut-up Vienna sausages.

330
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:28,567
(Laughter)

331
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:31,147
'Cause they'd rather believe
I don't exist.

332
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:35,506
And from 87 stories up, I can hear
one of the good-for-nothings say,

333
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,831
"Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that,

334
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,598
just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"

335
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:43,175
And I see janitor man mumble something
in drunk language and turn pale,

336
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:44,376
and from 87 stories up,

337
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,508
I can hear his stomach trying
to hurl its way out his Dickies.

338
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,413
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast

339
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:52,452
and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"

340
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,931
And I throw a batarang
at the one naked lightbulb.

341
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:55,994
(Cymbal)

342
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,146
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!

343
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,761
Who just turned out the lights?"

344
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,786
(Laughter)

345
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,479
"What's that over there?"
"What?"

346
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,096
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"

347
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,286
"Did anybody hear that?"

348
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,150
"Hear what? There ain't nothing.
No, really -- there ain't no bat!"

349
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:10,401
But then ...

350
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,904
one out of the three good-for-nothings
gets it to the head -- pow!

351
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,785
And number two swings blindly
into the dark cape before him,

352
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,618
but before his fist hits anything,

353
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,546
I grab a trash can lid and --

354
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,757
right in the gut!

355
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:23,896
And number one comes
back with the jump kick,

356
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,551
but I know judo karate, too,
so I'm like --

357
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:30,356
(Drums)

358
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,531
Twice!

359
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,556
(Drums)

360
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,805
(Laughter)

361
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,281
(Drums)

362
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,065
But before I can do any more damage,

363
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,288
suddenly we all hear a "click-click."

364
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,453
And suddenly everything gets quiet.

365
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,065
And the one good-for-nothing left standing

366
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,026
grips a handgun and aims it straight up,

367
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,631
like he's holding Jesus hostage,

368
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:51,540
like he's threatening maybe
to blow a hole in the moon.

369
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,836
And the good-for-nothing
who got it to the head,

370
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,128
who tried to jump-kick me,

371
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,645
and the other good-for-nothing
who got it in the gut,

372
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,550
is both scrambling back away
from the dark figure before 'em.

373
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,257
And the drunk man, the janitor man,

374
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,544
is huddled in a corner,
praying to Saint Anthony

375
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,684
'cause that's the only one
he could remember.

376
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,709
(Double beat)

377
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,885
And there's me:

378
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,680
eyes glowing white,

379
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,711
cape blowing softly in the wind.

380
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,736
(Beat)

381
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,257
Bulletproof chest heaving,

382
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,821
my heart beating right through it
in a Morse code for:

383
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:18,996
"Fuck with me

384
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,171
just once

385
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,346
come on

386
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,520
just try."

387
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,910
And the one good-for-nothing
left standing,

388
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,249
the one with the handgun --

389
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:27,424
yeah, he laughs.

390
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:28,630
And he lowers his arm.

391
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:29,964
And he points it at me

392
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,439
and gives the moon a break.

393
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,636
And he aims it right
between my pointy ears,

394
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,609
like goal posts and he's special teams.

395
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,113
And janitor man is still
calling Saint Anthony,

396
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,493
but he ain't pickin' up.

397
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,955
And for a second,

398
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:45,233
it seems like ...

399
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,765
maybe I'm gonna lose.

400
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,057
Nah!

401
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,097
(Drums)

402
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,306
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!

403
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,481
"Don't kill me, man!"

404
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:57,463
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!

405
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:01,470
Skin meets acid:
"Ahhhhhhh!"

406
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:02,732
And he's on the floor

407
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:03,954
and I'm standing over him

408
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:05,887
and I got the gun in my hands now

409
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,575
and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em
'cause I'm Batman.

410
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,777
And, asterisk:

411
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,359
Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
got iced by guns a long time ago.

412
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:14,598
But for just a second,

413
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,940
my eyes glow white,

414
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,123
and I hold this thing

415
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:19,130
for I could speak to the good-for-nothing

416
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:20,900
in a language he maybe understands.

417
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,471
Click-click!

418
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,508
(Beat)

419
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:26,097
And the good-for-nothings
become good-for-disappearing

420
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,816
into whatever toxic waste, chemical
sludge shithole they crawled out of.

421
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:32,760
And it's just me and janitor man.

422
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,025
And I pick him up,

423
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,182
and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
off his forehead.

424
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,642
And he begs me not to hurt him

425
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,196
and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar,

426
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,507
and I pull him to my face

427
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:45,611
and he's taller than me
but the cape helps,

428
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,028
so he listens when I look him
straight in the eyes.

429
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:49,773
And I say two words to him:

430
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,075
"Go home."

431
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,528
And he does,

432
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:57,020
checking behind his shoulder
every 10 feet.

433
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,633
And I swoosh from building
to building on his way there

434
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,061
'cause I know where he lives.

435
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,889
And I watch his hands tremble
as he pulls out his key chain

436
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:05,622
and opens the door to his building.

437
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:06,917
And I'm back in bed

438
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:09,213
before he even walks in
through the front door.

439
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,167
And I hear him turn on the faucet

440
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,447
and pour himself a glass
of warm tap water.

441
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,692
And he puts the glass back in the sink.

442
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,800
And I hear his footsteps.

443
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,685
And they get slower
as they get to my room.

444
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:24,883
And he creaks my door open,
like, mad-slow.

445
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,781
And he takes a step in,

446
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,161
which he never does.

447
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:30,677
(Beat)

448
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,797
And he's staring off into nowhere,

449
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:35,486
his face, the color
of sidewalks in summer.

450
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,091
And I act like I'm just waking up

451
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,524
and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"

452
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:42,723
And janitor man says nothing to me.

453
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,914
But I see in the dark,

454
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,311
I see his arms go limp

455
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,449
and his head turns back, like, towards me.

456
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,849
And he lifts it for I can see his face,

457
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:52,739
for I could see his eyes.

458
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,135
And his cheeks is drippin',
but not with sweat.

459
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,485
And he just stands there breathing,

460
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,941
like he remembers my eyes glowing white,

461
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,655
like he remembers my bulletproof chest,

462
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:05,456
like he remembers he's my pop.

463
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:12,531
And for a long time I don't say nothin'.

464
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,609
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.

465
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,061
And he ain't looking my way,

466
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,627
but I hear him mumble two words to me:

467
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:23,667
"I'm sorry."

468
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:29,596
And I lean over, and I open
my window just a crack.

469
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,382
If you look up high enough,

470
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,612
you could see me.

471
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,936
And from where I am --

472
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,912
(Cymbals)

473
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,442
I could hear everything.

474
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:52,500
(Applause)

475
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:53,761
Thank you.

476
00:17:53,801 --> 00:18:01,140
(Applause)
