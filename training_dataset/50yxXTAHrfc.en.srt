0
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,230
I opened a blind man's head.

1
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:21,837
I didn't make him think or reflect --
I cracked his head open, literally.

2
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,969
We were walking with him
holding onto my shoulder,

3
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,833
I miscalculated how much space
there was between us,

4
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,622
and I knocked him into a gate.

5
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:30,813
(Laughter)

6
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:32,806
Five stitches in his forehead.

7
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:36,936
At that moment, I felt like
the worst teacher in the world.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,068
I really didn't know how to apologize.

9
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:45,556
Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people
who takes things quite well.

10
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,752
And to this day, he says
that I was the coach

11
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:51,220
who left the most important
mark on his career.

12
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,417
(Laughter)

13
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,723
The truth is, when I started working
at the institute for the blind,

14
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:58,499
I was surprised by a lot of things.

15
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:02,450
A lot of the things they did,
I never imagined they could:

16
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:06,396
they swam, did exercise, played cards.

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,624
They drank mate, and could pour it

18
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,712
without burning themselves in the process.

19
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,529
But when I saw them playing soccer --

20
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:13,965
that was amazing.

21
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:18,547
They had a dirt field,
rusty goalposts and broken nets.

22
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,201
The blind who attended the institute
would play their games there,

23
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:24,800
just like I did at a field near my house.

24
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:26,916
But they played without being able to see.

25
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:31,015
The ball made a sound
so they could locate it.

26
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,050
They had a guide
behind the rival team's goal

27
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,078
to know where to kick the ball.

28
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,980
And they used eye masks.

29
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,240
There were guys
who could still see a little,

30
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:43,419
and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.

31
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:49,176
When I was more at ease with them,
I asked for a mask myself.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,846
I put it on and tried to play.

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,567
I had played soccer all my life.

34
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,318
This is where it got even more amazing:

35
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:59,162
within two seconds, I didn't know
where I was standing.

36
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:05,880
I had studied physical education
because I loved high performance.

37
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:08,119
I started working
at the institute by chance.

38
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:10,990
My other job was with the Argentinian
National Rowing Team,

39
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,669
and I felt that was my thing.

40
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,065
Here, everything was twice as hard.

41
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:19,540
I'll never forget the first day
I did the warm-up with the team.

42
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:21,276
I lined them up in front of me --

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,169
I used to do that with the rowing team --

44
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:27,448
and I said, "OK, everyone
bend down," going like this.

45
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,414
When I looked up, two guys were seated,

46
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,747
three were lying down
and others were squatting.

47
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,137
(Laughter)

48
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:36,523
How could I do here
the same things I was doing there?

49
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,290
It took me a while.

50
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:43,778
I started looking for tools
to learn from them,

51
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,370
from the teachers who worked with them.

52
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:51,040
I learned I couldn't explain a play
on a chalkboard like a coach does,

53
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,844
but I could use a plastic tray
and some bottle caps

54
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,237
so they could follow me by way of touch.

55
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,932
I also learned they could run on a track

56
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,979
if I ran with them, holding a rope.

57
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,823
So we started looking for volunteers
to help us run with them.

58
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,381
I was enjoying it,

59
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:13,056
and finding purpose and meaning
in what we were doing.

60
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:15,907
It was hard at first,
it was uncomfortable,

61
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:18,074
but I decided to overcome the discomfort.

62
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,520
And there came a time

63
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:22,308
when it became the most
fascinating job I'd ever had.

64
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,606
I think that's when I wondered:

65
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,854
Why couldn't we be
a high-performance team as well?

66
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,699
Of course, one thing was missing:

67
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,793
I needed to find out what they wanted,

68
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,396
the real protagonists of this story.

69
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:42,325
Three hours of training,
playing soccer on that field,

70
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,960
were not going to be enough.

71
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,119
We would have to train differently.

72
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,882
We started to train harder,
and the results were great;

73
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,195
they asked for more.

74
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,855
I came to understand
that they, too, wondered

75
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,787
why they couldn't do high-performance.

76
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:01,150
When we felt ready,
we knocked at CENARD's door.

77
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,914
CENARD is the National Center
for High-Performance Sports

78
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,282
here in Argentina.

79
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:07,723
It was hard to get them
to hear what we had to say.

80
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,203
But it was considerably more difficult

81
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:13,993
to get the other athletes training there
to consider us their equals.

82
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:16,598
In fact, they would let us use the field

83
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,835
only when no other teams were using it.

84
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,311
And we were known as "the blind ones."

85
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:24,269
Not everyone knew
exactly what we were doing there.

86
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:29,663
The 2006 World Championship
was a turning point in the team's history.

87
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,233
It was held in Buenos Aires
for the first time.

88
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:36,056
It was our chance to show everyone

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,003
what we had been doing all that time.

90
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,494
We made it to the finals.

91
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,741
We were growing as a team.

92
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,393
It was us against Brazil in the finals.

93
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,612
They were the best team in the tournament.

94
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,176
They won every game by a landslide.

95
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:56,803
Hardly anyone believed
we could win that game.

96
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,689
Hardly anyone -- except for us.

97
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,809
During pre-game meetings,

98
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,476
in the locker room,

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,901
during each warm-up,

100
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,127
it smelled of victory.

101
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,531
I swear that smell exists.

102
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,055
I smelled it several times with the team,

103
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,355
but I remember it in particular,
the day before we played that final.

104
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:22,440
The Argentine Football Association
had opened their doors to us.

105
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:23,930
We were training at AFA,

106
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:26,448
where VerÃ³n, Higuain and Messi trained.

107
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,881
For the first time ever,

108
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:31,461
we felt like a true national team.

109
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,671
At 7:30pm, the day before the game,

110
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:38,523
we were in the lounge discussing strategy,

111
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,762
and a waiter knocks on the door,
interrupting our conversation.

112
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,330
He suggested we go to church.

113
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:46,154
He came to invite us to church.

114
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:51,115
I tried to get rid of him,
saying it wasn't a good time,

115
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,968
that we better leave it for another day.

116
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:59,483
He kept insisting, asking me to please
let him take the guys to church,

117
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:02,729
because that day, a pastor
who performed miracles would be there.

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,792
I was slightly afraid to ask
what type of miracles he meant,

119
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,052
and he replied nonchalantly,

120
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,276
"Coach, let me take
the team to the church,

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,653
and when we return, I guarantee
that half of them will be able to see."

122
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,177
(Laughter)

123
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:22,101
Some of the guys laughed,

124
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,275
but imagine being a blind person
and someone says that to you.

125
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,684
I didn't know what to say.

126
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,352
I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.

127
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,120
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

128
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,318
because he truly believed
this could happen.

129
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,994
One of the players saved me,

130
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,640
when he stood up and confidently said,

131
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,548
"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --

132
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:43,525
Gonza already told you
it's not the best time to go to church.

133
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:45,330
Besides, let me make this clear:

134
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:49,236
if we go to that church, and I end up
being able to see when we return,

135
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,278
I will beat you so hard
if I can't play tomorrow."

136
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:54,006
(Laughter)

137
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,891
(Applause)

138
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:08,942
Juan left, laughing in resignation,

139
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,012
and we continued with our pregame talk.

140
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:14,580
That night when I went to sleep,

141
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:17,925
I began to dream
about the next day's game,

142
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,628
imagining what could happen,
how we would play.

143
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,108
And that's when I noticed
that smell of victory

144
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:24,346
I mentioned a while ago.

145
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,969
And it's because
at that moment, I thought:

146
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:31,676
if the other players had the same desire
as Diego going into the game,

147
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,261
it was impossible for us not to win.

148
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,961
The next day was going to be wonderful.

149
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:41,502
We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,

150
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,747
and we were already eager to play.

151
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:50,092
We left AFA, and the bus was full
of flags that people had given to us.

152
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,767
We were talking about the game,

153
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,331
and we could hear people
honking and cheering,

154
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,665
"Go MurciÃ©lagos! Today's the day!
The final challenge!"

155
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,410
The guys asked me, "Do they know us?
Do they know we're playing?"

156
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:06,542
Some people followed the bus to CENARD.

157
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,827
We arrived and found an amazing scene.

158
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:14,313
In the corridor leading
from the locker room to the game field,

159
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,289
I was walking with Silvio,

160
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,401
who was holding onto my shoulder,
so I could guide him.

161
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,688
Fortunately, there were
no gates along the way.

162
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:22,712
(Laughter)

163
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,848
When we reached the field,
he asked me about everything.

164
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,808
He didn't want to miss a single detail.

165
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:31,651
He said, "Tell me what you see,
tell me who's playing the drums."

166
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:35,570
I tried to explain what was happening
with as much detail as possible.

167
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:40,394
I told him, "The stands are packed,
a lot of people couldn't get in,

168
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:43,012
there are blue and white balloons
all over the field,

169
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:47,177
they're opening a giant Argentine flag
that covers the entire grandstand."

170
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,298
Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,

171
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,157
"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"

172
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,279
That's the city where he lives.

173
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,456
I started looking into the stands

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,989
and I spotted a little white flag

175
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:04,063
with lettering done
in black spray paint, that read:

176
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:07,690
"Silvio, your family
and all of San Pedro are here."

177
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,959
I told him that and he replied,

178
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:15,032
"That's my mom, tell me where
she is, I want to I wave at her."

179
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:16,996
I pointed him toward the flag

180
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,566
and showed him with his arm
where they were sitting,

181
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,574
and he waved his arms in that direction.

182
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:24,689
About 20 or 30 people stood up
and gave him an ovation.

183
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,730
When that happened,

184
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:29,079
I saw how his face changed,
how moved he was.

185
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:31,461
It was moving for me, too;

186
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,296
two seconds later,
I had a lump in my throat.

187
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:38,604
It was strange -- I felt both
the excitement of what was happening,

188
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,786
and the anger and the anguish
that he could not see it.

189
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:48,540
A few days later when I told him
what I had experienced,

190
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:52,510
he tried to reassure me, saying,

191
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:55,111
"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.

192
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,852
Differently, but I swear to you
that I saw them all."

193
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:00,644
The game started.

194
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,506
We could not fail; it was the final.

195
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,955
The audience was quiet, like here,

196
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,623
because in soccer for the blind,

197
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,646
the public has to be quiet
so the players can hear the ball.

198
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,813
They're only allowed to cheer
when the game is over.

199
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:16,906
And when there were eight minutes to go,

200
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:21,194
the crowd did all the cheering
they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.

201
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:24,847
When pigeon-toed Silvio
nailed the ball at an angle,

202
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,959
they cheered with all their heart,

203
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,557
in an incredible way.

204
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:35,466
Today, if you go to CENARD,
you'll see a huge poster on the door,

205
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,411
with a photo of our team,
Los MurciÃ©lagos.

206
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:42,871
They're a model national team,
everyone in CENARD knows who they are,

207
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:45,478
and after having won
two World Championships

208
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:46,899
and two Paralympic medals,

209
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,382
no one doubts they are
high-performance athletes.

210
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:56,055
(Applause)

211
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,001
(Applause ends)

212
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:10,836
I was lucky to train
this team for 10 years,

213
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,052
first as a trainer
and later as their coach.

214
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,969
I feel that they've given me much more

215
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,412
than what I've given them.

216
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:28,236
Last year, they asked me to coach
another national team, Power Soccer.

217
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:33,228
It's a national team of young men
who play soccer in wheelchairs.

218
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,871
They use motorized wheelchairs
that they drive with a joystick,

219
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,453
because they don't have
enough strength in their arms

220
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:40,770
to use conventional chairs.

221
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:44,504
They added a bumper to the chair,
a safeguard that protects their feet,

222
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,647
while allowing them to kick the ball.

223
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:51,715
It's the first time that, instead
of being the spectators,

224
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,556
they're now the main characters.

225
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,790
It's the first time their parents,
friends and siblings can see them play.

226
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,103
For me, it's a new challenge,

227
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:05,371
with the same discomfort,
insecurity, and fear I had

228
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,371
when I started working with the blind.

229
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,577
But I approach it all
from a more experienced position.

230
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:15,803
That's why from day one,
I treat them as athletes on the field,

231
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,437
and off the field, I try
to put myself in their shoes

232
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,888
and behave without prejudice,

233
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:23,869
because treating them naturally
feels best to them.

234
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:29,714
Both teams play soccer;
something once unthinkable for them.

235
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:34,059
They had to adapt the rules to do so.

236
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,653
And both teams broke the same rule --

237
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,449
the one that said
they couldn't play soccer.

238
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,813
When you see them play,
you see competition, not disability.

239
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:49,722
The problem starts when the game is over,

240
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,221
and they leave the field.

241
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:53,741
Then they step in to play our game,

242
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:57,719
in a society whose rules
don't really take them into account

243
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,908
or care for them.

244
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,340
I learned from sports

245
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,996
that disability greatly depends on
the rules of the game.

246
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:09,576
I believe that if we change
some of the rules of our game,

247
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,882
we can make life a little easier for them.

248
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,089
We all know there are people
with disabilities; we see them daily.

249
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:21,605
But by having no direct contact with them,

250
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,179
we're not aware of the problems
they face every day,

251
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,310
like how hard it is for them
to get on a bus,

252
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,985
find a job,

253
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,162
take the subway

254
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,336
or cross the street.

255
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,538
It's true that there is an increasing
social responsibility

256
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:39,408
regarding the inclusion
of people with disabilities.

257
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,959
But I think it's still not enough.

258
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:46,022
I think change needs to come
from every one of us.

259
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:49,692
First, by leaving behind
our indifference toward the disabled,

260
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:53,067
and then by respecting the rules
that do take them into account.

261
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,848
They are few, but they do exist.

262
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:00,158
I cracked a blind man's head
open -- El Pulga's head.

263
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,523
I can assure you these two teams
opened mine as well.

264
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,984
They taught me that above all,

265
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,132
you have to get out there
and play every game

266
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,386
in this beautiful tournament
that we call life.

267
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,566
Thank you.

268
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,642
(Applause)
