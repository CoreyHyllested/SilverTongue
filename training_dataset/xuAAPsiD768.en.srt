0
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,897
Father Daniel Berrigan once said
that "writing about prisoners

1
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,034
is a little like writing about the dead."

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,910
I think what he meant is that
we treat prisoners as ghosts.

3
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,001
They're unseen and unheard.

4
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:27,317
It's easy to simply ignore them

5
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:31,730
and it's even easier when the government
goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.

6
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,969
As a journalist, I think these stories

7
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:37,041
of what people in power do
when no one is watching,

8
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,492
are precisely the stories
that we need to tell.

9
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:41,597
That's why I began investigating

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,408
the most secretive and experimental
prison units in the United States,

11
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:48,198
for so-called "second-tier" terrorists.

12
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:54,507
The government calls these units
Communications Management Units or CMUs.

13
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:57,967
Prisoners and guards call them
"Little Guantanamo."

14
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:01,179
They are islands unto themselves.

15
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:05,550
But unlike Gitmo they exist
right here, at home,

16
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:08,420
floating within larger federal prisons.

17
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:10,929
There are 2 CMUs.

18
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:14,073
One was opened inside the prison
in Terre Haute, Indiana,

19
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:17,781
and the other is inside this prison,
in Marion, Illinois.

20
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:21,094
Neither of them underwent
the formal review process

21
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,294
that is required by law
when they were opened.

22
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,697
CMU prisoners have all
been convicted of crimes.

23
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:32,189
Some of their cases are questionable
and some involve threats and violence.

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,047
I'm not here to argue the guilt
or innocence of any prisoner.

25
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,923
I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall said,

26
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,404
"When the prisons and gates slam shut,

27
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:45,030
prisoners do not lose
their human quality."

28
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:51,182
Every prisoner I've interviewed
has said there are three flecks of light

29
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:53,640
in the darkness of prison:

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,862
phone calls,

31
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,037
letters

32
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:57,501
and visits from family.

33
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,069
CMUs aren't solitary confinement,
but they radically restrict all of these

34
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:05,992
to levels that meet or exceed the most
extreme prisons in the United States.

35
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:09,777
Their phone calls can be limited
to 45 minutes a month,

36
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,469
compared to the 300 minutes
other prisoners receive.

37
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:17,083
Their letters can be limited
to six pieces of paper.

38
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,947
Their visits can be limited
to four hours per month,

39
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:25,677
compared to the 35 hours that people
like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph

40
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,321
receive in the supermax.

41
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:33,203
On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact
which means prisoners are not allowed

42
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:35,141
to even hug their family.

43
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,019
As one CMU prisoner said,

44
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:41,472
"We're not being tortured here,
except psychologically."

45
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,335
The government won't say
who is imprisoned here.

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,377
But through court documents,
open records requests

47
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,959
and interviews with current
and former prisoners,

48
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:55,156
some small windows
into the CMUs have opened.

49
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:59,087
There's an estimated
60 to 70 prisoners here,

50
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:01,384
and they're overwhelmingly Muslim.

51
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,993
They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,

52
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:09,041
who violated the economic sanctions
on Iraq by sending medical supplies

53
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,599
for the children there.

54
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,396
They've included people like Yassin Aref.

55
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:20,070
Aref and his family fled to New York
from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.

56
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:23,887
He was arrested in 2004
as part of an FBI sting.

57
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:28,258
Aref is an imam and he was asked
to bear witness to a loan,

58
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,679
which is a tradition in Islamic culture.

59
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:34,519
It turned out that one of the people
involved in the loan was trying to enlist

60
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:36,907
someone else in a fake attack.

61
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,822
Aref didn't know.

62
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,831
For that, he was convicted

63
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:44,888
of conspiracy to provide material support
to a terrorist group.

64
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,539
The CMUs also include
some non-Muslim prisoners.

65
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,366
The guards call them "balancers,"

66
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,254
meaning they help balance out
the racial numbers,

67
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,337
in hopes of deflecting law suits.

68
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:01,865
These balancers include animal rights
and environmental activists

69
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,199
like Daniel McGowan.

70
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,429
McGowan was convicted
of participating in two arsons

71
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:08,565
in the name of defending the environment

72
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,922
as part of the Earth Liberation Front.

73
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,438
During his sentencing, he was afraid
that he would be sent

74
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,831
to a rumored secret prison for terrorists.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,424
The judge dismissed all those fears,

76
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,049
saying that they
weren't supported by any facts.

77
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:25,861
But that might be because the government
hasn't fully explained

78
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,287
why some prisoners end up in a CMU,

79
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,332
and who is responsible
for these decisions.

80
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,177
When McGowan was transferred, he was told

81
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,603
it's because he is a "domestic terrorist,"

82
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:42,198
a term the FBI uses repeatedly when
talking about environmental activists.

83
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:46,749
Now, keep in mind there are about 400
prisoners in US prisons

84
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:48,536
who are classified as terrorists,

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,654
and only a handful of them
are in the CMUs.

86
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,792
In McGowan's case, he was previously
at a low-security prison

87
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,939
and he had no communications violations.

88
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:00,990
So, why was he moved?

89
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,510
Like other CMU prisoners,

90
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:07,424
McGowan repeatedly asked
for an answer, a hearing,

91
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,766
or some opportunity for an appeal.

92
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:14,688
This example from another prisoner
shows how those requests are viewed.

93
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,218
"Wants a transfer." "Told him no."

94
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:23,093
At one point, the prison warden himself
recommended McGowan's transfer

95
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,390
out of the CMU citing his good behavior,

96
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:28,455
but the warden was overruled

97
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,693
by the Bureau of Prison's
Counterterrorism Unit,

98
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,671
working with the Joint Terrorism
Task Force of the FBI.

99
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,187
Later I found out that McGowan
was really sent to a CMU

100
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,130
not because of what he did,

101
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,691
but what he has said.

102
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,467
A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit
cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."

103
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,844
While imprisoned, he continued writing
about environmental issues,

104
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,686
saying that activists must
reflect on their mistakes

105
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,257
and listen to each other.

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,021
Now, in fairness, if you've spent
any time at all in Washington, DC,

107
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:04,384
you know this is really a radical
concept for the government.

108
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:05,652
(Laughter)

109
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,747
I actually asked to visit
McGowan in the CMU.

110
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,732
And I was approved.

111
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,554
That came as quite a shock.

112
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:19,579
First, because as I've discussed
on this stage before,

113
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:22,900
I learned that the FBI has been
monitoring my work.

114
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,459
Second, because it would make me the first
and only journalist to visit a CMU.

115
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,347
I had even learned

116
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:33,577
through the Bureau of Prisons
Counterterrorism Unit,

117
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,256
that they had been monitoring my speeches
about CMUs, like this one.

118
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:42,590
So how could I possibly
be approved to visit?

119
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:47,431
A few days before I went
out to the prison, I got an answer.

120
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:52,836
I was allowed to visit McGowan
as a friend, not a journalist.

121
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,601
Journalists are not allowed here.

122
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:58,517
McGowan was told by CMU officials
that if I asked any questions

123
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,460
or published any story,

124
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:03,319
that he would be punished
for my reporting.

125
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:06,772
When I arrived for our visit,
the guards reminded me

126
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:09,070
that they knew who I was
and knew about my work.

127
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,674
And they said that if I attempted
to interview McGowan,

128
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,375
the visit would be terminated.

129
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:20,168
The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs
as "self-contained housing units."

130
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:24,276
But I think that's an Orwellian way
of describing black holes.

131
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:25,957
When you visit a CMU,

132
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:29,107
you go through all the security
checkpoints that you would expect.

133
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:32,246
But then the walk
to the visitation room is silent.

134
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:38,227
When a CMU prisoner has a visit,
the rest of the prison is on lockdown.

135
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,938
I was ushered into a small room,

136
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:44,450
so small my outstretched arms
could touch each wall.

137
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:47,556
There was a grapefruit-sized
orb in the ceiling

138
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,755
for the visit to be live-monitored
by the Counterterrorism Unit

139
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,228
in West Virginia.

140
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,999
The unit insists that all the visits
have to be in English for CMU prisoners,

141
00:07:57,023 --> 00:08:00,221
which is an additional hardship
for many of the Muslim families.

142
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:04,016
There is a thick sheet of foggy,
bulletproof glass

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,298
and on the other side was Daniel McGowan.

144
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,962
We spoke through these handsets
attached to the wall

145
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:13,310
and talked about books and movies.

146
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,958
We did our best to find reasons to laugh.

147
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:19,721
To fight boredom and amuse himself
while in the CMU,

148
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:23,825
McGowan had been spreading a rumor
that I was secretly the president

149
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,820
of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC

150
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,399
(Laughter)

151
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:32,185
For the record, I'm not.

152
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,449
(Laughter)

153
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:37,352
But I kind of the hope the FBI
now thinks that Bella and Edward

154
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,522
are terrorist code names.

155
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:41,056
(Laughter)

156
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:48,515
During our visit, McGowan spoke most
and at length about his niece Lily,

157
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:54,663
his wife Jenny and how torturous
it feels to never be able to hug them,

158
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,917
to never be able to hold their hands.

159
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:01,750
Three months after our visit, McGowan
was transferred out of the CMU

160
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,790
and then, without warning,
he was sent back again.

161
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:10,196
I had published leaked
CMU documents on my website

162
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,441
and the Counterterrorism Unit said
that McGowan had called his wife

163
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,751
and asked her to mail them.

164
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,040
He wanted to see what the government
was saying about him,

165
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:21,672
and for that he was sent back to the CMU.

166
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:24,632
When he was finally released
at the end of his sentence,

167
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,738
his story got even more Kafkaesque.

168
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,974
He wrote an article
for the Huffington Post headlined,

169
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,699
"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to
a CMU for my Political Speech."

170
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:40,037
The next day he was thrown
back in jail for his political speech.

171
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,956
His attorneys quickly secured his release,

172
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,578
but the message was very clear:

173
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,301
Don't talk about this place.

174
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:53,065
Today, nine years after they were opened
by the Bush administration,

175
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,682
the government is codifying
how and why CMUs were created.

176
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,378
According to the Bureau of Prisons,

177
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:03,376
they are for prisoners
with "inspirational significance."

178
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:08,529
I think that is very nice way of saying
these are political prisons

179
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,137
for political prisoners.

180
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,520
Prisoners are sent to a CMU
because of their race,

181
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:16,191
their religion or their
political beliefs.

182
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,591
Now, if you think that
characterization is too strong,

183
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,432
just look at some
of the government's own documents.

184
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,972
When some of McGowan's mail was rejected
by the CMU, the sender was told

185
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:30,610
it's because the letters were intended
"for political prisoners."

186
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,228
When another prisoner, animal rights
activist Andy Stepanian,

187
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:40,641
was sent to a CMU, it was because of his
anti-government and anti-corporate views.

188
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:44,692
Now, I know all of this
may be hard to believe,

189
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:48,674
that it's happening right now,
and in the United States.

190
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,795
But the unknown reality
is that the US has a dark history

191
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:57,210
of disproportionately punishing people
because of their political beliefs.

192
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,116
In the 1960s, before Marion
was home to the CMU,

193
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,021
it was home to the notorious Control Unit.

194
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:09,523
Prisoners were locked down
in solitary for 22 hours a day.

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,946
The warden said the unit
was to "control revolutionary attitudes."

196
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:21,793
In the 1980s, another experiment called
the Lexington High Security Unit

197
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,245
held women connected
to the Weather Underground,

198
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,535
Black Liberation and Puerto Rican
independent struggles.

199
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:32,233
The prison radically restricted
communication and used sleep deprivation,

200
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:36,854
and constant light for so-called
"ideological conversion."

201
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:43,068
Those prisons were eventually shut down,
but only through the campaigning

202
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:47,493
of religious groups and human rights
advocates, like Amnesty International.

203
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:52,324
Today, civil rights lawyers
with the Center for Constitutional Rights

204
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:54,727
are challenging CMUs in court

205
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,306
for depriving prisoners
of their due process rights

206
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,410
and for retaliating against them

207
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:02,744
for their protected political
and religious speech.

208
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:06,964
Many of these documents would have
never come to light without this lawsuit.

209
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:13,029
The message of these groups
and my message for you today

210
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:16,809
is that we must bear witness
to what is being done to these prisoners.

211
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:21,876
Their treatment is a reflection
of the values held beyond prison walls.

212
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,955
This story is not just about prisoners.

213
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,003
It is about us.

214
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:29,774
It is about our own commitment
to human rights.

215
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:34,523
It is about whether we will choose to stop
repeating the mistakes of our past.

216
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:40,109
If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan
described as the stories of the dead,

217
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,596
they will soon become
the stories of ourselves.

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,050
Thank you.

219
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,772
(Applause)

220
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,437
(Applause ends)

221
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,684
Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions.

222
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,636
When I was in high school,
I learned about the Bill of Rights,

223
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,556
the Constitution, freedom of speech,

224
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,113
due process and
about 25 other laws and rights

225
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,921
that seem to be violated by this.

226
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,410
How could this possibly be happening?

227
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,125
Will Potter: I think that's
the number one question I get

228
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,136
throughout all of my work,

229
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,294
and the short answer is
that people don't know.

230
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:24,700
I think the solution to any of these types
of situations, any rights abuses,

231
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,417
are really dependent on two things.

232
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,237
They're dependent on knowledge
that it's actually happening

233
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:33,543
and then a means and efficacy
to actually make a change.

234
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,964
And unfortunately with these prisoners,

235
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:38,563
one, people don't know
what's happening at all

236
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,175
and then they're already
disenfranchised populations

237
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,231
who don't have access to attorneys,
not native English speakers.

238
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:48,665
In some of these cases, they have great
representation that I mentioned,

239
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,751
but there's just not a public awareness
of what's happening.

240
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:54,815
TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison
that you have right to council

241
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,380
or access to council?

242
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:58,186
WP: There's a tendency in our culture

243
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,320
to see when people have been
convicted of a crime,

244
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:03,702
no matter if that charge
was bogus or legitimate,

245
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:06,692
that whatever happens to them
after that is warranted.

246
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:10,210
And I think that's a really damaging
and dangerous narrative that we have,

247
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,694
that allows these types
of things to happen,

248
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,121
as the general public just
kind of turns a blind eye to it.

249
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:21,081
TR: All those documents on screen
were all real documents, word for word,

250
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,154
unchanged at all, right?

251
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,514
WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded
all of them to my website.

252
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:31,415
It's willpotter.com/CMU and it's
a footnoted version of the talk,

253
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,757
so you can see the documents for yourself
without the little snippets.

254
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,169
You can see the full version.

255
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:39,138
I relied overwhelmingly
on primary source documents

256
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:42,478
or on primary interviews
with former and current prisoners,

257
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:45,288
with people that are dealing
with this situation every day.

258
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,630
And like I said, I've been
there myself, as well.

259
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,360
TR: You're doing courageous work.

260
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,540
WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.

261
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,256
(Applause)
