00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:17,216
What is it that French people
do better than all the others?

1
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,380
If you would take polls,

2
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,211
the top three answers might be:

3
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:26,274
love, wine and whining.

4
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:27,599
(Laughter)

5
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:28,782
Maybe.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,868
But let me suggest a fourth one:

7
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:33,082
mathematics.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,613
Did you know that Paris
has more mathematicians

9
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,438
than any other city in the world?

10
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,295
And more streets
with mathematicians' names, too.

11
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:45,664
And if you look at the statistics
of the Fields Medal,

12
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,181
often called the Nobel Prize
for mathematics,

13
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:52,137
and always awarded to mathematicians
below the age of 40,

14
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:56,048
you will find that France has more
Fields medalists per inhabitant

15
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,240
than any other country.

16
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:01,240
What is it that we find so sexy in math?

17
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:05,357
After all, it seems to be
dull and abstract,

18
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:08,864
just numbers and computations
and rules to apply.

19
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:12,630
Mathematics may be abstract,

20
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:13,805
but it's not dull

21
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,558
and it's not about computing.

22
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,925
It is about reasoning

23
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:20,209
and proving our core activity.

24
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,035
It is about imagination,

25
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,078
the talent which we most praise.

26
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,203
It is about finding the truth.

27
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:30,350
There's nothing like the feeling
which invades you

28
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,545
when after months of hard thinking,

29
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,867
you finally understand the right
reasoning to solve your problem.

30
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:40,618
The great mathematician
André Weil likened this --

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,793
no kidding --

32
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:43,406
to sexual pleasure.

33
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:49,538
But noted that this feeling
can last for hours, or even days.

34
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:52,657
The reward may be big.

35
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:57,189
Hidden mathematical truths
permeate our whole physical world.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,350
They are inaccessible to our senses

37
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:03,098
but can be seen
through mathematical lenses.

38
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,684
Close your eyes for moment

39
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,183
and think of what is occurring
right now around you.

40
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:13,830
Invisible particles from the air
around are bumping on you

41
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:16,587
by the billions and billions
at each second,

42
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,674
all in complete chaos.

43
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,200
And still,

44
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,912
their statistics can be accurately
predicted by mathematical physics.

45
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:28,507
And open your eyes now

46
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,841
to the statistics of the velocities
of these particles.

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,750
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,

48
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:37,955
or the Law of Errors --

49
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,701
of deviations with respect
to the mean behavior.

50
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,852
This curve tells about the statistics
of velocities of particles

51
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,415
in the same way as a demographic curve

52
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,280
would tell about the statistics
of ages of individuals.

53
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:55,534
It's one of the most
important curves ever.

54
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:59,323
It keeps on occurring again and again,

55
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,750
from many theories and many experiments,

56
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:05,055
as a great example of the universality

57
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,631
which is so dear to us mathematicians.

58
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:10,921
Of this curve,

59
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:13,994
the famous scientist Francis Galton said,

60
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:18,542
"It would have been deified by the Greeks
if they had known it.

61
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:22,415
It is the supreme law of unreason."

62
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:30,420
And there's no better way to materialize
that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.

63
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:34,971
Inside this board are narrow tunnels

64
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:39,623
through which tiny balls
will fall down randomly,

65
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:45,682
going right or left, or left, etc.

66
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,390
All in complete randomness and chaos.

67
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:56,165
Let's see what happens when we look
at all these random trajectories together.

68
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,624
(Board shaking)

69
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,492
This is a bit of a sport,

70
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:09,386
because we need to resolve
some traffic jams in there.

71
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,865
Aha.

72
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:16,900
We think that randomness
is going to play me a trick on stage.

73
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,072
There it is.

74
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:24,965
Our supreme goddess of unreason.

75
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,508
the Gauss Curve,

76
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:32,984
trapped here inside this transparent box
as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.

77
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:37,321
For you I have shown it,

78
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:42,630
but to my students I explain why
it could not be any other curve.

79
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,998
And this is touching
the mystery of that goddess,

80
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:50,723
replacing a beautiful coincidence
by a beautiful explanation.

81
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,360
All of science is like this.

82
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:59,561
And beautiful mathematical explanations
are not only for our pleasure.

83
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,245
They also change our vision of the world.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,277
For instance,

85
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,451
Einstein,

86
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,626
Perrin,

87
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:07,801
Smoluchowski,

88
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:11,385
they used the mathematical analysis
of random trajectories

89
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,446
and the Gauss Curve

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,398
to explain and prove that our
world is made of atoms.

91
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,326
It was not the first time

92
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,740
that mathematics was revolutionizing
our view of the world.

93
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,767
More than 2,000 years ago,

94
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,401
at the time of the ancient Greeks,

95
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,981
it already occurred.

96
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,113
In those days,

97
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:38,420
only a small fraction of the world
had been explored,

98
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:41,486
and the Earth might have seemed infinite.

99
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,801
But clever Eratosthenes,

100
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:45,242
using mathematics,

101
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:50,377
was able to measure the Earth
with an amazing accuracy of two percent.

102
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,385
Here's another example.

103
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:58,043
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed

104
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:04,979
that a pendulum swings slightly
slower in Cayenne than in Paris.

105
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,750
From this observation alone,
and clever mathematics,

106
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:13,080
Newton rightly deduced

107
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:18,645
that the Earth is a wee bit
flattened at the poles,

108
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,270
like 0,3 percent --

109
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:25,256
so tiny that you wouldn't even
notice it on the real view of the Earth.

110
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:30,204
These stories show that mathematics

111
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:34,990
is able to make us go out of our intuition

112
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:38,997
measure the Earth which seems infinite,

113
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,315
see atoms which are invisible

114
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,720
or detect an imperceptible
variation of shape.

115
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:48,591
And if there is just one thing that you
should take home from this talk,

116
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:49,809
it is this:

117
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:54,211
mathematics allows us
to go beyond the intuition

118
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:58,484
and explore territories
which do not fit within our grasp.

119
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,608
Here's a modern example
you will all relate to:

120
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,029
searching the Internet.

121
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,379
The World Wide Web,

122
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:09,207
more than one billion web pages --

123
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,905
do you want to go through them all?

124
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,462
Computing power helps,

125
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:16,672
but it would be useless without
the mathematical modeling

126
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,259
to find the information
hidden in the data.

127
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,870
Let's work out a baby problem.

128
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:27,679
Imagine that you're a detective
working on a crime case,

129
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:31,491
and there are many people
who have their version of the facts.

130
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,777
Who do you want to interview first?

131
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:36,596
Sensible answer:

132
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,057
prime witnesses.

133
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:40,112
You see,

134
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:44,356
suppose that there is person number seven,

135
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,531
tells you a story,

136
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:47,569
but when you ask where he got if from,

137
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,629
he points to person
number three as a source.

138
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,721
And maybe person number three, in turn,

139
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:56,441
points at person number one
as the primary source.

140
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,126
Now number one is a prime witness,

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,388
so I definitely want
to interview him -- priority.

142
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,299
And from the graph

143
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:06,551
we also see that person
number four is a prime witness.

144
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,018
And maybe I even want
to interview him first,

145
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,401
because there are more
people who refer to him.

146
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:15,018
OK, that was easy,

147
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:20,288
but now what about if you have
a big bunch of people who will testify?

148
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,216
And this graph,

149
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,859
I may think of it as all people
who testify in a complicated crime case,

150
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:31,905
but it may just as well be web pages
pointing to each other,

151
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,000
referring to each other for contents.

152
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,214
Which ones are the most authoritative?

153
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:38,921
Not so clear.

154
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,991
Enter PageRank,

155
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,551
one of the early cornerstones of Google.

156
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:49,579
This algorithm uses the laws
of mathematical randomness

157
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:53,460
to determine automatically
the most relevant web pages,

158
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:58,546
in the same way as we used randomness
in the Galton Board experiment.

159
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,682
So let's send into this graph

160
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,556
a bunch of tiny, digital marbles

161
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,329
and let them go randomly
through the graph.

162
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,020
Each time they arrive at some site,

163
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:14,210
they will go out through some link
chosen at random to the next one.

164
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,987
And again, and again, and again.

165
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,986
And with small, growing piles,

166
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,763
we'll keep the record of how many
times each site has been visited

167
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:23,732
by these digital marbles.

168
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:25,394
Here we go.

169
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:27,266
Randomness, randomness.

170
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,259
And from time to time,

171
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:33,235
also let's make jumps completely
randomly to increase the fun.

172
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,687
And look at this:

173
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,143
from the chaos will emerge the solution.

174
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,968
The highest piles
correspond to those sites

175
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:45,503
which somehow are better
connected than the others,

176
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:47,800
more pointed at than the others.

177
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:49,546
And here we see clearly

178
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,602
which are the web pages
we want to first try.

179
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,658
Once again,

180
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:57,142
the solution emerges from the randomness.

181
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,026
Of course, since that time,

182
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,757
Google has come up with much more
sophisticated algorithms,

183
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:06,061
but already this was beautiful.

184
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,457
And still,

185
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,092
just one problem in a million.

186
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,004
With the advent of digital area,

187
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:18,044
more and more problems lend
themselves to mathematical analysis,

188
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:22,433
making the job of mathematician
a more and more useful one,

189
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,888
to the extent that a few years ago,

190
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:29,691
it was ranked number one
among hundreds of jobs

191
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:33,683
in a study about the best and worst jobs

192
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:36,682
published by the Wall Street
Journal in 2009.

193
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,297
Mathematician --

194
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,754
best job in the world.

195
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:44,714
That's because of the applications:

196
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:46,877
communication theory,

197
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:48,721
information theory,

198
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:50,005
game theory,

199
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,475
compressed sensing,

200
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,061
machine learning,

201
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,652
graph analysis,

202
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:56,418
harmonic analysis.

203
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:59,082
And why not stochastic processes,

204
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,736
linear programming,

205
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,788
or fluid simulation?

206
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:07,187
Each of these fields have
monster industrial applications.

207
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,362
And through them,

208
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,385
there is big money in mathematics.

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,440
And let me concede

210
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,941
that when it comes to making
money from the math,

211
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,789
the Americans are by a long shot
the world champions,

212
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:24,432
with clever, emblematic billionaires
and amazing, giant companies,

213
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:27,736
all resting, ultimately,
on good algorithm.

214
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:33,063
Now with all this beauty,
usefulness and wealth,

215
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,371
mathematics does look more sexy.

216
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,016
But don't you think

217
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,160
that the life a mathematical
researcher is an easy one.

218
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,700
It is filled with perplexity,

219
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:47,497
frustration,

220
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:50,617
a desperate fight for understanding.

221
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,095
Let me evoke for you

222
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:58,499
one of the most striking days
in my mathematician's life.

223
00:11:58,523 --> 00:11:59,674
Or should I say,

224
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,435
one of the most striking nights.

225
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:03,864
At that time,

226
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:07,039
I was staying at the Institute
for Advanced Studies in Princeton --

227
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,202
for many years, the home
of Albert Einstein

228
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:13,654
and arguably the most holy place
for mathematical research in the world.

229
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:18,722
And that night I was working
and working on an elusive proof,

230
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,124
which was incomplete.

231
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,512
It was all about understanding

232
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:27,359
the paradoxical stability
property of plasmas,

233
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,341
which are a crowd of electrons.

234
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:33,159
In the perfect world of plasma,

235
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:34,961
there are no collisions

236
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:38,643
and no friction to provide
the stability like we are used to.

237
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,543
But still,

238
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,600
if you slightly perturb
a plasma equilibrium,

239
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,312
you will find that the
resulting electric field

240
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:48,675
spontaneously vanishes,

241
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,674
or damps out,

242
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:53,992
as if by some mysterious friction force.

243
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,563
This paradoxical effect,

244
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:58,064
called the Landau damping,

245
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:01,077
is one of the most important
in plasma physics,

246
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:04,103
and it was discovered
through mathematical ideas.

247
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,121
But still,

248
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:10,375
a full mathematical understanding
of this phenomenon was missing.

249
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,185
And together with my former student
and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,

250
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,701
in Paris at the time,

251
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:20,811
we had been working for months
and months on such a proof.

252
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,167
Actually,

253
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:27,937
I had already announced by mistake
that we could solve it.

254
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:29,686
But the truth is,

255
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,857
the proof was just not working.

256
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:36,545
In spite of more than 100 pages
of complicated, mathematical arguments,

257
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,259
and a bunch discoveries,

258
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,550
and huge calculation,

259
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:40,743
it was not working.

260
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,971
And that night in Princeton,

261
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:47,296
a certain gap in the chain of arguments
was driving me crazy.

262
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:52,251
I was putting in there all my energy
and experience and tricks,

263
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,017
and still nothing was working.

264
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,435
1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,

265
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,767
not working.

266
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:04,866
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.

267
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,375
Then a few hours later,

268
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,550
waking up and go,

269
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,931
"Ah, it's time to get
the kids to school --"

270
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,106
What is this?

271
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,272
There was this voice in my head, I swear.

272
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,807
"Take the second term to the other side,

273
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,750
Fourier transform and invert in L2."

274
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:22,408
(Laughter)

275
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:24,134
Damn it,

276
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,271
that was the start of the solution!

277
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,670
You see,

278
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,977
I thought I had taken some rest,

279
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:34,389
but really my brain had
continued to work on it.

280
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,605
In those moments,

281
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:39,230
you don't think of your career
or your colleagues,

282
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,944
it's just a complete battle
between the problem and you.

283
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:45,426
That being said,

284
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,399
it does not harm when you do get
a promotion in reward for your hard work.

285
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:54,968
And after we completed our huge
analysis of the Landau damping,

286
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:56,607
I was lucky enough

287
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,661
to get the most coveted Fields Medal

288
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,552
from the hands of the President of India,

289
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:06,496
in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --

290
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,704
an honor that mathematicians
never dare to dream,

291
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:13,127
a day that I will remember until I live.

292
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:15,813
What do you think,

293
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,978
on such an occasion?

294
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,152
Pride, yes?

295
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,431
And gratitude to the many collaborators
who made this possible.

296
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:26,516
And because it was a collective adventure,

297
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,682
you need to share it,
not just with your collaborators.

298
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:37,240
I believe that everybody can appreciate
the thrill of mathematical research,

299
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:41,582
and share the passionate stories
of humans and ideas behind it.

300
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:47,268
And I've been working with my staff
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

301
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:52,473
together with partners and artists
of mathematical communication worldwide,

302
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:57,084
so that we can found our own,
very special museum of mathematics there.

303
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,314
So in a few years,

304
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,462
when you come to Paris,

305
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:08,144
after tasting the great, crispy
baguette and macaroon,

306
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,831
please come and visit us
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

307
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:14,371
and share the mathematical dream with us.

308
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,546
Thank you.

309
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:22,570
(Applause)
