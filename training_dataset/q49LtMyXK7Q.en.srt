0
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,362
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.

1
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,491
This might be the most
important sneaker in history.

2
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,914
First released in 1988,

3
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:28,479
this is the shoe that started
Nike marketing as we know it.

4
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:32,840
This is the shoe that propelled
the entire Air Jordan lineage,

5
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:34,883
and perhaps saved Nike.

6
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:37,820
The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
did for sneakers

7
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,635
what the iPhone did for phones.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,130
It's been re-released four times.

9
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:44,781
Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.

10
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,460
There's a site about what to wear
with the Black Cement.

11
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,124
It's been right under
your nose for decades

12
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:52,130
and you never looked down.

13
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:54,343
And right about now,

14
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,766
most of you are probably
thinking, "Sneakers?"

15
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,052
(Laughter)

16
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,238
Yes.

17
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,833
Yes, sneakers.

18
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:07,388
Some extraordinary things about sneakers

19
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,001
and data

20
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,500
and Nike

21
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:14,753
and how they're all related, possibly,
to the future of all online commerce.

22
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,419
In 2011,

23
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,422
the last time the Jordan 3
Black Cement was released,

24
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,779
at a retail of 160 dollars,

25
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:24,262
it sold out globally in minutes.

26
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:27,279
And that's because people were camped
outside of sneaker stores

27
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,074
for days before it went on sale.

28
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,843
And just minutes after that,

29
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:34,402
thousands of those pairs were on eBay
for two and three times retail.

30
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:39,304
In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay
right now, four years later.

31
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,705
But here's the thing:

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,187
this happens every single Saturday.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,107
Every week there's another
release or two or three,

34
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:50,385
and every shoe has a story

35
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,339
as rich and compelling
as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.

36
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,225
This is Nike building
the marketplace for sneakerheads --

37
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,025
people who collect sneakers --

38
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,297
and my daughter.

39
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,246
(Laughter)

40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,337
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.

41
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:11,413
For the brands, sneakerheads
are a very important demographic.

42
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:15,359
These are the tastemakers;
these are the Apple fanboys.

43
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,922
Because who else is going to buy

44
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:20,162
a pair of $8,000
Back to the Future sneakers?

45
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,441
(Laughter)

46
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:24,542
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.

47
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,715
And while that's obviously the anomaly,

48
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,917
the resell sneaker market
is definitely not.

49
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,765
Thirty years in the making,

50
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,725
what started as an underground culture

51
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,730
of a few people who like sneakers
just a bit too much --

52
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,154
(Laughter)

53
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,734
Now we have sneaker addictions.

54
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,686
In a market where in the past 12 months,

55
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,964
there have been over
nine million pairs of shoes

56
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:49,381
resold in the United States alone,

57
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:53,645
at a value of 1,2 billion dollars.

58
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,708
And that's a conservative estimate --

59
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:58,935
I should know, I am a sneakerhead.

60
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,466
This is my collection.

61
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,876
In the pantheon of great collections,
mine doesn't even register.

62
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:08,438
I have about 250 pairs,
but trust me, I am small-time.

63
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:10,417
People have thousands.

64
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,443
I'm a very typical
37-year-old sneakerhead.

65
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,772
I grew up playing basketball
when Michael Jordan played,

66
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,136
I always wanted Air Jordans,

67
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,129
my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,

68
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:22,546
as soon as I got some money
I bought Air Jordans --

69
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,643
literally, we all have
the exact same story.

70
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,362
But here's where mine diverged.

71
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,261
After starting three companies,
I took a job as a strategy consultant,

72
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:35,199
when I very quickly realized that
I didn't know the first thing about data.

73
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,738
But I learned, because I had to,

74
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,056
and I liked it.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,492
So I thought, I wonder if I could
get ahold of some sneaker data,

76
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,528
just to play with for my own amusement.

77
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,822
The goal was to develop a price guide,

78
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,043
a real data-driven view of the market.

79
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:54,702
And four years later, we're analyzing
over 25 million transactions,

80
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:57,642
providing real-time analytics
on thousands of sneakers.

81
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,882
Now sneakerheads check prices
while camping out for releases.

82
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,690
Others have used the data
to validate insurance claims.

83
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,762
And the top investment banks in the world

84
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:13,392
now use resell data to analyze
the retail footwear industry.

85
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,006
And here's the best part:

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,559
sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.

87
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,085
(Laughter)

88
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:23,590
Sneakerheads can track the value
of their collection over time,

89
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:24,765
compare it to others,

90
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,019
and have access to the same
analytics you might

91
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,963
for your online brokerage account.

92
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:33,891
So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection
and identifies which 352 are his.

93
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,804
He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --

94
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:38,829
frankly, a modest collection.

95
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:42,462
At the asset level,
he can see gain-loss by shoe.

96
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,000
Here he's made over
600 dollars on one pair.

97
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,514
I have one of those.

98
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,117
(Laughter)

99
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:54,102
So an unregulated
1,2 billion dollar industry

100
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,695
that thrives as much on the street
as it does online,

101
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,465
and has spawned fundamental
financial services for sneakers?

102
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,249
At some point I asked myself
what's really going on in the market,

103
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,588
and two comparisons started to emerge.

104
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:10,363
Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?

105
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:11,588
(Laughter)

106
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,480
In fact, one guy emailed to say

107
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:17,768
he thought his 15-year-old son
was selling drugs

108
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,323
and later found out
he was selling sneakers.

109
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,014
(Laughter)

110
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,288
And now they use the data
to do it together.

111
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,409
And that's because sneakers
are an investment opportunity

112
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,592
where none other exists.

113
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:32,653
And I don't just mean the kid
selling sneakers instead of drugs.

114
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,367
How about all kids?

115
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,144
You have to be 18
to play the stock market.

116
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,307
I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,

117
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,909
Blow Pops in ninth grade

118
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,354
and collected baseball cards
through high school.

119
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,175
The cards are long dead,

120
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,572
and the candy market's
usually quite local.

121
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:54,849
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal
and accessible investment opportunity --

122
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,640
a democratized stock market,

123
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,735
but also unregulated.

124
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,541
Which is why the story
you're probably most familiar with

125
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,980
is people killing each other for sneakers.

126
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:10,381
And while that definitely
happens and is tragic,

127
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:14,250
it's not nearly the epidemic
some media would have you believe.

128
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:18,459
In fact, it's a very small piece
of a much bigger and better story.

129
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,179
So sneakers have clear similarities

130
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:23,307
to both the stock exchange
and the illegal drug trade,

131
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,728
but perhaps the most fundamental
is the existence of a central actor.

132
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,735
Someone is making the rules.

133
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:34,981
In the case of sneakers,
that someone is Nike.

134
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,162
Let me walk you through some numbers.

135
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,422
The resell market,
we know, is $1,2 billion.

136
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,744
Nike, including Jordan brand,

137
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:48,284
accounts for 96 percent of all shoes
sold on the secondary market.

138
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,900
Just complete domination.

139
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:52,512
Sneakerheads love Jordans.

140
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:55,547
And profit on the secondary market
is about a third.

141
00:06:55,571 --> 00:07:00,641
That means that sneakerheads
made 380 million dollars

142
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,553
selling Nikes last year.

143
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,047
Let's jump to retail for a second.

144
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,491
Skechers, earlier this year,

145
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:09,305
became the number two
footwear brand in the country,

146
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,163
surpassing Adidas --
this was a big deal.

147
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,961
And in the 12 months ending in June,

148
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:19,049
Skechers's net income
was 209 million dollars.

149
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,187
That means that Nike's customers

150
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,747
make almost twice as much profit
as their closest competitor.

151
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,557
That --

152
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:33,005
(Laughter)

153
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,605
How is that even possible?

154
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,830
The sneaker market
is just supply and demand,

155
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:43,576
but Nike's gotten very good at using
supply -- limited sneakers --

156
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,413
and the distribution of those sneakers
to their own benefit.

157
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,449
So it's really just supply.

158
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:53,238
Sneakerheads joke that as long
as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.

159
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:57,071
Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars
do so because they're very rare.

160
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:59,861
It's no different than any other
collectible market,

161
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:02,965
only this isn't a market at all.

162
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,953
It's a false construct created by Nike --

163
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:10,258
ingeniously created by Nike, in the most
positive sense -- to sell more shoes.

164
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,764
And in the process,

165
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,156
it provided tens of thousands of people
with life-long passions,

166
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,661
myself included.

167
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:20,703
If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,
they could do so tomorrow,

168
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:22,759
all they have to do is release more shoes.

169
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,300
But we certainly don't want them to,
nor is it in their best interest.

170
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:31,582
That's because unlike Apple, who will sell
an iPhone to anyone who wants one,

171
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:35,424
Nike doesn't make their money
by just selling $200 sneakers.

172
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,699
They sell millions of shoes to millions
of people for 60 dollars.

173
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,685
And sneakerheads are the ones
who drive the marketing

174
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,239
and the hype and the PR
and the brand cachet,

175
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,803
and enable Nike to sell millions
of $60 sneakers.

176
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:50,882
It's marketing.

177
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,018
It's marketing the likes of which
has never been seen before --

178
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,462
this isn't in any textbook.

179
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:59,026
For 15 years Nike has propped up
an artificial commodities market,

180
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,513
with a Facebook-level hyped IPO
every single weekend.

181
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,210
Drive by any Footlocker at 8am
on a Saturday morning,

182
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,185
and there will be a line down the street
and around the block,

183
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,070
and sometimes those kids
have been waiting there all week.

184
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:16,208
You know those crazy iPhone lines
you see on the news every other year?

185
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:20,522
Nike lines happen 104 times more often.

186
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:22,603
So Nike sets the rules.

187
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,401
And they do so by controlling
supply and distribution.

188
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:29,911
But once a pair leaves
the retail channel, it's the Wild West.

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,003
There are very few -- if any --
legal, unregulated markets of this size.

190
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,803
So Nike is definitely
not the stock exchange.

191
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,610
In fact, there is no central exchange.

192
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:47,372
By last count, there were 48 different
online markets that I know of.

193
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,478
Some are eBay clones,
some are mobile markets,

194
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:54,524
and then you have consignment shops
and brick-and-mortar stores,

195
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:56,612
and sneaker conventions,
and reseller sites,

196
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:59,041
and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --

197
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,597
literally, anywhere sneakerheads
come into contact with each other,

198
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,611
shoes will be bought and sold.

199
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:10,515
But that means no efficiencies,
no transparency,

200
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,755
sometimes not even authenticity.

201
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:16,377
Can you imagine if that's
how stocks were bought?

202
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,409
What if the way to buy
a share of Apple stock

203
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:22,288
was to search over 100 places
online and off,

204
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,535
including every time
you walk down the street

205
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,197
just hoping to pass someone
wearing some Apple stock?

206
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:29,088
Never knowing who had the best price,

207
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:31,679
or even if the stock
you were looking at was real.

208
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,520
That would surely make you say:

209
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,598
[WTF?]

210
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,909
Of course that's not how we buy stock.

211
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,923
But what if that's not how
we need to buy sneakers either?

212
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,305
What if the inverse is true,

213
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:45,915
and what if we could buy sneakers

214
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,732
exactly the same way as we buy stock?

215
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:50,645
And what if it wasn't just sneakers,
but any similar product,

216
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,772
like watches and handbags
and women's shoes,

217
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:56,144
and any collectible, any seasonal item
and any markdown item?

218
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:59,411
What if there was
a stock market for commerce?

219
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,868
A stock market of things.

220
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:08,490
And not only could you buy in a much more
educated and efficient manner,

221
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:11,754
but you could engage in all
the sophisticated financial transactions

222
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,361
you can with the stock market.

223
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:14,988
Shorts and options and futures

224
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,122
and well, maybe you see
where this is going.

225
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:22,069
Maybe you want to invest
in a stock market of things.

226
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:29,269
Because if you had invested in a pair
of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,

227
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,690
you could either be wearing them onstage,

228
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,633
(Laughter)

229
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:36,954
or have earned 162 percent
on your money --

230
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,015
double the S&amp;P and 20 percent
more than Apple.

231
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,758
(Laughter)

232
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,664
And that's why
we're talking about sneakers.

233
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,379
Thank you.

234
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,325
(Applause)
