00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,451
Today, I am going to talk about anger.

1
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,130
When I was 11,

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,462
seeing some of my friends
leaving the school

3
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:30,684
because their parents
could not afford textbooks

4
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:33,186
made me angry.

5
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:38,068
When I was 27,

6
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:43,280
hearing the plight
of a desperate slave father

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,292
whose daughter was
about to be sold to a brothel

8
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:50,683
made me angry.

9
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:54,763
At the age of 50,

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:59,586
lying on the street,
in a pool of blood,

11
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:02,532
along with my own son,

12
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:04,999
made me angry.

13
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,484
Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.

14
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,486
Our parents, teachers, priests --

15
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:21,371
everyone taught us how to control
and suppress our anger.

16
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,146
But I ask why?

17
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:32,513
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?

18
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:34,109
Why can't we use our anger

19
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,615
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?

20
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:44,176
That I tried to do.

21
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,847
Friends,

22
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:55,370
most of the brightest ideas
came to my mind out of anger.

23
00:01:55,814 --> 00:02:05,514
Like when I was 35 and sat
in a locked-up, tiny prison.

24
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:09,067
The whole night, I was angry.

25
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:13,017
But it has given birth to a new idea.

26
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:16,176
But I will come to that later on.

27
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:23,041
Let me begin with the story
of how I got a name for myself.

28
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:29,622
I had been a big admirer
of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.

29
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:36,321
Gandhi fought and lead
India's freedom movement.

30
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,299
But more importantly,

31
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:46,034
he taught us how to treat
the most vulnerable sections,

32
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:50,305
the most deprived people,
with dignity and respect.

33
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:56,562
And so, when India was celebrating

34
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,829
Mahatma Gandhi's
birth centenary in 1969 --

35
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,117
at that time I was 15 --

36
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:04,474
an idea came to my mind.

37
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:09,244
Why can't we celebrate it differently?

38
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:14,672
I knew, as perhaps
many of you might know,

39
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:22,665
that in India, a large number of people
are born in the lowest segment of caste.

40
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:27,324
And they are treated as untouchables.

41
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:28,656
These are the people --

42
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:33,066
forget about allowing them
to go to the temples,

43
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:40,250
they cannot even go into the houses
and shops of high-caste people.

44
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,564
So I was very impressed with
the leaders of my town

45
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:50,102
who were speaking very highly against
the caste system and untouchability

46
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,274
and talking of Gandhian ideals.

47
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,944
So inspired by that, I thought,
let us set an example

48
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:03,389
by inviting these people to eat food
cooked and served

49
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,619
by the untouchable community.

50
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,551
I went to some low-caste,
so-called untouchable, people,

51
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,807
tried to convince them,
but it was unthinkable for them.

52
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:21,760
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.
It never happened."

53
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,784
I said, "Look at these leaders,

54
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,221
they are so great,
they are against untouchability.

55
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,911
They will come. If nobody comes,
we can set an example."

56
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:38,751
These people thought that I was too naive.

57
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,651
Finally, they were convinced.

58
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:48,352
My friends and I took our bicycles
and invited political leaders.

59
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:53,126
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,722
to see that each one of them
agreed to come.

61
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:02,083
I thought, "Great idea.
We can set an example.

62
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,711
We can bring about change in the society."

63
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:09,004
The day has come.

64
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:15,467
All these untouchables,
three women and two men,

65
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,816
they agreed to come.

66
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:25,075
I could recall that they had used
the best of their clothes.

67
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,740
They brought new utensils.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,339
They had taken baths
hundreds of times

69
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,300
because it was unthinkable
for them to do.

70
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,944
It was the moment of change.

71
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:41,702
They gathered. Food was cooked.

72
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,000
It was 7 o'clock.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,876
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,

74
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:52,857
because it's not very uncommon
that the leaders become late,

75
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,539
for an hour or so.

76
00:05:55,239 --> 00:06:01,922
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
and went to these leaders' homes,

77
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,278
just to remind them.

78
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:10,945
One of the leader's wives told me,

79
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:15,960
"Sorry, he is having some headache,
perhaps he cannot come."

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,037
I went to another leader

81
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:22,097
and his wife told me,
"Okay, you go, he will definitely join."

82
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:27,469
So I thought that the dinner
will take place,

83
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,952
though not at that large a scale.

84
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:39,319
I went back to the venue, which was
a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.

85
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,053
It was 10 o'clock.

86
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,822
None of the leaders showed up.

87
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,835
That made me angry.

88
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:58,679
I was standing, leaning against
Mahatma Gandhi's statue.

89
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,310
I was emotionally drained,
rather exhausted.

90
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,375
Then I sat down where
the food was lying.

91
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,785
I kept my emotions on hold.

92
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:24,279
But then, when I took the first bite,

93
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,210
I broke down in tears.

94
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,149
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.

95
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:38,047
And it was the healing, motherly touch
of an untouchable woman.

96
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:42,278
And she told me,
"Kailash, why are you crying?

97
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,011
You have done your bit.

98
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,136
You have eaten the food
cooked by untouchables,

99
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,127
which has never happened in our memory."

100
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:57,789
She said, "You won today."

101
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,759
And my friends, she was right.

102
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,789
I came back home, a little after midnight,

103
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,363
shocked to see that several
high-caste elderly people

104
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,517
were sitting in my courtyard.

105
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,613
I saw my mother and
elderly women were crying

106
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:22,071
and they were pleading
to these elderly people

107
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:25,005
because they had threatened
to outcaste my whole family.

108
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:31,477
And you know, outcasting the family
is the biggest social punishment

109
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,031
one can think of.

110
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:40,821
Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
and the punishment was purification.

111
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:45,336
That means I had to go 600 miles
away from my hometown

112
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:49,267
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.

113
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:53,691
And after that, I should organize a feast
for priests, 101 priests,

114
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,239
wash their feet and drink that water.

115
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,528
It was total nonsense,

116
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:04,417
and I refused to accept that punishment.

117
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,397
How did they punish me?

118
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:13,194
I was barred from entering into my own
kitchen and my own dining room,

119
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,246
my utensils were separated.

120
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:21,300
But the night when I was angry,
they wanted to outcaste me.

121
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,633
But I decided to outcaste
the entire caste system.

122
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:32,228
(Applause)

123
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:38,003
And that was possible because
the beginning would have been

124
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:40,119
to change the family name, or surname,

125
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,784
because in India, most of
the family names are caste names.

126
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,306
So I decided to drop my name.

127
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:52,810
And then, later on, I gave
a new name to myself: Satyarthi,

128
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,776
that means, "seeker of truth."

129
00:09:57,216 --> 00:10:01,248
(Applause)

130
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:04,585
And that was the beginning
of my transformative anger.

131
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,704
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,

132
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:13,530
what was I doing before becoming
a children's rights activist?

133
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,788
Does anybody know?

134
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,169
No.

135
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:24,558
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.

136
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:29,662
And then I learned how the energy

137
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:34,146
of burning fire, coal,

138
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:38,250
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,

139
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,442
raging river currents,

140
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:45,066
fierce winds,

141
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:50,083
could be converted into the light
and lives of millions.

142
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:55,495
I also learned how the most
uncontrollable form of energy

143
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:59,970
could be harnessed for good
and making society better.

144
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:11,692
So I'll come back to the story
of when I was caught in the prison:

145
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:15,919
I was very happy freeing
a dozen children from slavery,

146
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,890
handing them over to their parents.

147
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,078
I cannot explain my joy
when I free a child.

148
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,428
I was so happy.

149
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:31,021
But when I was waiting for my train
to come back to my hometown, Delhi,

150
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,264
I saw that dozens of children
were arriving;

151
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:37,562
they were being trafficked by someone.

152
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,415
I stopped them, those people.

153
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,517
I complained to the police.

154
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:47,071
So the policemen, instead of helping me,

155
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,773
they threw me in this small,
tiny shell, like an animal.

156
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,121
And that was the night of anger

157
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:58,972
when one of the brightest
and biggest ideas was born.

158
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:05,100
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10
children, and 50 more will join,

159
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,560
that's not done.

160
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,368
And I believed in the power of consumers,

161
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:12,852
and let me tell you that this
was the first time

162
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:17,968
when a campaign was launched by me
or anywhere in the world,

163
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:22,041
to educate and sensitize the consumers

164
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,501
to create a demand
for child-labor-free rugs.

165
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:31,083
In Europe and America,
we have been successful.

166
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,768
And it has resulted
in a fall in child labor

167
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:39,024
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.

168
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,406
(Applause)

169
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:51,397
Not only that, but this first-ever
consumer's power, or consumer's campaign

170
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:55,505
has grown in other countries
and other industries,

171
00:12:55,505 --> 00:13:00,931
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel,
maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.

172
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,823
My anger at the age of 11,

173
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:10,176
when I realized how important
education is for every child,

174
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:17,821
I got an idea to collect used books
and help the poorest children.

175
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:21,270
I created a book bank at the age of 11.

176
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,813
But I did not stop.

177
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:26,046
Later on, I cofounded

178
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:30,580
the world's single largest civil society
campaign for education

179
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,571
that is the Global Campaign for Education.

180
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:38,866
That has helped in changing
the whole thinking towards education

181
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:41,257
from the charity mode
to the human rights mode,

182
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:46,026
and that has concretely helped
the reduction of out-of-school children

183
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,614
by half in the last 15 years.

184
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:53,693
(Applause)

185
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,867
My anger at the age of 27,

186
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:04,235
to free that girl who was about
to be sold to a brothel,

187
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:09,018
has given me an idea

188
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:13,271
to go for a new strategy
of raid and rescue,

189
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:16,188
freeing children from slavery.

190
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:22,614
And I am so lucky and proud to say
that it is not one or 10 or 20,

191
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:28,957
but my colleagues and I have been able
to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves

192
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:32,093
and hand them over
back to their families and mothers.

193
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:35,452
(Applause)

194
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,979
I knew that we needed global policies.

195
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,011
We organized the worldwide marches
against child labor

196
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:49,073
and that has also resulted in
a new international convention

197
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:53,172
to protect the children
who are in the worst forms.

198
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:58,351
And the concrete result was that
the number of child laborers globally

199
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:03,891
has gone down by one third
in the last 15 years.

200
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:08,311
(Applause)

201
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,721
So, in each case,

202
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:15,510
it began from anger,

203
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,159
turned into an idea,

204
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,565
and action.

205
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,441
So anger, what next?

206
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,920
Idea, and --

207
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,278
Audience: Action

208
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,835
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
Which I tried to do.

209
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:36,751
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,

210
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,552
and the law of nature is that energy

211
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:44,795
can never be created and never
be vanished, can never be destroyed.

212
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:51,685
So why can't the energy of anger
be translated and harnessed

213
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:56,221
to create a better and beautiful world,
a more just and equitable world?

214
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,341
Anger is within each one of you,

215
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:05,241
and I will share a secret
for a few seconds:

216
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:12,795
that if we are confined in
the narrow shells of egos,

217
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:17,225
and the circles of selfishness,

218
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:24,709
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

219
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,595
But if we are able to break the circles,

220
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:34,481
then the same anger could turn
into a great power.

221
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:38,828
We can break the circles
by using our inherent compassion

222
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:42,678
and connect with the world through
compassion to make this world better.

223
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:46,351
That same anger could be
transformed into it.

224
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:50,936
So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
again, as a Nobel Laureate,

225
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:54,711
I am urging you to become angry.

226
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,983
I am urging you to become angry.

227
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:04,299
And the angriest among us

228
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:11,510
is the one who can transform his anger
into idea and action.

229
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,275
Thank you so much.

230
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:18,245
(Applause)

231
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:30,924
Chris Anderson: For many years,
you've been an inspiration to others.

232
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,109
Who or what inspires you and why?

233
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,341
KS: Good question.

234
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:40,335
Chris, let me tell you,
and that is the truth,

235
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:44,849
each time when I free a child,

236
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,028
the child who has lost all his hope
that he will ever come back to his mother,

237
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:53,335
the first smile of freedom,

238
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,890
and the mother who has lost all hope

239
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:02,501
that the son or daughter
can ever come back and sit in her lap,

240
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,656
they become so emotional

241
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:09,809
and the first tear of joy
rolls down on her cheek,

242
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,154
I see the glimpse of God in it --
this is my biggest inspiration.

243
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:18,032
And I am so lucky that not once,
as I said before, but thousands of times,

244
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:21,628
I have been able to witness my God
in the faces of those children

245
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,640
and they are my biggest inspirations.

246
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,652
Thank you.

247
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:27,665
(Applause)
