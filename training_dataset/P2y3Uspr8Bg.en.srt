0
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,735
So this right here

1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,816
is the tiny village of Elle,
close to Lista.

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,200
It's right at the southernmost
tip of Norway.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,736
And on January 2 this year,

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,976
an elderly guy who lives in the village,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,896
he went out to see what was cast ashore

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,520
during a recent storm.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,296
And on a patch of grass
right next to the water's edge,

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
he found a wetsuit.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,320
It was grey and black,
and he thought it looked cheap.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,296
Out of each leg of the wetsuit

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
there were sticking two white bones.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,320
It was clearly the remains
of a human being.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,296
And usually, in Norway,
dead people are identified quickly.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,856
So the police started searching

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,976
through missing reports
from the local area,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,216
national missing reports,

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,696
and looked for accidents
with a possible connection.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,920
They found nothing.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,416
So they ran a DNA profile,

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,576
and they started searching
internationally through Interpol.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
Nothing.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,760
This was a person
that nobody seemed to be missing.

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,160
It was an invisible life
heading for a nameless grave.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,736
But then, after a month,

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,056
the police in Norway got a message
from the police in the Netherlands.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,696
A couple of months earlier,
they had found a body,

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,000
in an identical wetsuit,
and they had no idea who this person was.

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,696
But the police in the Netherlands
managed to trace the wetsuit

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,096
by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,296
So they were then able to tell

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,656
that both wetsuits were bought
by the same customer at the same time,

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,136
October 7, 2014,

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,760
in the French city of Calais
by the English Channel.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,936
But this was all
they were able to figure out.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,616
The customer paid cash.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,256
There was no surveillance
footage from the shop.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,760
So it became a cold case.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,056
We heard this story,

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,319
and it triggered me and my colleague,
photographer Tomm Christiansen,

40
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:15,416
and we of course had the obvious question:
who were these people?

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
At the time, I'd barely
heard about Calais,

42
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:20,295
but it took about two
or three seconds to figure out

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,256
Calais is basically known for two things.

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,096
It's the spot in continental Europe
closest to Britain,

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,656
and a lot of migrants and refugees
are staying in this camp

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,896
and are trying desperately
to cross over to Britain.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,856
And right there was a plausible theory
about the identity of the two people,

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,256
and the police made this theory as well.

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,471
Because if you or I or anybody else
with a firm connection to Europe

50
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,696
goes missing off the coast of France,
people would just know.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,976
Your friends or family
would report you missing,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,776
the police would come search for you,
the media would know,

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,056
and there would be
pictures of you on lampposts.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
It's difficult to disappear
without a trace.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,976
But if you just fled the war in Syria,

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,976
and your family,
if you have any family left,

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,056
don't necessarily know where you are,

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,096
and you're staying here illegally

59
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,960
amongst thousands of others
who come and go every day.

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, if you disappear one day,
nobody will notice.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,886
The police won't come search for you
because nobody knows you're gone.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,896
And this is what happened
to Shadi Omar Kataf

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,240
and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

64
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:27,816
Me and Tomm went to Calais
for the first time in April this year,

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,176
and after three months of investigation,
we were able to tell the story

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,976
about how these two young men
fled the war in Syria,

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,736
ended up stuck in Calais,

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,136
bought wetsuits and drowned
in what seems to have been an attempt

69
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,120
to swim across the English Channel
in order to reach England.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,496
It is a story about the fact
that everybody has a name,

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,960
everybody has a story,
everybody is someone.

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,096
But it is also a story about what
it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,056
So this is where we started our search.

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,576
This is in Calais.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,696
Right now, between 3,500
and 5,000 people are living here

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,296
under horrible conditions.

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,296
It has been dubbed
the worst refugee camp in Europe.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,376
Limited access to food,
limited access to water,

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,896
limited access to health care.

80
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Disease and infections are widespread.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,096
And they're all stuck here
because they're trying to get to England

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,536
in order to claim asylum.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,096
And they do that by hiding in the back
of trucks headed for the ferry,

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
or the Eurotunnel,

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,776
or they sneak inside
the tunnel terminal at night

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,680
to try to hide on the trains.

87
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,456
Most want to go to Britain
because they know the language,

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,976
and so they figure it would be easier
to restart their lives from there.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,816
They want to work, they want to study,

90
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,976
they want to be able
to continue their lives.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,936
A lot of these people are
highly educated and skilled workers.

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,496
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,
you'll meet lawyers, politicians,

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,176
engineers, graphic designers,
farmers, soldiers.

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,629
You've got the whole spectrum.

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,896
But who all of these people are

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,376
usually gets lost in the way
we talk about refugees and migrants,

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,416
because we usually do that in statistics.

98
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,616
So you have 60 million refugees globally.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,656
About half a million
have made the crossing

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,136
over the Mediterranean
into Europe so far this year,

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,416
and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,936
But these are numbers,

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,776
and the numbers don't say anything
about who these people are,

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,280
where they came from, or why they're here.

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,879
And first, I want to tell you
about one of them.

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,096
This is 22-year-old
Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,016
We first heard about him
after being in Calais the first time

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,816
looking for answers to the theory
of the two dead bodies.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,976
And after a while, we heard this story

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,296
about a Syrian man
who was living in Bradford in England,

111
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,096
and had been desperately searching
for his nephew Mouaz for months.

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,096
And it turned out the last time
anybody had heard anything from Mouaz

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,776
was October 7, 2014.

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,360
That was the same date
the wetsuits were bought.

115
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,376
So we flew over there and we met the uncle

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,496
and we did DNA samples of him,

117
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,816
and later on got additional DNA samples
from Mouaz's closest relative

118
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,040
who now lives in Jordan.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,696
The analysis concluded

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,216
the body who was found in a wetsuit
on a beach in the Netherlands

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.

122
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,216
And while we were doing
all this investigation,

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
we got to know Mouaz's story.

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,216
He was born in the Syrian capital
of Damascus in 1991.

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,098
He was raised in a middle class family,

126
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:23,789
and his father in the middle there
is a chemical engineer

127
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:28,096
who spent 11 years in prison for belonging
to the political opposition in Syria.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,736
While his father was in prison,

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,016
Mouaz took responsibility
and he cared for his three sisters.

130
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,016
They said he was that kind of guy.

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,816
Mouaz studied to become
an electrical engineer

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,416
at the University of Damascus.

133
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,416
So a couple of years into the Syrian war,

134
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,576
the family fled Damascus and went
to the neighboring country, Jordan.

135
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,136
Their father had problems
finding work in Jordan,

136
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,136
and Mouaz could not continue his studies,

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,456
so he figured, "OK, the best thing
I can do to help my family

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,216
would be to go somewhere
where I can finish my studies

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,776
and find work."

140
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,216
So he goes to Turkey.

141
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
In Turkey, he's not accepted
at a university,

142
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,216
and once he had left Jordan as a refugee,
he was not allowed to reenter.

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,856
So then he decides to head for the UK,

144
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,416
where his uncle lives.

145
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,576
He makes it into Algeria,
walks into Libya,

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,416
pays a people smuggler to help him
with the crossing into Italy by boat,

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,336
and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,

148
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,040
the city right next to Calais
by the English Channel.

149
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:29,336
We know he made at least 12 failed
attempts to cross the English Channel

150
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
by hiding in a truck.

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,200
But at some point,
he must have given up all hope.

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,416
The last night we know he was alive,

153
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
he spent at a cheap hotel
close to the train station in Dunkirk.

154
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,997
We found his name in the records,
and he seems to have stayed there alone.

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,616
The day after, he went into Calais,
entered a sports shop

156
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,096
a couple of minutes
before 8 o'clock in the evening,

157
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,656
along with Shadi Kataf.

158
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,696
They both bought wetsuits,

159
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,136
and the woman in the shop

160
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,732
was the last person we know of
to have seen them alive.

161
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,056
We have tried to figure out
where Shadi met Mouaz,

162
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,496
but we weren't able to do that.

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,616
But they do have a similar story.

164
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,536
We first heard about Shadi
after a cousin of his, living in Germany,

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,016
had read an Arabic translation
of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.

166
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,374
So we got in touch with him.

167
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,456
Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,

168
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,856
was also raised in Damascus.

169
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,416
He was a working kind of guy.

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,856
He ran a tire repair shop
and later worked in a printing company.

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,776
He lived with his extended family,

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,736
but their house got bombed
early in the war.

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,680
So the family fled to an area
of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.

174
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,936
Yarmouk is being described
as the worst place to live

175
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,159
on planet Earth.

176
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,015
They've been bombed by the military,
they've been besieged,

177
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,421
they've been stormed by ISIS

178
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,296
and they've been cut off
from supplies for years.

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,463
There was a UN official
who visited last year,

180
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:03,607
and he said, "They ate all the grass
so there was no grass left."

181
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,816
Out of a population of 150,000,

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,936
only 18,000 are believed
to still be left in Yarmouk.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,016
Shadi and his sisters got out.

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
The parents are still stuck inside.

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,936
So Shadi and one of his sisters,
they fled to Libya.

186
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,627
This was after the fall of Gaddafi,

187
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,891
but before Libya turned
into full-blown civil war.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,456
And in this last remaining
sort of stability in Libya,

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,600
Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed
to spend most of his time underwater.

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
He fell completely in love with the ocean,

191
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,896
so when he finally decided
that he could no longer be in Libya,

192
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,176
late August 2014,

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,080
he hoped to find work
as a diver when he reached Italy.

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,440
Reality was not that easy.

195
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,336
We don't know much about his travels

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,056
because he had a hard time
communicating with his family,

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,096
but we do know that he struggled.

198
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,496
And by the end of September,

199
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,806
he was living on the streets
somewhere in France.

200
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,856
On October 7, he calls
his cousin in Belgium,

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,856
and explains his situation.

202
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,056
He said, "I'm in Calais. I need you
to come get my backpack and my laptop.

203
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,016
I can't afford to pay the people smugglers
to help me with the crossing to Britain,

204
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
but I will go buy a wetsuit
and I will swim."

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,016
His cousin, of course,
tried to warn him not to,

206
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,176
but Shadi's battery
on the phone went flat,

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
and his phone was never switched on again.

208
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,576
What was left of Shadi
was found nearly three months later,

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,536
800 kilometers away

210
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,600
in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.

211
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,696
He's still waiting
for his funeral in Norway,

212
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,280
and none of his family
will be able to attend.

213
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,616
Many may think that the story
about Shadi and Mouaz

214
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
is a story about death,

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,016
but I don't agree.

216
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,496
To me, this is a story about two questions
that I think we all share:

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,296
what is a better life,

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
and what am I willing to do to achieve it?

219
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,536
And to me, and probably a lot of you,

220
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,136
a better life would mean

221
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,056
being able to do more
of what we think of as meaningful,

222
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
whether that be spending more time
with your family and friends,

223
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,616
travel to an exotic place,

224
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,976
or just getting money
to buy that cool new device

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,696
or a pair of new sneakers.

226
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,440
And this is all
within our reach pretty easily.

227
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,776
But if you are fleeing a war zone,

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,776
the answers to those two questions
are dramatically different.

229
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,056
A better life is a life in safety.

230
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,416
It's a life in dignity.

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,096
A better life means
not having your house bombed,

232
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,656
not fearing being kidnapped.

233
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,109
It means being able
to send your children to school,

234
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,296
go to university,

235
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,736
or just find work to be able to provide
for yourself and the ones you love.

236
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,376
A better life would be
a future of some possibilities

237
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,696
compared to nearly none,

238
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
and that's a strong motivation.

239
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,576
And I have no trouble imagining

240
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,096
that after spending weeks or even months

241
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,016
as a second-grade citizen,

242
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,176
living on the streets
or in a horrible makeshift camp

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,656
with a stupid, racist name
like "The Jungle,"

244
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,200
most of us would be willing
to do just about anything.

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,456
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz

246
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,536
the second they stepped into the freezing
waters of the English Channel,

247
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,320
they would probably say,
"This is worth the risk,"

248
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,120
because they could
no longer see any other option.

249
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
And that's desperation,

250
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,800
but that's the reality of living
as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.

251
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,976
Thank you.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,216
(Applause)

253
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,550
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.

254
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,816
This is Tomm Christiansen,

255
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,602
who took most of the pictures you have
seen and they've done reporting together.

256
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,056
Tomm, you two have been
back to Calais recently.

257
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,696
This was the third trip.

258
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,776
It was after the publication
of the article.

259
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,936
What has changed?
What have you seen there?

260
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,389
Tomm Christiansen:
The first time we were in Calais,

261
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,056
it was about 1,500 refugees there.

262
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,736
They had a difficult time,
but they were positive, they had hope.

263
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,776
The last time, the camp has grown,
maybe four or five thousand people.

264
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,376
It seemed more permanent,
NGOs have arrived,

265
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,216
a small school has opened.

266
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,616
But the thing is that the refugees
have stayed for a longer time,

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,536
and the French government has managed
to seal off the borders better,

268
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,616
so now The Jungle is growing,

269
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,856
along with the despair
and hopelessness among the refugees.

270
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,576
BG: Are you planning to go back?
And continue the reporting?

271
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,816
TC: Yes.

272
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,856
BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,

273
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,296
and to me, it's amazing
that in the current climate

274
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,856
of slashing budgets
and publishers in crisis,

275
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,776
Dagbladet has consented
so many resources for this story,

276
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,658
which tells a lot about newspapers
taking the responsibility,

277
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,602
but how did you sell it to your editors?

278
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,376
Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,

279
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,376
because we weren't able to know
what we actually could figure out.

280
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,656
As soon as it became clear

281
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,136
that we actually could be able
to identify who the first one was,

282
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,216
we basically got the message
that we could do whatever we wanted,

283
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,256
just travel wherever you need to go,
do whatever you need to do,

284
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,400
just get this done.

285
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,056
BG: That's an editor
taking responsibility.

286
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,700
The story, by the way,
has been translated and published

287
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:31,976
across several European countries,
and certainly will continue to do.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,536
And we want to read the updates from you.
Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.

289
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,960
(Applause)
