00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,603
So I thought I'd talk about identity.

1
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:18,036
That's sort of an interesting
enough topic to me.

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,214
And the reason was,
because when I was asked to do this,

3
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,777
I'd just read, in one of the papers,
I can't remember,

4
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:28,180
something from someone at Facebook
saying, well,

5
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,820
"we need to make everybody
use their real names."

6
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:32,178
and then that's basically
all the problems solved.

7
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,123
And that's so wrong,

8
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:38,066
that's such a fundamentally,
reactionary view of identity,

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,471
and it's going to get us
into all sorts of trouble.

10
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:41,829
And so what I thought I'd do

11
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:45,834
is I'll explain four
sort of problems about it,

12
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,797
and then I'll suggest a solution,

13
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,869
which hopefully you
might find interesting.

14
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,920
So just to frame the problem,

15
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,510
what does authenticity mean?

16
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:58,600
That's me, that's
a camera phone picture of me

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,580
looking at a painting.

18
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:00,345
[What's the Problem?]

19
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,477
That's a painting that was painted

20
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,519
by a very famous forger,

21
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:05,782
and because I'm not very good
at presentations,

22
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:08,521
I already can't remember the name
that I wrote on my card.

23
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,399
And he was incarcerated
in, I think, Wakefield Prison

24
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,965
for forging masterpieces by,
I think, French Impressionists.

25
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,144
And he's so good at it,
that when he was in prison,

26
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,520
everybody in prison,
the governor and whatever,

27
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:23,367
wanted him to paint masterpieces
to put on the walls,

28
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,659
because they were so good.

29
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,043
And so that's a masterpiece,

30
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,042
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

31
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:34,705
and bonded into the canvas is a chip
which identifies that as a real fake,

32
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,237
if you see what I mean.

33
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,429
(Laughter)

34
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,672
So when we're talking about authenticity,

35
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:45,134
it's a little more fractal than it appears
and that's a good example to show it.

36
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:49,115
I tried to pick four problems
that will frame the issue properly.

37
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,663
So the first problem, I thought,

38
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,215
Chip and PIN, right?

39
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,729
[Banks and legacies
bringing down the system from within]

[Offline solutions do not work online]

41
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,217
I'm guessing everyone's got
a chip and PIN card, right?

42
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,983
So why is that a good example?

43
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,458
That's the example of how
legacy thinking about identity

44
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,376
subverts the security
of a well-constructed system.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,167
That chip and PIN card
that's in your pocket

46
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,409
has a little chip on it
that cost millions of pounds to develop,

47
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,986
is extremely secure,

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,249
you can put scanning
electron microscopes on it,

49
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,425
you can try and grind it down,
blah blah blah.

50
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:20,914
Those chips have never been broken,
whatever you read in the paper.

51
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:24,148
And for a joke,
we take that super-secure chip

52
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:27,662
and we bond it to a trivially
counterfeitable magnetic stripe

53
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:31,284
and for very lazy criminals,
we still emboss the card.

54
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:34,791
So if you're a criminal in a hurry
and you need to copy someone's card,

55
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,992
you can just stick a piece of paper on it
and rub a pencil over it

56
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,875
just to sort of speed things up.

57
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,971
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card too,

58
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,362
we print the name and the SALT code
and everything else on the front too.

59
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:47,701
Why?

60
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:51,810
There is no earthly reason why your name
is printed on a chip and PIN card.

61
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,445
And if you think about it,

62
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,563
it's even more insidious and perverse
than it seems at first.

63
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,377
Because the only people that benefit

64
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,951
from having the name
on the card are criminals.

65
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,592
You know what your name is, right?

66
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,493
(Laughter)

67
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,745
And when you go into
a shop and buy something,

68
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,705
it's a PIN, he doesn't care
what the name is.

69
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,364
The only place where you ever have
to write your name on the back

70
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:12,534
is in America at the moment.

71
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,745
And whenever I go to America,

72
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,545
and I have to pay with a mag stripe
on the back of the card,

73
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,427
I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,

74
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,235
just as a security mechanism,

75
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,473
because if a transaction
ever gets disputed,

76
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,450
and it comes back and it says Dave Birch,

77
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,189
I know it must have been a criminal,

78
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,024
because I would never sign it Dave Birch.

79
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,714
(Laughter)

80
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:31,505
So if you drop your card in the street,

81
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,277
it means a criminal
can pick it up and read it.

82
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:33,982
They know the name,

83
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,911
from the name they can find the address,

84
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,326
and then they can go off
and buy stuff online.

85
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,538
Why do we put the name on the card?

86
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:44,257
Because we think identity
is something to do with names,

87
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,952
and because we're rooted
in the idea of the identity card,

88
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:49,068
which obsesses us.

89
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,664
And I know it crashed and burned
a couple of years ago,

90
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:56,219
but if you're someone in politics
or the home office or whatever,

91
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:57,624
and you think about identity,

92
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:00,839
you can only think of identity
in terms of cards with names on them.

93
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,985
And that's very subversive
in a modern world.

94
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,241
So the second example I thought I'd use

95
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,307
is chatrooms.

00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,590
I like that picture for the moment.

00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,565
Why do I use that picture?

106

Because that was very interesting,
watching that experience as an old person.

107
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,097
So him and his friends,

108
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,975
they get together, they booked a room,
like a church hall,

109
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,825
and they got all their friends
who had bands,

110
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,135
and they got them together,

111
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,636
and they do it all on Facebook,

112
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,434
and then they sell tickets,
and the first band on the -

113
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,319
I was going to say "menu,"

114
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,629
that's probably
the wrong word for it, isn't it?

115
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,559
The first band on the list of bands

116
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:54,116

public music performance of some kind

00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,285
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

118
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,105
then the next band gets the next 20,

119
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,091
and so on.

120
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:00,427
They were at the bottom of the menu,

121
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,545
they were like fifth,
I thought they had no chance.

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,807
He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

123
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,904
But my point is,
that all worked perfectly,

124
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:09,685
except on the web.

125
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,878
So they're sitting on Facebook,

126
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:14,744
and they're sending these messages
and arranging things

127
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,063
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

128
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,694
That's the big problem
we're trying to solve.

129
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,661
If only they were using the real names,

130
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,352
Then you wouldn't be worried
about them on the Internet.

131
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:24,597
And so when he says to me,

132
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:28,963
"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom
to talk about guitars" or something,

133
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:32,212
I'm like, "oh, well,
I don't want you to go into a chatroom

134
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,570
to talk about guitars, because
they might not all be your friends,

135
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:37,833
and some of the people
that are in the chatroom

136
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:41,390
might be perverts and teachers
and vicars."

137
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,215
(Laughter)

138
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,144
I mean, they generally are,
when you look in the paper, right?

139
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:49,200
So I want to know who
all the people in the chatroom are.

140
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,939
So okay, you can go in the chatroom,

141
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:53,963
but only if everybody in the chatroom
is using their real names,

142
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,328
and they submit full copies
of their police report.

143
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:01,448
But of course, if anybody
in the chatroom asked for his real name,

144
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,690
I'd say no.
You can't give them your real name.

145
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:06,390
Because what happens
if they turn out to be perverts,

146
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:09,063
and teachers and whatever.

147
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,802
So you have this odd sort of paradox

148
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,133
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space

149
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,075
if I know who everybody else is,

150
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,438
but I don't want anybody else
to know who he is.

151
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,614
And so you get
this sort of logjam around identity

152
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,250
where you want full disclosure
from everybody else,

153
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:22,545
but not from yourself.

154
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,552
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

155
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,862
And so the chatroom thing
doesn't work properly,

156
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:31,227
and it's a very bad way
of thinking about identity.

157
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:34,162
So on my RSS feed,
I saw this thing about -

158
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,758
I just said something bad
about my RSS feed, didn't I?

159
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:38,513
I should stop saying it like that.

160
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:40,046
For some random reason, I can't imagine,

161
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,202
something about cheerleaders
turned up in my inbox.

162
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,179
And I read this story about cheerleaders,

163
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,628
and it's a fascinating story.

164
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,843
This happened a couple of years ago
in the U.S.

165
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,568
There were some cheerleaders
in a team at a high school

166
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,451
in the U.S., and they said mean things

167
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:54,637
about their cheerleading coach,

168
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,848
as I'm sure kids do
about all of their teachers

169
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,175
all of the time,

170
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,255
and somehow the cheerleading coach
found out about this.

171
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,719
She was very upset.

172
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,886
And so she went to one of the girls,
and said,

173
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,006
"you have to give me
your Facebook password."

174
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,695
I read this all the time,
where even at some universities

175
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:10,595
and places of education,

176
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:12,324
kids are forced to hand over
their Facebook passwords.

177
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,079
So you've got to give them
your Facebook password.

178
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:15,952
She was a kid!

179
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,138
What she should have said

180
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,368
is, "my lawyer will be calling you

181
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:19,158
first thing in the morning.

182
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,279
It's an outrageous imposition

183
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:23,138
on my 4th Amendment right to privacy,

184
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:23,923
and you're going to be sued

185
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:24,518
for all the money you've got."

186
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:25,574
That's what she should have said.

187
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:26,553
But she's a kid,

188
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,372
so she hands over the password.

189
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,422
The teacher can't log into Facebook,

190
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,594
because the school
has blocked access to Facebook.

191
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,507
So the teacher can't log into Facebook
until she gets home.

192
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,205
So the girl tells her friends,

193
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:37,766
guess what happened?

194
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,362
The teacher logged in, she knows.

195
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:41,203
So the girls just all logged into Facebook
on their phones,

196
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,070
and deleted their profiles.

197
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,955
And so when the teacher logged in,
there was nothing there.

198
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:51,607
My point is, those identities,
they don't think about them the same way.

199
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:55,336
Identity is, especially when
you're a teenager, a fluid thing.

200
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,941
You have lots of identities.

201
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,191
And you can have an identity,
you don't like it,

202
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:02,787
because it's subverted in some way,
or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,

203
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:04,869
you just delete it and get another one.

204
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:08,193
The idea that you have an identity
that's given to you by someone,

205
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,012
the government or whatever,

206
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:11,131
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places,

207
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,839
that's absolutely wrong.

208
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:15,871
Why would you want to really know
who someone was on Facebook,

209
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,753
unless you wanted to abuse them
and harass them in some way?

210
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,384
And it just doesn't work properly.

211
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,598
And my fourth example is
there are some cases

212
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,031
where you really want to be -

213
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,601
In case you're wondering,
that's me at the G20 protest.

214
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,277
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,
but I had a meeting at a bank

215
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,710
on the day of the G20 protest,
and I got an email from the bank

216
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:41,271
saying please don't wear a suit,
because it'll inflame the protesters.

217
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,045
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

218
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,735
so you can see why it would drive them

219
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,236
into an anti-capitalist frenzy.

220
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,771
(Laughter)

221
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:47,700
So I thought, well, look.

222
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:50,869
If I don't want to inflame the protesters,

223
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:51,785
the obvious thing to do

224
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,190
is go dressed as a protester.

225
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:55,208
So I went dressed completely in black,

226
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:57,092
you know, with a black balaclava,

227
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:57,926
I had black gloves on,

228
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,563
but I've taken them off
to sign the visitor's book.

229
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,135
(Laughter)

230
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,318
I'm wearing black trousers, black boots,

231
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,724
I'm dressed completely in black.

232
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:04,898
I go into the bank at 10 o'clock,

233
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,863
go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

234
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,139
I've got a 3 o'clock
with so and so there."

235
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:08,580
Sure. They sign me in.

236
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:11,351
There's my visitor's badge.

237
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,242
(Laughter)

238
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,560
So this nonsense

239
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,614
about you've got to have real names
on Facebook and whatever,

240
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,849
that gets you that kind of security.

241
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:22,368
That gets you security theater,
where there's no actual security,

242
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,706
but people are sort of playing parts
in a play about security.

243
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,831
And as long as
everybody learns their lines,

244
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,367
everyone's happy.

245
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:31,231
But it's not real security.

246
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:34,473
Especially because I hate banks
more than the G20 protesters do,

247
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,658
because I work for them.

248
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,485
I know that things are actually worse
than these guys think.

249
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,282
(Laughter)

250
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,942
But suppose I worked
next to somebody in a bank

251
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,974
who was doing something.

252
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:58,910
Suppose I was sitting
next to a rogue trader,

253
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:01,213
and I want to report it
to the boss of the bank.

254
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,629
So I log on to do
a little bit of whistleblowing.

255
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,094
I send a message,
this guy's a rogue trader.

256
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:06,892
That message is meaningless

257
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,840
if you don't know
that I'm a trader at the bank.

258
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,769
If that message just comes from anybody,

259
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,426
it has zero information value.

260
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,919
There's no point in sending that message.

261
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:21,206
But if I have to prove who I am,

262
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,611
I'll never send that message.

263
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,464
It's just like the nurse in the hospital
reporting the drunk surgeon.

264
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:29,385
That message will only happen
if I'm anonymous.

265
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:34,176
So the system has to have ways
of providing anonymity there,

266
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,439
otherwise we don't get
where we want to get to.

267
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:39,109
So four issues.
So what are we going to do about it?

268
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:43,796
Well, what we tend to do about it

269
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,184
is we think about Orwell space.

270
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,330
And we try to make electronic versions

271
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:51,637
of the identity card
that we got rid of in 1953.

272
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:54,394
So we think if we had a card,

273
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,733
call it a Facebook login,

274
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:57,030
which proves who you are,

275
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,921
and I make you carry it all the time,

276
00:10:58,945 --> 00:10:59,739
that solves the problem.

277
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,897
And of course, for all those reasons
I've just outlined,

278
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:02,889
it doesn't, and it might, actually,

279
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,961
make some problems worse.

280
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:06,784
The more times you're forced
to use your real identity,

281
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,024
certainly in transactional terms,

282
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,906
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.

283
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,170
The goal is to stop people
from using identity

284
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,347
in transactions which don't need identity,

285
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,856
which is actually almost all transactions.

286
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,153
Almost all of the transactions you do

287
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,841
are not, who are you?

288
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,975
They're, are you allowed to drive the car,

289
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,523
are you allowed in the building,

290
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:27,380
are you over 18,

291
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:29,495
etcetera, etcetera.

292
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,326
So my suggestion-I, like James,

293
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,487
think that there should be
a resurgence of interest in R &amp; D.

294
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:35,272
I think this is a solvable problem.

295
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,092
It's something we can do about.

296
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,040
Naturally, in these circumstances,

297
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,414
I turn to Doctor Who.

298
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,550
Because in this,

299
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,194
as in so many other walks of life,

300
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,147
Doctor Who has already shown
us the answer.

301
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:47,961
So I should say,

302
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,292
for some of our foreign visitors,

303
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:54,146
Doctor Who is the greatest
living scientist in England,

304
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,723
(Laughter)

305
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,523
and a beacon of truth and enlightenment
to all of us.

306
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:02,593
And this is Doctor Who
with his psychic paper.

307
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,763
Come on, you guys must have seen
Doctor Who's psychic paper.

308
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,763
You're not nerds if you say yes.

309
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:08,899
Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?

310
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:11,329
Oh right, you were in the library
the whole time studying I guess.

311
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,399
Is that what you're going to tell us?

312
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,661
Doctor Who's psychic paper

313
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,781
is when you hold up the psychic paper,

314
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,319
the person, in their brain,

315
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:20,668
sees the thing that they need to see.

316
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:23,027
So I want to show you a British passport,

317
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:24,053
I hold up the psychic paper,

318
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,533
you see a British passport.

319
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:27,329
I want to get into a party,

320
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,936
I hold up the psychic paper,

321
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,389
I show you a party invitation.

322
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,464
You see what you want to see.

323
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:35,679
So what I'm saying is we need
to make an electronic version of that,

324
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:37,876
but with one tiny, tiny change,

325
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,472
which is that it'll only show you
the British passport

326
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:41,688
if I've actually got one.

327
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:42,907
It'll only show you the party invitation

328
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,304
if I actually have one.

329
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,328
It will only show you that I'm over 18
if I actually am over 18.

330
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,652
But nothing else.

331
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:54,427
So you're the bouncer at the pub,
you need to know that I'm over 18,

332
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,451
instead of showing you my driving license,

333
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,292
which shows you I know how to drive,

334
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:00,888
what my name is, my address,
all these kind of things,

335
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:02,467
I show you my psychic paper,

336
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,633
and all it tells you is
am I over 18 or not.

337
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:07,069
Right.

338
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:08,407
Is that just a pipe dream?

339
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,100
Of course not, otherwise
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

340
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:13,184
So in order to build that
and make it work,

341
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,955
I'm only going to name these things,
I'll not go into them,

342
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,132
we need a plan,

343
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:18,381
which is we're going to build this

344
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:20,405
as an infrastructure for everybody to use,

345
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,259
to solve all of these problems.

346
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,307
We're going to make a utility,

347
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,855
the utility has to be universal,

348
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,738
you can use it everywhere,

349
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,953
I'm just giving you little flashes
of the technology as we go along.

350
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,336
That's a Japanese ATM,

351
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,444
the fingerprint template
is stored inside the mobile phone.

352
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:35,431
So when you want to draw money out,

353
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:36,928
you put the mobile phone on the ATM,

354
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,193
and touch your finger,

355
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,265
your fingerprint goes through
to the phone,

356
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,956
the phone says yes, that's whoever,

357
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,160
and the ATM then gives you some money.

358
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:47,197
It has to be a utility
that you can use everywhere.

359
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,983
It has to be absolutely convenient,

360
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:52,150
that's me going into the pub.

361
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:54,943
All the device on the door
of the pub is allowed is,

362
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,616
is this person over 18
and not barred from the pub?

363
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,946
And so the idea is,
you touch your ID card to the door,

364
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,905
and if I am allowed in,
it shows my picture,

365
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,366
if I'm not allowed in,
it shows a red cross.

366
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,981
It doesn't disclose any other information.

367
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,893
It has to have no special gadgets.

368
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,528
That can only mean one thing,

369
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,219
following on from Ross's statement,

370
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,697
which I agree with completely.

371
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:14,809
If it means no special gadgets,

372
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,183
it has to run on a mobile phone.

373
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,286
That's the only choice we have,

374
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,165
we have to make it work on mobile phones.

375
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,099
There are 6,6 billion

376
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,023
mobile phone subscriptions.

377
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:23,059
My favorite statistic of all time,

378
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,036
only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.

379
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,095
That means something,

380
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,352
I don't know what.

381
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:27,730
(Laughter)

382
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:31,193
I rely on our futurologists to tell me.

383
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,903
It has to be a utility
which is extensible.

384
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,188
So it has to be something

385
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,778
that anybody could build on.

386
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:37,666
Anybody should be able
to use this infrastructure,

387
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,120
you don't need permissions,
licenses, whatever,

388
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:43,311
anyone should be able
to write some code to do this.

389
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,417
You know what symmetry is,

390
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,764
so you don't need a picture of it.

391
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,928
This is how we're going to do it.

392
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:50,962
We're going to do it using phones,

393
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:51,588
and we're going to do it

394
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:52,744
using mobile proximity.

395
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,880
I'm going to suggest to you

396
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,216
the technology to implement

397
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,502
Doctor Who's psychic paper

398
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,146
is already here, and if any of you

399
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,625
have got one of the new
Barclay's debit cards

400
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,854
with the contactless interface on it,

401
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,545
you've already got that technology.

402
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,469
If you've ever been up to the big city,

403
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,970
and used an Oyster card at all,

404
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:09,065
does that ring any bells to anybody?

405
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:09,811
The technology already exists.

406
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:11,201
The first phones

407
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:11,831
that have the technology built in,

408
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,130
the Google Nexus, the S2,

409
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:14,839
the Samsung Wifi 7,9,

410
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:16,331
the first phones that have

411
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:17,423
the technology built into them

412
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:18,257
are already in the shops.

413
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:19,969
So the idea that the gas man

414
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:22,161
can turn up at my mom's door

415
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,363
and he can show my mom his phone,

416
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,698
and she can tap it with her phone,

417
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:28,005
and it will come up with green
if he really is from British Gas

418
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,217
and allowed in,

419
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,887
and it'll come up with red if he isn't,

420
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:31,497
end of story.

421
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,347
We have the technology to do that.

422
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,582
And what's more,

423
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,727
although some of those things
sounded a bit counter-intuitive,

424
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,515
like proving I'm over 18
without proving who I am,

425
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,740
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,

426
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,969
it's extremely well-known
and well-understood.

427
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,624
Digital signatures, the blinding
of public key certificates,

428
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,368
these technologies have been around
for a while,

429
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,440
we've just had no way
of packaging them up.

430
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:53,157
So the technology already exists.

431
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:56,845
We know it works,

432
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,593
There are a few examples
of the technology being used

433
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:00,263
in experimental places.

434
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,591
That's London Fashion Week,

435
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,465
where we built a system with O2,

436
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:06,232
that's for the Wireless Festival
in Hyde Park,

437
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,355
you can see the persons

438
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,116
walking in with their VIP band,

439
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,600
it's just being checked

440
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:10,700
by the Nokia phone
that's reading the band.

441
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:12,398
I'm only putting those up to show you

442
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,627
these things are prosaic,

443
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:15,509
this stuff works in these environments.

444
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,962
They don't need to be special.

445
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:22,881
So finally, I know that you can do this,

446
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,669
because if you saw
the episode of Doctor Who,

447
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,569
the Easter special of Doctor Who,

448
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:31,945
where he went to Mars in a bus,

449
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,507
I should say again
for our foreign students,

450
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,180
that doesn't happen every episode.

451
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,651
This was a very special case.

452
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:39,892
So in the episode where
he goes to Mars in a London bus,

453
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,565
I can't show you the clip,

454
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,589
due to the outrageous restrictions
of Queen Anne-style copyright

455
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,482
by the BBC,

456
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,221
but in the episode
where he goes to Mars in a London bus,

457
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:53,355
Doctor Who is clearly shown
getting on to the bus

458
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,655
with the Oyster card reader

459
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,223
using his psychic paper.

460
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,315
Which proves that psychic paper

461
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,030
has an MSE interface.

462
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:02,064
Thank you very much.
