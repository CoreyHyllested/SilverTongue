00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,296
When you come to TEDx,
you always think about technology,

1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,656
the world changing,
becoming more innovative.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,456
You think about the driverless.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,896
Everyone's talking
about driverless cars these days,

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,016
and I love the concept
of a driverless car,

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,536
but when I go in one, you know,

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,480
I want it really slow,

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,720
I want access to the steering wheel
and the brake, just in case.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,240
I don't know about you,
but I am not ready for a driverless bus.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,320
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,560
How about a driverless world?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,480
And I ask you that

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,080
because we are increasingly in one.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,776
It's not supposed to be that way.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,576
We're number one,

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,496
the United States is large and in charge.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,336
Americanization and globalization
for the last several generations

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,016
have basically been the same thing.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,856
Right? Whether it's
the World Trade Organization

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,216
or it's the IMF, the World Bank,

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,076
the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,856
these were American institutions,

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,496
our values, our friends, our allies,
our money, our standards.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,600
That was the way the world worked.

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,176
So it's sort of interesting,
if you want to look at how the US looks,

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,416
here it is.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,736
This is our view of how the world is run.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,576
President Obama has got the red carpet,

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,416
he goes down Air Force One,

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,976
and it feels pretty good,
it feels pretty comfortable.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,616
Well, I don't know how many of you
saw the China trip last week

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,696
and the G20.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,936
Oh my God. Right?

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,616
This is how we landed

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,136
for the most important meeting
of the world's leaders in China.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,136
The National Security Advisor
was actually spewing expletives

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,976
on the tarmac --

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,416
no red carpet,

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,096
kind of left out the bottom of the plane

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,920
along with all the media
and everybody else.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,896
Later on in the G20,

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
well, there's Obama.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,696
(Laughter)

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,336
Hi, George.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Hi, Norman.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,216
They look like they're
about to get into a cage match, right?

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,336
And they did. It was 90 minutes long,
and they talked about Syria.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,256
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,016
He's increasingly calling the shots.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,656
He's the one willing to do stuff there.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,856
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,736
but it's not as if the Americans
are telling him what to do.

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,096
How about when the whole 20
are getting together?

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,073
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,

54
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,176
then the Americans
are pulling their weight.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,616
Uh-oh.

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
(Laughter)

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,856
Xi Jinping seems fine.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,776
Angela Merkel has -- she always does --

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,176
that look, she always does that.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,216
But Putin is telling
Turkish president Erdogan what to do,

61
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,840
and Obama is like,
what's going on over there?

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,176
You see. And the problem is
it's not a G20,

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,416
the problem is

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,416
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,856
a world order where there is
no single country or alliance

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,256
that can meet the challenges
of global leadership.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
The G20 doesn't work,

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
the G7, all of our friends,
that's history.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,376
So globalization is continuing.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,056
Goods and services and people
and capital are moving across borders

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,096
faster and faster than ever before,

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,160
but Americanization is not.

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,456
So if I've convinced you of that,

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,216
I want to do two things
with the rest of this talk.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,696
I want to talk
about the implications of that

76
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,976
for the whole world.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,536
I'll go around it.

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,176
And then I want to talk about

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,096
what we think right here

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,536
in the United States and in New York.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,176
So why? What are the implications.
Why are we here?

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,016
Well, we're here

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,416
because the United States,

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,256
we spent two trillion dollars
on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,496
that were failed.

86
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,136
We don't want to do that anymore.

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,816
We have large numbers
of middle and working classes

88
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,936
that feel like they've not benefited
from promises of globalization,

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
so they don't want to see it particularly.

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,296
And we have an energy revolution

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,496
where we don't need OPEC
or the Middle East the way we used to.

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,976
We produce all that right here
in the United States.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,336
So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,656
or the architect of global trade.

95
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,096
The Americans don't want to even be
the cheerleader of global values.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,776
Well, then you look to Europe,

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,896
and the most important
alliance in the world

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,656
has been the transatlantic relationship.

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,056
But it is now weaker than it has been
at any point since World War II,

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,656
all of the crises,
the Brexit conversations,

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,776
the hedging going on
between the French and the Russians,

102
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
or the Germans and the Turks,
or the Brits and the Chinese.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,936
China does want to do more leadership.

104
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,976
They do, but only in the economic sphere,

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,096
and they want their own values,
standards, currency,

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,216
in competition with that of the US.

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,176
The Russians want to do more leadership.

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,256
You see that in Ukraine,

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,136
in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,896
but not with the Americans.

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,536
They want their own preferences and order.

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,456
That's why we are where we are.

113
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,776
So what happens going forward?

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,936
Let's start easy,

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
with the Middle East.

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,880
(Laughter)

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,176
You know, I left a little out,

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,536
but you get the general idea.

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,976
Look, there are three reasons

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,056
why the Middle East
has had stability such as it is. Right?

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,176
One is because there was
a willingness to provide

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,576
some level of military security
by the US and allies.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,256
Number two, it was easy to take
a lot of cheap money out of the ground

124
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,056
because oil was expensive.

125
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,416
And number three

126
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,536
was no matter how bad the leaders were,
the populations were relatively quiescent.

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,336
They didn't have the ability,
and many didn't have the will

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,816
to really rise up against.

129
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,376
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,

130
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,016
all three of those things
are increasingly not true,

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,376
and so failed states,

132
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,616
terrorism, refugees and the rest.

133
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,576
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?

134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,456
No, the Kurds will do better,
and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.

135
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,856
But generally speaking,
it's not a good look.

136
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,256
OK, how about this guy?

137
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,736
He's playing a poor hand very well.

138
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,656
There's no question
he's hitting above his weight.

139
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,936
But long term -- I didn't mean that.

140
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,256
But long term, long term,

141
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,936
if you think that the Russians

142
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,576
were antagonized by the US and Europe
expanding NATO right up to their borders

143
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,246
when we said they weren't going to,

144
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,656
and the EU encroaching them,

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,136
just wait until the Chinese
put hundreds of billions of dollars

146
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,296
in every country around Russia
they thought they had influence in.

147
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,976
The Chinese are going to dominate it.
The Russians are picking up the crumbs.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,360
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be
a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.

149
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,696
It's not all bad. Right?

150
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,976
Asia actually looks a lot better.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,176
There are real leaders across Asia,

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,576
they have a lot of political stability.

153
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,856
They're there for a while.

154
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,136
Mr. Modi in India,

155
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,136
Mr. Abe, who is probably
about to get a third term written in

156
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,136
in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,

157
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,296
of course Xi Jinping
who is consolidating enormous power,

158
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,656
the most powerful leader in China

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,336
since Mao.

160
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,576
Those are the three
most important economies in Asia.

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,416
Now look, there are problems in Asia.

162
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,096
We see the sparring
over the South China Sea.

163
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,816
We see that Kim Jong Un,
just in the last couple of days,

164
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,016
tested yet another nuclear weapon.

165
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,296
But the leaders in Asia
do not feel the need

166
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,856
to wave the flag,

167
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,696
to go xenophobic,

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,776
to actually allow escalation

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,296
of the geopolitical
and cross-border tensions.

170
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,696
They want to focus on long-term
economic stability and growth.

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
And that's what they're actually doing.

172
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
Let's turn to Europe.

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,896
Europe does look a little scared
in this environment.

174
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,216
So much of what is happening
in the Middle East

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,976
is washing up quite literally
onto European shores.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,775
You see Brexit and you see
the concerns of populism

177
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,376
across all of the European states.

178
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,056
Let me tell you that over the long term,

179
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,856
in a G-Zero world,

180
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,600
European expansion
will be seen to have gone too far.

181
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,296
Europe went right up to Russia,
went right down to the Middle East,

182
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,576
and if the world were truly becoming
more flat and more Americanized,

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,176
that would be less of a problem,

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,696
but in a G-Zero world,
those countries nearest Russia

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,336
and nearest the Middle East

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,736
actually have different
economic capabilities,

187
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,576
different social stability

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,776
and different political preferences
and systems than core Europe.

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,816
So Europe was able to truly expand

190
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,896
under the G7,

191
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,456
but under the G-Zero,
Europe will get smaller.

192
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,496
Core Europe around Germany
and France and others

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,576
will still work, be functional,
stable, wealthy, integrated.

194
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,016
But the periphery,

195
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,496
countries like Greece
and Turkey and others,

196
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,920
will not look that good at all.

197
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,576
Latin America, a lot of populism,

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,616
made the economies not go so well.

199
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,496
They had been more opposed
to the United States for decades.

200
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,456
Increasingly, they're coming back.

201
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,136
We see that in Argentina.

202
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,896
We see it with the openness in Cuba.

203
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,136
We will see it in Venezuela
when Maduro falls.

204
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,176
We will see it in Brazil
after the impeachment

205
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,080
and when we finally see
a new legitimate president elected there.

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,816
The only place you see
that is moving in another direction

207
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,416
is the unpopularity
of Mexican president Peña Nieto.

208
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,296
There you could actually see
a slip away from the United States

209
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,576
over the coming years.

210
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,616
The US election matters a lot
on that one, too.

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,960
(Laughter)

212
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,416
Africa, right?

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,656
A lot of people have said
it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.

214
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,216
In a G-Zero world,
it is absolutely an amazing time

215
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,976
for a few African countries,

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,656
those governed well
with a lot of urbanization,

217
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,176
a lot of smart people,
women really getting into the workforce,

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,176
entrepreneurship taking off.

219
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,976
But for most of the countries in Africa,

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,896
it's going to be a lot more dicey:

221
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,936
extreme climate conditions,

222
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,176
radicalism both from Islam
and also Christianity,

223
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,616
very poor governance,

224
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,656
borders you can't defend,
lots of forced migration.

225
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,776
Those countries can fall off the map.

226
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,536
So you're really going to see
an extreme segregation going on

227
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,896
between the winners
and the losers across Africa.

228
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,816
Finally, back to the United States.

229
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,456
What do I think about us?

230
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,216
Because there are a lot of upset people,

231
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,896
not here at TEDx, I know,

232
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,696
but in the United States, my God,

233
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,176
after 15 months of campaigning,
we should be upset.

234
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,176
I understand that.

235
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,456
But a lot of people are upset
because they say, "Washington's broken,

236
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,976
we don't trust the establishment,
we hate the media."

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,136
Heck, even globalists like me
are taking it on the chin.

238
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,776
Look, I do think we have to recognize,

239
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,016
my fellow campers,

240
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,456
that when you are being
chased by the bear,

241
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,776
in the global context,
you need not outrun the bear,

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,416
you need to only outrun
your fellow campers.

243
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,520
(Laughter)

244
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,856
Now, I just told you

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,976
about our fellow campers.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,936
Right? And from that perspective,

247
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,976
we look OK.

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,016
A lot of people in that context say,

249
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,536
"Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.

250
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,616
Let's send our kids
to American universities."

251
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,776
You know, our neighbors are awesome:

252
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,656
Canada, Mexico
and two big bodies of water.

253
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,056
You know how much Turkey
would love to have neighbors like that?

254
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,160
Those are awesome neighbors.

255
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,696
Terrorism is a problem
in the United States.

256
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,016
God knows we know it here in New York.

257
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,517
But it's a much bigger problem
in Europe than the US.

258
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,856
It's a much bigger problem
in the Middle East

259
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,456
than it is in Europe.

260
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,616
These are factors of large magnitude.

261
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,616
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,
and we're complaining bitterly about it.

262
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,456
You know why?
Because they can't swim here.

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,176
Right? I mean, the Turks would love
to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.

264
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,496
The Jordanians,
the Germans, the Brits. Right?

265
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,776
That's not the situation.

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,976
That's the reality of the United States.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,560
Now, that sounds pretty good.

268
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,576
Here's the challenge.

269
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,680
In a G-Zero world, the way you lead

270
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,216
is by example.

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,256
If we know we don't want to be
the global cop anymore,

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,233
if we know we're not going to be
the architect of global trade,

273
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,856
we're not going to be
the cheerleader of global values,

274
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,976
we're not going to do it
the way we used to,

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,381
the 21st century is changing,

276
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:39,256
we need to lead by example --
be so compelling

277
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,696
that all these other people
are going to still say,

278
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,536
it's not just they're faster campers.

279
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,656
Even when the bear is not chasing us,
this is a good place to be.

280
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,040
We want to emulate them.

281
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,320
The election process this year
is not proving a good option

282
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,720
for leading by example.

283
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,096
Hillary Clinton says
it's going to be like the '90s.

284
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,056
We can still be
that cheerleader on values.

285
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,576
We can still be
the architect of global trade.

286
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,296
We can still be the global sheriff.

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,400
And Donald Trump wants
to bring us back to the '30s.

288
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,496
He's saying, "Our way or the highway.
You don't like it, lump it." Right?

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,376
Neither are recognizing
a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,

290
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,176
which is that even though
the US is not in decline,

291
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,736
it is getting objectively harder

292
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,936
for the Americans to impose their will,

293
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,656
even have great influence,

294
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
on the global order.

295
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,176
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?

296
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,256
What would we have to do to fix this

297
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,496
after November,

298
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,696
after the next president comes in?

299
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,376
Well, either we have to have
another crisis that forces us to respond.

300
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,056
A depression would do that.

301
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,256
Another global financial
crisis could do this.

302
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,296
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.

303
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,776
Or, absent crisis,

304
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,936
we need to see that the hollowing out,
the inequality, the challenges

305
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,336
that are growing and growing
in the United States,

306
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,536
are themselves urgent enough

307
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,896
to force our leaders to change,

308
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,376
and that we have those voices.

309
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,296
Through our cell phones, individually,

310
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,400
we have those voices
to compel them to change.

311
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
There is, of course, a third choice,

312
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,176
perhaps the most likely one,

313
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,896
which is that we do
neither of those things,

314
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,496
and in four years time you invite me back,

315
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
and I will give this speech yet again.

316
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,176
Thank you very, very much.

317
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,085
(Applause)
