0
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a great honor to be here with you.

1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The good news is

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
(Laughter)

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but I have a box of slides.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've learned through experience

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The whole story really starts

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And on a Wednesday afternoon,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was walking down the corridor of my high school

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
who made a great big old ceramic vessel,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic --

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, I walked in the art room and I said, "What is that?"

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And he said, "Ceramics. And who are you?"

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I said, "I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that."

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you."

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And so for the remaining two years of my high school,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I cut all my classes.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
(Laughter)

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I had the presence of mind

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
(Laughter)

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and they gave me passing grades.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And that's how I got out of high school.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And Mr. Ross said,

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
"You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me."

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I'm now a trustee of the university,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and at my installation ceremony I said,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
"I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
who got into the place on probation.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't give up on the poor kids, because you never know

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
what's going to happen to those children in life."

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
with the highest crime rate.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, we don't make any steel anymore,

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and the people who used to make the steel

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
are having a very tough time of it.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I rebuild them and give them new life.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was adopted

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and he donated a row house. And in that row house

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
there's money in very close proximity.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
(Laughter)

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And last year I spoke at his memorial service

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and wished him well in this life.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and I asked him to build me a world class center

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited --

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's the building.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My view is that if you want to involve yourself

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
in the life of people who have been given up on,

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you have to look like the solution and not the problem.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
(Laughter)

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and it sets an attitude and expectation

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, from that fountain I built this building.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
because I raised all the money.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
(Laughter)

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I said to my boy, "When you raise the money,

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we'll put your taste on the wall."

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and everywhere your eye turns,

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
there's something beautiful looking back at you,

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that's deliberate.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's intentional.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In my view, it is this kind of world

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that can redeem the soul of poor people.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We also created a boardroom,

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have since spun him off into his own business.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and single parents deserved to come to a school

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
long before you give them the speech.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Those are real and they're in my building every day.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And now that I've given lots of speeches,

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and they said, "Mr. Strickland,

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
what an extraordinary story and what a great school.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And we were particularly touched by the flowers

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there."

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What you need to know is that the children

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and the adults deserve flowers in their life.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
we believe in hope and human possibilities.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That happens to be at Christmas time.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that was built by the Heinz company -- you've heard of them?

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They did all right in the ketchup business.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I happen to know that company pretty well

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator --

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
who was tragically killed in a plane accident --

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
he had heard about my desire to build a new building,

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And he called me into his office --

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
(Laughter) --

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And he said, "But we've heard about you.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you could do us a great service

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
if you would add a culinary program to your program."

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because back then, we were building a trades program.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
for the Heinz company."

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that I don't know much about, but I promise you

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and in a couple of years, I'll come back

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and weigh out that program that you desire."

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
"Well, what would your reaction be

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
if I said I'd give you a million dollars?"

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I said, "Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business."

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
(Laughter)

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And most importantly,

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And we've never looked back.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I would like to show you now some of the food

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That happens to be our cafeteria line.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's puff pastry day. Why?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because the students made puff pastry

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and that's what the school ate every day.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That good food's not for rich people --

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
good food's for everybody on the planet,

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but it's better for their heads.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that they have value at this place I call my center.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
by creating a world class environment,

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
if you treat them in that way.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
after six months in the training program.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's all in the way that you think about people

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that often determines their behavior.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That was done by a student after seven months in the program,

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
done by a very brilliant young woman

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
who was taught by our pastry chef.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
(Laughter)

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They have no calories.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's our dining room.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It looks like your average high school cafeteria

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
in your average town in America.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
particularly once they have been pushed aside.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we train medical technicians for the medical industry,

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and we train chemical technicians for companies

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and you're all invited --

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
with logarithmic calculators

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
10 months from enrolling in the program.

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There is absolutely no reason why poor people

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
can't learn world class technology.

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We even teach people how to read.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
he's now an instructor.

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And so you must ask yourself the question:

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
how is it possible in the 21st century

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that we graduate children from schools

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can take these children and in 20 weeks,

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No big deal.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's our library with more handcrafted furniture.

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And this is the arts program I started in 1968.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Remember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
with other kids in the neighborhood,

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you can bring them right back to life.

247
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that come to me every day of the week for arts education.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And these are children who are flunking out of public school.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We've made a fascinating discovery:

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
there's nothing wrong with the kids

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and Herbie's music can't cure.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I beat out all the Ph.D.'s

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
because I figured that if you treat children like human beings,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And why we can't institute that policy

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
in every school and in every city and every town

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
remains a mystery to me.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me show you what these people do.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists --

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there --

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and what we've learned

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
is that the children will become like the people who teach them.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
an African-American woman

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and let me show you what they did with the work.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
These were children who the whole world had given up on,

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
who were flunking out of public school,

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and that's what they're capable of doing

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We teach photography.

279
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And these are examples of some of the kids' work.

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That boy won a four-year scholarship

281
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
on the strength of that photograph.

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is our gallery.

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We have a world class gallery

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so I designed this thing.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We have smoked salmon at the art openings,

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
we have a formal printed invitation,

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He was dragging guys out of bars

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and saving those lives for the Lord.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but keep the enthusiasm.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't get these parents to come to the school."

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He said, "I'll get them to come to the school."

299
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
"Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but you probably didn't have a ride.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So, I came to give you a ride."

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and we didn't pick up one parent.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up

307
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
because people think you're bad parents.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And there is no statistical difference

310
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
between the white parents and the black parents.

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
every time, every town, every city.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
they've got four shows on their resume

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
before they apply to college because it's all up here.

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You have to change the way that people see themselves

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
before you can change their behavior.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And it's worked out pretty good up to this day.

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is brand new.

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and I did all right.

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And the woman came out of the audience,

326
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
she said, "That was a great story

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and I was very impressed with your presentation.

328
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old."

329
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?"

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?"

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
She said, "Yes, sir."

333
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem."

334
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and a furniture company called Steelcase

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and all their furniture for the United States of America.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And that's the room

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
that's initiating the relationship.

340
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We got it just done in time to show you,

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
(Applause)

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
(Music)

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I only have a couple more slides,

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.

346
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.

348
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall

349
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
on the north end of the building while I was building it.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,

354
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
"Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that doesn't even have a reputation in music?"

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He said, "Because I heard you built the center

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And now that I have, I want to give you a gift."

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I said, "You're the gift."

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And I'm going to allow you to record the concert

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and I'm going to give you the music,

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement

365
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that says the money will come back and support the school."

366
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,

367
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And he showed up and said,

369
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
"Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,

370
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and I want to help you."

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then a bass player named Ray Brown,

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,

374
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,

376
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and a fellow named Tito Puente,

377
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.

381
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I have now accumulated 600 recordings

383
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
of the greatest artists in the world,

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
including Joe Williams, who died,

385
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
but not before his last recording was done at my school.

386
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and he said, "God's picked you, man, to do this work.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And I want my music to be with you."

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And that worked out all right.

390
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
they voted to give me the rights to the music.

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony

394
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because I didn't think we were going to win.

395
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, we did win,

396
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.

397
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios

400
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in the United States of America

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
(Laughter)

402
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's the place all filled up with Republicans.

404
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
(Laughter)

405
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
(Applause)

406
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,

407
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania

408
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
because it was all sitting there.

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Including my mother and father, who lived long enough

410
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to see their kid build that building.

411
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.

412
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And he was there, Tito Puente.

413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and they recorded with us.

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.

416
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing

417
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and that's where we recorded the first Grammy.

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.

419
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey

422
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there

423
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
singing excerpts from this album,

424
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the rights to which she donated to our school.

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty

426
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
(Laughter)

428
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,

429
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
right behind Tony Bennett.

430
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I think we're going to be fine.

431
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --

432
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and so I had another cardboard box built

433
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and I walked back out in the streets again.

434
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And that's the building, and that's the model,

435
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse

436
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and in the middle's the medical technology building.

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.

438
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --

439
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
triple that in the middle of the inner city.

440
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And there's the fountain.

441
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
(Laughter)

442
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Every building has a fountain.

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and they took half the building,

445
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and we now train medical technicians through all their system.

446
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And Mellon Bank's a tenant.

447
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I love them because they pay the rent on time.

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
(Laughter)

449
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And as a result of the association,

450
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation

451
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
that bought Dreyfus.

452
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And this is in the process of being built as we speak.

453
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that's going to open in October this year

455
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
because we're going to grow those flowers

456
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
in the middle of the inner city.

457
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And we're going to have high school kids

458
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.

459
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers

460
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,

462
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
who are Hispanic.

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership

464
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And I told my United States senator

466
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that there was a very high probability

467
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that if he could find some funding for this,

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,

469
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to which he readily agreed.

470
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And we got the funding and we open in the fall.

471
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And you ought to come and see it -- it's going to be a hell of a story.

472
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And this is what I want to do when I grow up.

473
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
(Laughter)

474
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at

475
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --

478
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
for four million dollars and I didn't do it.

479
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I built the first building, and guess what happened?

480
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations

481
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and said, "Mr. Strickland,

483
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award

484
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
because you've appreciated our property values

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
beyond our wildest expectations.

486
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Thank you very much for that."

487
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,

488
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
just in case they do come true.

489
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And finally, there's this picture.

490
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This is in a place called San Francisco.

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And the reason this picture's in here is

492
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,

493
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.

494
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He said, "Man, that's a great story.

495
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I want one of those."

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?"

497
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
He says, "I run the city of San Francisco.

498
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
My name's Willie Brown."

499
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise

500
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and put it out of my mind.

501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And that weekend, I was going back home

502
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --

503
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
first time I'd met him.

504
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And he walked in and he says, "What is this?"

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center

506
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
for poor people."

507
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And he said, "As God as my witness,

508
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.

509
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And now I really want to build one."

510
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I said, "Well, where would you build this thing?"

511
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He said, "San Francisco."

512
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?"

513
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
(Laughter)

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,

515
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,

516
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.

517
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And Willie Brown said, "As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,

518
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm going to build this thing

519
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
as a legacy to the poor people of this city."

520
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay

521
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and we got an architect and we got a general contractor

522
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and we got Herbie on the board,

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,

524
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo

525
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and Genentech.

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And along the way, I met this real short guy

527
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
at my slide show in the Silicon Valley.

528
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He came up to me afterwards,

529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I want to help you."

531
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I said, "Well, thank you very much for that.

532
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
What do you do for a living?"

533
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
He said, "Well, I built a company called eBay."

534
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I said, "Well, that's very nice.

535
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk."

536
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,

537
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but I had the presence of mind to go back

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.

539
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I said, "Hey man, what is eBay?"

540
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network."

541
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing

542
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and he left me his card."

543
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So, I called him up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Skoll,

544
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are

545
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
(Laughter)

546
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and I'd like to become your friend."

547
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
(Laughter)

548
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And Jeff and I did become friends,

549
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and he's organized a team of people

550
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and we're going to build this center.

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,

552
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and I said, "The mayor sent me down here to work with you

553
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and I want to build a center with you,

554
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.

555
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And all I've got is a box of slides."

556
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people

557
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken

558
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and it was 100 degrees outside,

559
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and I started showing these pictures.

560
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.

561
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I ran the story and I said, "What do you think?"

562
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,

563
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
"In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.

565
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm going with you, man."

566
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And she turned that audience around on a pin.

567
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,

568
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and we're going to build it all right.

569
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I think we can get in the ground this year

570
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.

571
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way

572
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and I showed him the box of slides.

573
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And Quincy said, "I want to help you, man.

574
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's do one in L.A."

575
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And so he's assembled a group of people.

576
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I've fallen in love with him,

577
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
as I have with Herbie and with his music.

578
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"

579
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I said, "It came from your music, man.

580
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums

581
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
when I was 16 years old in the pottery class,

582
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
when the world was all dark,

583
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and your music got me to the sunlight."

584
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I said, "If I can follow that music,

585
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.

586
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And if that's not true, how did I get here?"

587
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I want you all to know

588
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
that I think the world is a place that's worth living.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I believe in you.

590
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I believe in your hopes and your dreams,

591
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I believe in your intelligence

592
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and I believe in your enthusiasm.

593
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I'm tired of living like this,

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
going into town after town with people standing around on corners

595
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.

596
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.

597
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,

598
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
most of whom look like me.

599
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

600
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.

601
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Do the math -- it will never work.

602
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I am banking on you

603
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard

604
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and very decent people who still believe in something.

605
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.

606
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And I don't think I'm crazy.

607
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think we can get home on this thing

608
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and I think we can build these all over the country

609
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
for less money than we're spending on prisons.

610
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I believe we can turn this whole story around

611
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
to one of celebration and one of hope.

612
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
In my business it's very difficult work.

613
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon --

614
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
never enough money, too much need --

615
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and so there is a tendency

616
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.

617
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:

618
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.

619
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.

620
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And thanks for listening to what I had to say.

621
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:22,000
(Applause)
