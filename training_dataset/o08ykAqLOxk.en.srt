0
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:17,579
Do you think the world is going
to be a better place next year?

1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,823
In the next decade?

2
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,420
Can we end hunger,

3
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,975
achieve gender equality,

4
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,121
halt climate change,

5
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,708
all in the next 15 years?

6
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:35,668
Well, according to the governments
of the world, yes we can.

7
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,961
In the last few days,
the leaders of the world,

8
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,461
meeting at the UN in New York,

9
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:44,240
agreed a new set of Global Goals

10
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:47,064
for the development of the world to 2030.

11
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:48,916
And here they are:

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,172
these goals are the product
of a massive consultation exercise.

13
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:59,085
The Global Goals are who we,
humanity, want to be.

14
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:03,575
Now that's the plan, but can we get there?

15
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:07,620
Can this vision for a better world
really be achieved?

16
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:12,007
Well, I'm here today because
we've run the numbers,

17
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:16,575
and the answer, shockingly,

18
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,043
is that maybe we actually can.

19
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,702
But not with business as usual.

20
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:26,812
Now, the idea that the world
is going to get a better place

21
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,741
may seem a little fanciful.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,575
Watch the news every day and the world
seems to be going backwards, not forwards.

23
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,297
And let's be frank:

24
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:38,575
it's pretty easy to be skeptical
about grand announcements

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,018
coming out of the UN.

26
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:45,162
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.

27
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,853
Because back in 2001,

28
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:52,397
the UN agreed another set of goals,
the Millennium Development Goals.

29
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:57,338
And the flagship target there
was to halve the proportion of people

30
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:00,313
living in poverty by 2015.

31
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:04,889
The target was to take
from a baseline of 1990,

32
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:08,575
when 36 percent of the world's
population lived in poverty,

33
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,792
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.

34
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,575
Did we hit this target?

35
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,050
Well, no, we didn't.

36
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,280
We exceeded it.

37
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:22,860
This year, global poverty
is going to fall to 12 percent.

38
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,575
Now, that's still not good enough,

39
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,218
and the world does still have
plenty of problems.

40
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:34,677
But the pessimists and doomsayers
who say that the world can't get better

41
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,010
are simply wrong.

42
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,575
So how did we achieve this success?

43
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,740
Well, a lot of it was because
of economic growth.

44
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:48,575
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
were in countries such as China and India,

45
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,461
which have seen rapid
economic growth in recent years.

46
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,575
So can we pull off the same trick again?

47
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:59,467
Can economic growth
get us to the Global Goals?

48
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:02,381
Well, to answer that question,

49
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:06,575
we need to benchmark where the world
is today against the Global Goals

50
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,173
and figure out how far we have to travel.

51
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,949
But that ain't easy,

52
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:14,790
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,

53
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,069
they're also pretty complicated.

54
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,743
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets

55
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,452
and literally hundreds of indicators.

56
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:29,048
Also, while some of the goals
are pretty specific --

57
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,495
end hunger --

58
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,415
others are a lot vaguer --

59
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,041
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.

60
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,849
So to help us with this benchmarking,

61
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,619
I'm going to use a tool
called the Social Progress Index.

62
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,120
What this does is measures all the stuff
the Global Goals are trying to achieve,

63
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:50,306
but sums it up into a single number
that we can use as our benchmark

64
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,479
and track progress over time.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,453
The Social Progress Index basically asks
three fundamental questions

66
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:57,738
about a society.

67
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,679
First of all, does everyone have
the basic needs of survival:

68
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,511
food, water, shelter, safety?

69
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,289
Secondly, does everyone have
the building blocks of a better life:

70
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:12,574
education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?

71
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,839
And does everyone have
the opportunity to improve their lives,

72
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:20,863
through rights, freedom of choice,
freedom from discrimination,

73
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,590
and access to the world's
most advanced knowledge?

74
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:28,575
The Social Progress Index sums all this
together using 52 indicators

75
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,531
to create an aggregate score
on a scale of 0 to 100.

76
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:36,599
And what we find is that there's
a wide diversity of performance

77
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:37,784
in the world today.

78
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,718
The highest performing country,
Norway, scores 88.

79
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,668
The lowest performing country,
Central African Republic, scores 31.

80
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,695
And we can add up
all the countries together,

81
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:52,153
weighting for the different
population sizes,

82
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:55,575
and that global score is 61.

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,311
In concrete terms,

84
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:01,093
that means that the average human being
is living on a level of social progress

85
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:04,539
about the same of Cuba
or Kazakhstan today.

86
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,785
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.

87
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,428
What do we have to get to
to achieve the Global Goals?

88
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,742
Now, the Global Goals
are certainly ambitious,

89
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:18,800
but they're not about turning the world
into Norway in just 15 years.

90
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:23,494
So having looked at the numbers,
my estimate is that a score of 75

91
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:27,575
would not only be a giant leap forward
in human well-being,

92
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,721
it would also count as hitting
the Global Goals target.

93
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:34,198
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.

94
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,251
Can we get there?

95
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,259
Well, the Social Progress Index
can help us calculate this,

96
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,949
because as you might have noticed,

97
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,198
there are no economic indicators in there;

98
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:47,699
there's no GDP or economic growth
in the Social Progress Index model.

99
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,575
And what that lets us do
is understand the relationship

100
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,883
between economic growth
and social progress.

101
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:57,369
Let me show you on this chart.

102
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:00,575
So here on the vertical axis,
I've put social progress,

103
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,167
the stuff the Global Goals
are trying to achieve.

104
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,737
Higher is better.

105
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:08,145
And then on the horizontal axis,
is GDP per capita.

106
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,708
Further to the right means richer.

107
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:14,032
And in there, I'm now going to put
all the countries of the world,

108
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,164
each one represented by a dot,

109
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,783
and on top of that I'm going to put
the regression line

110
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,806
that shows the average relationship.

111
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:24,691
And what this tells us
is that as we get richer,

112
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,223
social progress does tend to improve.

113
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:32,663
However, as we get richer,
each extra dollar of GDP

114
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,284
is buying us less and less
social progress.

115
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,848
And now we can use this information
to start building our forecast.

116
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,209
So here is the world in 2015.

117
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:48,116
We have a social progress score of 61

118
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,324
and a GDP per capita of $14,000.

119
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:56,123
And the place we're trying to get to,
remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.

120
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:59,805
So here we are today,
$14,000 per capita GDP.

121
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,655
How rich are we going to be in 2030?

122
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,517
That's what we need to know next.

123
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,792
Well, the best forecast we can find comes
from the US Department of Agriculture,

124
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:13,467
which forecasts 3,1 percent
average global economic growth

125
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,235
over the next 15 years,

126
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,378
which means that in 2030,
if they're right,

127
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:22,428
per capita GDP will be about $23,000.

128
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,834
So now the question is:
if we get that much richer,

129
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,159
how much social progress
are we going to get?

130
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,357
Well, we asked a team
of economists at Deloitte

131
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,150
who checked and crunched the numbers,

132
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:38,126
and they came back and said, well, look:
if the world's average wealth goes

133
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,926
from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,

134
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,238
social progress is going to increase

135
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:48,625
from 61 to 62,4.

136
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,839
(Laughter)

137
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:55,362
Just 62,4. Just a tiny increase.

138
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,862
Now this seems a bit strange.

139
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,098
Economic growth seems
to have really helped

140
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,811
in the fight against poverty,

141
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,035
but it doesn't seem
to be having much impact

142
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,142
on trying to get to the Global Goals.

143
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,761
So what's going on?

144
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,873
Well, I think there are two things.

145
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:13,764
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.

146
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:16,780
We've used up the easy wins
from economic growth,

147
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,152
and now we're moving on
to harder problems.

148
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,038
And also, we know that economic growth
comes with costs as well as benefits.

149
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:28,586
There are costs to the environment, costs
from new health problems like obesity.

150
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,110
So that's the bad news.

151
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:35,441
We're not going to get to the Global Goals
just by getting richer.

152
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,033
So are the pessimists right?

153
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,941
Well, maybe not.

154
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:43,868
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.

155
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,042
Let me take you back
to that regression line.

156
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:50,446
So this is the average relationship
between GDP and social progress,

157
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,356
and this is what our
last forecast was based on.

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,713
But as you saw already,

159
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:59,662
there is actually lots of noise
around this trend line.

160
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,908
What that tells us, quite simply,

161
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:06,035
is that GDP is not destiny.

162
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,067
We have countries that are underperforming

163
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,740
on social progress,
relative to their wealth.

164
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,671
Russia has lots
of natural resource wealth,

165
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,847
but lots of social problems.

166
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,102
China has boomed economically,

167
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,329
but hasn't made much headway
on human rights or environmental issues.

168
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,574
India has a space program
and millions of people without toilets.

169
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:32,561
Now, on the other hand, we have countries
that are overperforming

170
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,575
on social progress relative to their GDP.

171
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:41,633
Costa Rica has prioritized education,
health and environmental sustainability,

172
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:45,578
and as a result, it's achieving
a very high level of social progress,

173
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:48,852
despite only having a rather modest GDP.

174
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:51,575
And Costa Rica's not alone.

175
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:55,575
From poor countries like Rwanda
to richer countries like New Zealand,

176
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,197
we see that it's possible to get
lots of social progress,

177
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,824
even if your GDP is not so great.

178
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,903
And that's really important,
because it tells us two things.

179
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:11,492
First of all, it tells us that we already
in the world have the solutions

180
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:15,344
to many of the problems
that the Global Goals are trying to solve.

181
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,601
It also tells us
that we're not slaves to GDP.

182
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,304
Our choices matter: if we prioritize
the well-being of people,

183
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:28,204
then we can make a lot more progress
than our GDP might expect.

184
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,160
How much? Enough to get us
to the Global Goals?

185
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,795
Well, let's look at some numbers.

186
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,680
What we know already: the world today
is scoring 61 on social progress,

187
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,502
and the place we want to get to is 75.

188
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,746
If we rely on economic growth alone,

189
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,351
we're going to get to 62,4.

190
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,477
So let's assume now that we can get
the countries that are currently

191
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:52,695
underperforming on social progress --
the Russia, China, Indias --

192
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,019
just up to the average.

193
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:56,599
How much social progress does that get us?

194
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,734
Well, that takes us to 65.

195
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:02,203
It's a bit better, but still
quite a long way to go.

196
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,588
So let's get a little bit more
optimistic and say,

197
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:07,402
what if every country
gets a little bit better

198
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,813
at turning its wealth into well-being?

199
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,591
Well then, we get to 67.

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,095
And now let's be even bolder still.

201
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:20,575
What if every country in the world
chose to be like Costa Rica

202
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,969
in prioritizing human well-being,

203
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:25,575
using its wealth for the well-being
of its citizens?

204
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:29,818
Well then, we get to nearly 73,
very close to the Global Goals.

205
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,575
Can we achieve the Global Goals?

206
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,801
Certainly not with business as usual.

207
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,629
Even a flood tide of economic growth
is not going to get us there,

208
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,716
if it just raises the mega-yachts
and the super-wealthy

209
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,534
and leaves the rest behind.

210
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:49,171
If we're going to achieve the Global Goals
we have to do things differently.

211
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:53,404
We have to prioritize social progress,
and really scale solutions

212
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:54,918
around the world.

213
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:58,657
I believe the Global Goals
are a historic opportunity,

214
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:02,276
because the world's leaders
have promised to deliver them.

215
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,074
Let's not dismiss the goals
or slide into pessimism;

216
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,090
let's hold them to that promise.

217
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,159
And we need to hold them to that promise
by holding them accountable,

218
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,474
tracking their progress all the way
through the next 15 years.

219
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,610
And I want to finish by showing you

220
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,399
a way to do that, called
the People's Report Card.

221
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:26,330
The People's Report Card brings together
all this data into a simple framework

222
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:28,894
that we'll all be familiar
with from our school days,

223
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,346
to hold them to account.

224
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,625
It grades our performance
on the Global Goals

225
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,120
on a scale from F to A,

226
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:41,237
where F is humanity at its worst,
and A is humanity at its best.

227
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,461
Our world today is scoring a C-.

228
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,834
The Global Goals are all about
getting to an A,

229
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:54,575
and that's why we're going to be updating
the People's Report Card annually,

230
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,812
for the world and for all
the countries of the world,

231
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,427
so we can hold our leaders to account

232
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:04,593
to achieve this target
and fulfill this promise.

233
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,827
Because getting to the Global Goals will
only happen if we do things differently,

234
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,018
if our leaders do things differently,

235
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,939
and for that to happen,
that needs us to demand it.

236
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,971
So let's reject business as usual.

237
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,913
Let's demand a different path.

238
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:27,183
Let's choose the world that we want.

239
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,309
Thank you.

240
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:34,575
(Applause)

241
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,476
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.

242
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,498
Michael, just one question:
the Millennium Development Goals

243
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,003
established 15 years ago,

244
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:46,104
they were kind of applying
to every country

245
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:49,695
but it turned out to be really
a scorecard for emerging countries.

246
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,171
Now the new Global Goals
are explicitly universal.

247
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:56,347
They ask for every country to show action
and to show progress.

248
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,359
How can I, as a private citizen,
use the report card

249
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:02,217
to create pressure for action?

250
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,116
Michael Green: This is a really important
point; it's a big shift in priorities --

251
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,619
it's no longer about poor
countries and just poverty.

252
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:09,858
It's about every country.

253
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,512
And every country is going to have
challenges in getting to the Global Goals.

254
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:16,846
Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,
Switzerland has got to work to do.

255
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,240
And so that's why we're going to produce
these report cards in 2016

256
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:21,750
for every country in the world.

257
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,853
Then we can really see, how are we doing?

258
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:26,758
And it's not going to be rich countries
scoring straight A's.

259
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,390
And that, then, I think,
is to provide a point of focus

260
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:32,870
for people to start demanding action
and start demanding progress.

261
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:34,342
BG: Thank you very much.

262
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:37,599
(Applause)
