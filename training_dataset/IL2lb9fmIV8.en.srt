0
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,983
I once had this nightmare:

1
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,908
I'm standing in the middle
of a deserted field full of land mines.

2
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:22,036
In real life, I love to hike,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,729
but every time I want to go on a hike,
it makes me nervous.

4
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,851
I have this thought in the back of my mind

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,389
that I might lose a limb.

6
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,101
This underlying fear started 10 years ago,

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,423
after I met Mohammed,
a cluster bomb survivor

8
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:41,383
of the summer 2006
Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.

9
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:45,557
Mohammed, like so many
other survivors all around the world,

10
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:50,568
had to live through the horrifying
repercussions of cluster munitions

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,184
on a daily basis.

12
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:55,761
When the one-month conflict
started in Lebanon,

13
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:59,098
I was still working
at Agence France-Presse in Paris.

14
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:02,439
I remember how I was glued to the screens,

15
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,648
anxiously following the news.

16
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:06,838
I wanted to reassure myself

17
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:09,741
that the falling bombs
missed my parents' home.

18
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:14,311
When I arrived in Beirut
on assignment to cover that war,

19
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,803
I was relieved to be united
with my family,

20
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,950
after they had finally managed
to escape southern Lebanon.

21
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,543
The day the war was over,

22
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,718
I remember seeing this image --

23
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,185
one of blocked roads,

24
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:30,338
of displaced people eagerly rushing
south, back to their homes,

25
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:32,457
regardless of what they would find.

26
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:36,444
An estimated four million
cluster submunitions

27
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:40,104
were spread in Lebanon during
the 34-day conflict.

28
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:46,001
Mohammed lost both legs
during the last week of the conflict.

29
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,877
The fact that he lives a five-minute
drive from my parents' home

30
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,656
made it easier to follow
him through the years.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,660
It was now almost 10 years
since we first met.

32
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,860
I saw the young boy

33
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,764
who had to endure
physical and emotional trauma.

34
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:05,609
I saw the teenager who tried
to offer his friends tattoos,

35
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,186
in return for a set fee of five dollars.

36
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,313
And I know the young, jobless man
who spends hours surfing the Internet

37
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:16,430
trying to meet a girl who might
become his girlfriend.

38
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:20,922
His fate and the effects
of losing his legs

39
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,943
are now his daily reality.

40
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,967
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed

41
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,444
have to deal with so many details
that never occur to us.

42
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:30,993
Who would have imagined

43
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,752
that so many daily tasks we do
or take for granted,

44
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:38,029
such as going to the beach or even
picking up something from the floor,

45
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:41,077
would become sources
of stress and anxiety?

46
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:44,197
Well, that's what eventually
became of Mohammed,

47
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,963
due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.

48
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:52,135
Ten years ago, I had no clue
what a cluster bomb was,

49
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,447
nor its horrifying implications.

50
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,272
I learned that this indiscriminate
weapon was used

51
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,811
in so many parts of the world

52
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:01,107
and continues to kill on a regular basis,

53
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:04,170
without distinguishing
between a military target

54
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,366
or a child.

55
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,982
I naively asked myself,

56
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:11,385
"But seriously, who made those weapons?

57
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,200
And what for?"

58
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,155
Let me explain to you
what a cluster bomb is.

59
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,353
It's a large canister
filled with bomblets.

60
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,040
When it's dropped from the air,

61
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:25,164
it opens up in midair to release
hundreds of bomblets.

62
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,750
They scatter around wide areas

63
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,927
and on impact,

64
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,634
many fail to explode.

65
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,569
Those unexploded ones end up
just like landmines --

66
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:35,826
sitting on the ground,

67
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,821
waiting for their next target.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,014
If someone steps on them by accident

69
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,196
or picks them up,

70
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,678
they can explode.

71
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:47,166
These weapons are extremely unpredictable,

72
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,219
which makes the threat even bigger.

73
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:52,342
One day, a farmer can work
his land without a problem.

74
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:56,321
The next day, he can make fire
and burn some branches,

75
00:03:56,345 --> 00:04:00,135
and the submunitions close by
could be set off because of the heat.

76
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,311
The problem is children mistake
those bomblets for toys,

77
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,686
because they can look like
bouncy balls or soda cans.

78
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:10,809
Being a documentary photographer,

79
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,972
I decided to go back to Lebanon
a few months after the conflict ended

80
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:16,969
to meet cluster bomb survivors.

81
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,144
And I met a few --

82
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,741
Hussein and Rasha,

83
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:21,766
who both lost a leg to submunitions.

84
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,359
Their stories are similar to so many
other kids' stories across the world

85
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:29,432
and are a testimony
to the horrifying implications

86
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:32,286
of the continuous use of such weapons.

87
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,917
That's when I met Mohammed,
in January 2007.

88
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,707
He was 11 years old,

89
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:42,245
and I met him exactly four months
after his accident.

90
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:43,928
When I first saw him,

91
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,071
he was going through painful physiotherapy

92
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,071
to recover from his fresh wounds.

93
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,819
Still in shock at such a young age,

94
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,337
Mohammed was struggling
to get used to his new body.

95
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,960
He would even wake up sometimes
at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.

96
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:03,876
What drew me closer to his story
was my instant realization

97
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,466
of the difficulties Mohammed
was likely to face in the future --

98
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:11,322
that what he has been suffering
while adjusting to his injury

99
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,016
at the age of 11,

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,656
would increase manyfold.

101
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,361
Even before his disability,

102
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,602
Mohammed's life wasn't easy.

103
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:22,906
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp
for Palestinian refugees,

104
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,079
and this is where he still lives.

105
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:28,825
Lebanon holds some 400,000
Palestinian refugees,

106
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:31,147
and they suffer from discriminatory laws.

107
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:34,235
They're not allowed to work
in the public sector

108
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,242
or practice certain professions

109
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,254
and are denied the right to own property.

110
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,533
This is one of the reasons

111
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,300
why Mohammed doesn't really
regret dropping out of school

112
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:44,996
right after his injury.

113
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:48,936
He said, "What's the point
of a university degree

114
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,123
when I can't find a job to start with?"

115
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:57,260
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle
of impact on communities,

116
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,969
and not only the lives of their victims.

117
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,808
Many who get injured by this weapon
drop out of school,

118
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:06,269
can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,

119
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:09,490
therefore losing the ability
to provide for their families.

120
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:13,214
This is not to mention
the continuous physical pain

121
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,343
and the experience of feeling isolated.

122
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:20,600
These weapons affect
the poorest of the poor.

123
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,503
The high medical cost
is a burden to the families.

124
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,931
They end up relying
on humanitarian agencies,

125
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:29,484
which is insufficient and unsustainable,

126
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:33,150
especially when injuries require
lifelong support to the injured.

127
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,542
Ten years after Mohammed's injury,

128
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:39,285
he is still unable to afford
proper prosthetic legs.

129
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,661
He's very cautious with his steps,

130
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,703
as a couple of falls over the years

131
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,147
brought him embarrassment
among his friends.

132
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,297
He joked that since he doesn't have legs,

133
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,977
some days he tries to walk on his hands.

134
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:56,412
One of the worst yet invisible
impacts of the weapon

135
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:58,988
is the psychological scars it leaves.

136
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:01,664
In one of Mohammed's
early medical reports,

137
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,731
he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.

138
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:09,987
He suffered from anxiety,
poor appetite, sleep disturbance

139
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:12,422
and showed signs of anger.

140
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:17,811
The reality is Mohammed never received
proper help to fully recover.

141
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,487
His current obsession
is to leave Lebanon at any cost --

142
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,376
even if it meant embarking
on a hazardous journey

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,979
along with refugees drifting towards
Europe today through the Mediterranean.

144
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,295
Knowing how risky such a journey would be,

145
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,439
he said, "If I were to die on the way,

146
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:37,723
it doesn't matter."

147
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:40,863
To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.

148
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,302
Cluster bombs are a world problem,

149
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:49,987
as this munition keeps destroying
and hurting whole communities

150
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,714
for generations to come.

151
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:56,132
In an online interview with the director
of the Mines Advisory Group,

152
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,307
Jamie Franklin,

153
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:58,487
he said,

154
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:03,063
"The US forces dropped over two million
tons of munitions over Laos.

155
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,255
If they couldn't find
their targets in Vietnam,

156
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,576
there were free-drop areas in Laos
where planes would drop their loads

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,595
before going back to base,

158
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:15,656
because it's dangerous to land
with loaded planes."

159
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,415
According to the International
Committee of the Red Cross,

160
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,795
in Laos alone -- one of the poorest
countries in the world --

161
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,632
nine to 27 million unexploded
submunitions remain.

162
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:33,171
Some 11,000 people have been killed
or injured since 1973.

163
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:39,579
This lethal weapon has been used
by over 20 states during armed conflicts

164
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,761
in over 35 countries,

165
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:45,213
such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.

166
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:50,689
So far, 119 states have joined
an international treaty

167
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,424
banning cluster bombs,

168
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,487
which is officially called
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

169
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,867
But some of the biggest producers
of cluster munitions --

170
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:03,230
namely, the United States,
Russia and China --

171
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:05,724
remain outside of this lifesaving treaty

172
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,685
and continue to produce them,

173
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,528
reserve the right to produce
them in the future,

174
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,278
keep those harmful weapons
in their stockpiles

175
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,490
and even possibly use them in the future.

176
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,712
Cluster bombs have reportedly
been used most recently

177
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:25,123
in the ongoing conflicts
in Yemen and Syria.

178
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,885
According to research
on the worldwide investments

179
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,535
in cluster munitions producers

180
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,642
by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,

181
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,256
financial institutions invested
billions of US dollars

182
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,063
into companies that make
cluster munitions.

183
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,508
The majority of these institutions
are based in countries

184
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:48,053
that have not yet signed
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

185
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:51,141
Getting back to Mohammed,

186
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:54,815
one of the few jobs he was able
to find was picking lemons.

187
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:59,067
When I ask him if it's safe
to work in the field he said,

188
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,300
"I'm not sure."

189
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:05,691
Research shows that cluster munitions
often contaminate areas

190
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,957
where agriculture is the main
source of income.

191
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:12,890
According to Handicap
International's research,

192
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:18,892
98 percent of those killed or injured
by cluster munitions are civilians.

193
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,689
Eighty-four percent
of casualties are males.

194
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:25,807
In countries where
these people have no choice

195
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:27,887
but to work in those fields,

196
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,567
they simply do it

197
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:30,823
and risk it.

198
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,982
Mohammed is the only male
to three sisters.

199
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:38,332
Culturally, he's expected
to provide for his family,

200
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,765
but he simply can't.

201
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,201
He tried to have so many different jobs,

202
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,791
but he couldn't keep any
due to his physical disability

203
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:49,280
and the less-than-friendly environment
to people with disabilities,

204
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:50,525
to say the least.

205
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,911
It hurts him a lot when he goes
out looking for a job,

206
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,128
and he's turned away

207
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:58,817
with a small amount of money
paid to him out of pity.

208
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,381
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money,

209
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,113
I just want to earn it."

210
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:08,182
Mohammed today is 21 years old.

211
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,404
He's illiterate,

212
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,497
and he communicates with voice messages.

213
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,274
Here is one of his messages.

214
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:20,209
(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)

215
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,900
Laura Boushnak:
He said, "My dream is to run,

216
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:28,101
and I'm pretty sure once I start running,

217
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,635
I would never stop."

218
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,842
Thank you.

219
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:35,690
(Applause)
