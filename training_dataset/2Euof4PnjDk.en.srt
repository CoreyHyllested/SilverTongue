00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,640
Interpreter: Piano, "p,"
is my favorite musical symbol.

1
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,170
It means to play softly.

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,349
If you're playing a musical instrument
and you notice a "p" in the score,

3
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:28,279
you need to play softer.

4
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,080
Two p's -- even softer.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,570
Four p's -- extremely soft.

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,910
This is my drawing of a p-tree,

7
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,149
which demonstrates

8
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,460
no matter how many thousands
upon thousands of p's there may be,

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,739
you'll never reach complete silence.

10
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,100
That's my current definition of silence:

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,129
a very obscure sound.

12
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,030
I'd like to share a little bit

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,809
about the history
of American Sign Language, ASL,

14
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,970
plus a bit of my own background.

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,260
French sign language was brought
to America during the early 1800s,

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,330
and as time went by,
mixed with local signs,

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,290
it evolved into the language
we know today as ASL.

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,890
So it has a history of about 200 years.

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,460
I was born deaf,

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,930
and I was taught to believe
that sound wasn't a part of my life.

21
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,030
And I believed it to be true.

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,780
Yet, I realize now
that that wasn't the case at all.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,470
Sound was very much a part of my life,

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,720
really, on my mind every day.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,910
As a Deaf person living
in a world of sound,

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,560
it's as if I was living
in a foreign country,

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,750
blindly following its rules,
customs, behaviors and norms

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:13,590
without ever questioning them.

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,700
So how is it that I understand sound?

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,840
Well, I watch how people
behave and respond to sound.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,380
You people are like my loudspeakers,
and amplify sound.

32
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,500
I learn and mirror that behavior.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,900
At the same time,
I've learned that I create sound,

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,240
and I've seen how people respond to me.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,090
Thus I've learned, for example ...

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,320
"Don't slam the door!"

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,820
"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

38
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,650
(Laughter)

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,320
"Don't burp,

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,040
and when you're eating,

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,230
make sure you don't scrape
your utensils on the plate."

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,380
All of these things
I term "sound etiquette."

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,440
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,040
more than the average hearing person does.

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,400
And I'm always waiting
in eager nervous anticipation

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,450
around sound, about what's to come next.

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,300
Hence, this drawing.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,760
TBD, to be decided.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,660
TBC, to be continued.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,240
TBA, to be announced.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,700
And you notice the staff --

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,150
there are no notes contained in the lines.

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,480
That's because the lines
already contain sound

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,610
through the subtle smudges and smears.

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:49,850
In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.

57
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,080
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,970
A typical staff contains five lines.

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,550
Yet for me, signing it
with my thumb sticking up like that

60
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,200
doesn't feel natural.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,690
That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
I stick to four lines on paper.

62
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,310
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
to travel to Berlin, Germany,

63
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,140
for an artist residency there.

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,320
Prior to this time,
I had been working as a painter.

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,370
During this summer, I visited
different museums and gallery spaces,

66
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,220
and as I went from one place to the next,

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,820
I noticed there was no visual art there.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,940
At that time, sound was trending,
and this struck me ...

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,160
there was no visual art,

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
everything was auditory.

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,350
Now sound has come into my art territory.

72
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,669
Is it going to further
distance me from art?

73
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,470
I realized that doesn't
have to be the case at all.

74
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,790
I actually know sound.

75
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,530
I know it so well

76
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,910
that it doesn't have to be something
just experienced through the ears.

77
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,800
It could be felt tactually,

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,350
or experienced as a visual,

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,180
or even as an idea.

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,370
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

81
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,210
and to put it into my art practice.

82
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,669
And everything that I had been
taught regarding sound,

83
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,180
I decided to do away with and unlearn.

84
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,970
I started creating a new body of work.

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,560
And when I presented this
to the art community,

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,590
I was blown away with the amount
of support and attention I received.

87
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,490
I realized:

88
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,460
sound is like money,

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,639
power, control --

90
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,440
social currency.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,510
In the back of my mind, I've always felt
that sound was your thing,

92
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,220
a hearing person's thing.

93
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,570
And sound is so powerful

94
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,360
that it could either
disempower me and my artwork,

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,229
or it could empower me.

96
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,550
I chose to be empowered.

97
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,470
There's a massive culture
around spoken language.

98
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,100
And just because I don't use
my literal voice to communicate,

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:25,050
in society's eyes
it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

100
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,919
So I need to work with individuals
who can support me as an equal

101
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,760
and become my voice.

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,880
And that way, I'm able to maintain
relevancy in society today.

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,160
So at school, at work and institutions,

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,500
I work with many
different ASL interpreters.

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,500
And their voice becomes
my voice and identity.

106
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,720
They help me to be heard.

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,350
And their voices hold value and currency.

108
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,509
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,

109
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,620
I'm able to maintain
a temporary form of currency,

110
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,240
kind of like taking out a loan
with a very high interest rate.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,130
If I didn't continue this practice,

112
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,080
I feel that I could just
fade off into oblivion

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,660
and not maintain
any form of social currency.

114
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,220
So with sound as my new art medium,

115
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,440
I delved into the world of music.

116
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,330
And I was surprised to see
the similarities between music and ASL.

117
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,770
For example,

118
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,290
a musical note

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,960
cannot be fully captured
and expressed on paper.

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,770
And the same holds true
for a concept in ASL.

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,320
They're both highly spatial
and highly inflected --

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,419
meaning that subtle changes

123
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,360
can affect the entire meaning

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,080
of both signs and sounds.

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,270
I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,

126
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,070
to have you have a better
understanding of how ASL works.

127
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,979
So, envision a piano.

128
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,900
ASL is broken down into
many different grammatical parameters.

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,880
If you assign a different parameter
to each finger as you play the piano --

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,009
such as facial expression, body movement,

131
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,860
speed, hand shape and so on,

132
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,939
as you play the piano --

133
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,939
English is a linear language,

134
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,860
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

135
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,309
However, ASL is more like a chord --

136
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,730
all 10 fingers need
to come down simultaneously

137
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,740
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

138
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,079
If just one of those keys
were to change the chord,

139
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,269
it would create a completely
different meaning.

140
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:12,679
The same applies to music
in regards to pitch, tone and volume.

141
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,269
In ASL, by playing around with these
different grammatical parameters,

142
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,929
you can express different ideas.

143
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:20,420
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

144
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,550
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

145
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:28,259
I'm looking at you.

146
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,889
Staring at you.

147
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,759
(Laughter)

148
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,619
(Laughter)

149
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:38,350
Oh -- busted.

150
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,220
(Laughter)

151
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,079
Uh-oh.

152
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,490
What are you looking at?

153
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,170
Aw, stop.

154
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,509
(Laughter)

155
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,730
I then started thinking,

156
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,709
"What if I was to look at ASL
through a musical lens?"

157
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,369
If I was to create a sign
and repeat it over and over,

158
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:04,110
it could become
like a piece of visual music.

159
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,850
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

160
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,100
as the sun rises and sets.

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,569
This is "all day."

162
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:20,100
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,

163
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,369
visually it looks like a piece of music.

164
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:27,249
All ... day.

165
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:32,730
I feel the same holds true
for "all night."

166
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,079
"All night."

167
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,759
This is ALL-NIGHT,
represented in this drawing.

168
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,470
And this led me to thinking
about three different kinds of nights:

169
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,809
"last night,"

170
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:50,980
"overnight,"

171
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:00,649
(Sings) "all night long."

172
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:07,970
(Laughter)

173
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,129
I feel like the third one has
a lot more musicality than the other two.

174
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,639
(Laughter)

175
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,670
This represents how time
is expressed in ASL

176
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,059
and how the distance from your body
can express the changes in time.

177
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,119
For example,

178
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,959
1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,

179
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,069
present tense happens closest
and in front of the body,

180
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:34,179
future is in front of the body
and the past is to your back.

181
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,439
So, the first example
is "a long time ago."

182
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,989
Then "past,"

183
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,949
"used to"

184
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:48,489
and the last one, which is my favorite,

185
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,139
with the very romantic
and dramatic notion to it,

186
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,379
"once upon a time."

187
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,230
(Laughter)

188
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,939
"Common time"

189
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,549
is a musical term

190
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,709
with a specific time signature
of four beats per measure.

191
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,509
Yet when I see the word "common time,"

192
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,739
what automatically comes to mind for me
is "at the same time."

193
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:17,709
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

194
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,999
We have the staff
across the head and the chest.

195
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,319
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

196
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,470
[Common time]

197
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,790
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

198
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm now going to demonstrate
a hand shape called the "flash claw."

199
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,679
Can you please follow along with me?

200
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,929
Everybody, hands up.

201
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,739
Now we're going to do it
in both the head and the chest,

202
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:44,730
kind of like "common time"
or at the same time.

203
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,529
Yes, got it.

204
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,819
That means "to fall in love"
in International [Sign].

205
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,259
(Laughter)

206
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,160
International [Sign], as a note,

207
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,679
is a visual tool to help communicate

208
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,160
across cultures and sign languages
around the world.

209
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,129
The second one I'd like
to demonstrate is this --

210
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,309
please follow along with me again.

211
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:17,579
And now this.

212
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:22,179
This is "colonization" in ASL.

213
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,549
(Laughter)

214
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,819
Now the third --

215
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:25,470
please follow along again.

216
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:37,170
And again.

217
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,639
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.

218
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,179
So let's do all three together.

219
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,129
"Fall in love,"

220
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,199
"colonization"

221
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:49,339
and "enlightenment."

222
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,529
Good job, everyone.

223
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,600
(Laughter)

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,410
Notice how all three signs
are very similar,

225
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,629
they all happen at the head and the chest,

226
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,399
but they convey quite different meanings.

227
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,179
So it's amazing to see
how ASL is alive and thriving,

228
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,470
just like music is.

229
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,189
However, in this day and age,

230
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,829
we live in a very audio-centric world.

231
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:14,279
And just because ASL has no sound to it,

232
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,449
it automatically holds no social currency.

233
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:23,989
We need to start thinking harder
about what defines social currency

234
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,959
and allow ASL to develop
its own form of currency --

235
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,449
without sound.

236
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:38,639
And this could possibly be a step
to lead to a more inclusive society.

237
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,489
And maybe people will understand

238
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:44,279
that you don't need
to be deaf to learn ASL,

239
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,869
nor do you have to be hearing
to learn music.

240
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:51,639
ASL is such a rich treasure

241
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,589
that I'd like you
to have the same experience.

242
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,350
And I'd like to invite you
to open your ears,

243
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,350
to open your eyes,

244
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,819
take part in our culture

245
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:03,629
and experience our visual language.

246
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:04,999
And you never know,

247
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:08,189
you might just fall in love with us.

248
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,790
(Applause)

249
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,499
Thank you.

250
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,489
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

251
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:11,889
(Applause)
