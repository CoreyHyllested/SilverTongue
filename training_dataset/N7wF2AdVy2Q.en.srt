0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,376
Late in January 1975,

1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,816
a 17-year-old German girl
called Vera Brandes

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,480
walked out onto the stage
of the Cologne Opera House.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,320
The auditorium was empty.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,640
It was lit only by the dim, green glow
of the emergency exit sign.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,136
This was the most
exciting day of Vera's life.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,176
She was the youngest
concert promoter in Germany,

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,616
and she had persuaded
the Cologne Opera House

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,976
to host a late-night concert of jazz

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,816
1,400 people were coming.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,416
And in just a few hours,

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,856
Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,216
he'd sit down at the piano

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,056
and without rehearsal or sheet music,

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
he would begin to play.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,536
But right now,

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,136
Vera was introducing Keith
to the piano in question,

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,400
and it wasn't going well.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,776
Jarrett looked to the instrument
a little warily,

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,336
played a few notes,

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,575
walked around it,

22
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,056
played a few more notes,

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,776
muttered something to his producer.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,120
Then the producer
came over to Vera and said ...

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,840
"If you don't get a new piano,
Keith can't play."

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,456
There'd been a mistake.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,856
The opera house had provided
the wrong instrument.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,536
This one had this harsh,
tinny upper register,

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,840
because all the felt had worn away.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,776
The black notes were sticking,

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,696
the white notes were out of tune,

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,376
the pedals didn't work

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,576
and the piano itself was just too small.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,016
It wouldn't create the volume

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,960
that would fill a large space
such as the Cologne Opera House.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,560
So Keith Jarrett left.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,240
He went and sat outside in his car,

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,976
leaving Vera Brandes

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,640
to get on the phone
to try to find a replacement piano.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,296
Now she got a piano tuner,

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,920
but she couldn't get a new piano.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,856
And so she went outside

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,480
and she stood there in the rain,

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
talking to Keith Jarrett,

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,080
begging him not to cancel the concert.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,576
And he looked out of his car

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,280
at this bedraggled,
rain-drenched German teenager,

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,056
took pity on her,

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
and said,

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,160
"Never forget ... only for you."

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,896
And so a few hours later,

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Jarrett did indeed step out
onto the stage of the opera house,

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,560
he sat down at the unplayable piano

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
and began.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,640
(Music)

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,056
Within moments it became clear
that something magical was happening.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,656
Jarrett was avoiding
those upper registers,

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,296
he was sticking to the middle
tones of the keyboard,

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,936
which gave the piece
a soothing, ambient quality.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,496
But also, because the piano was so quiet,

61
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,936
he had to set up these rumbling,
repetitive riffs in the bass.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,216
And he stood up twisting,
pounding down on the keys,

63
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,856
desperately trying to create enough volume
to reach the people in the back row.

64
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,896
It's an electrifying performance.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,856
It somehow has this peaceful quality,

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,936
and at the same time it's full of energy,

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,160
it's dynamic.

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,439
And the audience loved it.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,216
Audiences continue to love it

70
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,336
because the recording of the KÃ¶ln Concert

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,856
is the best-selling piano album in history

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,480
and the best-selling
solo jazz album in history.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,320
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,120
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,336
But let's think for a moment
about Jarrett's initial instinct.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,936
He didn't want to play.

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,176
Of course,

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,136
I think any of us,
in any remotely similar situation,

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,736
would feel the same way,
we'd have the same instinct.

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,055
We don't want to be asked
to do good work with bad tools.

81
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,720
We don't want to have to overcome
unnecessary hurdles.

82
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,920
But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,160
and thank goodness he changed his mind.

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,640
And I think our instinct is also wrong.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,216
I think we need to gain
a bit more appreciation

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
for the unexpected advantages
of having to cope with a little mess.

87
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,696
So let me give you some examples

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,176
from cognitive psychology,

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,616
from complexity science,

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,096
from social psychology,

91
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
and of course, rock 'n' roll.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,736
So cognitive psychology first.

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,576
We've actually known for a while

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,936
that certain kinds of difficulty,

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,536
certain kinds of obstacle,

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,322
can actually improve our performance.

97
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:17,056
For example,

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,816
the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,

99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,056
a few years ago,

100
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,136
teamed up with high school teachers.

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,896
And he asked them to reformat the handouts

102
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
that they were giving
to some of their classes.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,534
So the regular handout would be formatted
in something straightforward,

104
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:33,998
such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,856
But half these classes were getting
handouts that were formatted

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,576
in something sort of intense,
like Haettenschweiler,

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,616
or something with a zesty bounce,
like Comic Sans italicized.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,456
Now, these are really ugly fonts,

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,656
and they're difficult fonts to read.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,776
But at the end of the semester,

111
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,416
students were given exams,

112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,096
and the students who'd been asked
to read the more difficult fonts,

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,176
had actually done better on their exams,

114
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,736
in a variety of subjects.

115
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,776
And the reason is,

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,336
the difficult font had slowed them down,

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,416
forced them to work a bit harder,

118
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,016
to think a bit more
about what they were reading,

119
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,280
to interpret it ...

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
and so they learned more.

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
Another example.

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,856
The psychologist Shelley Carson
has been testing Harvard undergraduates

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,856
for the quality
of their attentional filters.

124
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,256
What do I mean by that?

125
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,496
What I mean is,
imagine you're in a restaurant,

126
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,256
you're having a conversation,

127
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,416
there are all kinds of other conversations
going on in the restaurant,

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,776
you want to filter them out,

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,936
you want to focus
on what's important to you.

130
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,176
Can you do that?

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,176
If you can, you have
good, strong attentional filters.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,256
But some people really struggle with that.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,016
Some of Carson's undergraduate
subjects struggled with that.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,976
They had weak filters,
they had porous filters --

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,376
let a lot of external information in.

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,536
And so what that meant is they were
constantly being interrupted

137
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,136
by the sights and the sounds
of the world around them.

138
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,216
If there was a television on
while they were doing their essays,

139
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,656
they couldn't screen it out.

140
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,109
Now, you would think
that that was a disadvantage ...

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,696
but no.

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,696
When Carson looked at what
these students had achieved,

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,496
the ones with the weak filters

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,936
were vastly more likely

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,736
to have some real
creative milestone in their lives,

146
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,096
to have published their first novel,

147
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
to have released their first album.

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,896
These distractions were actually
grists to their creative mill.

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,760
They were able to think outside the box
because their box was full of holes.

150
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,936
Let's talk about complexity science.

151
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,818
So how do you solve a really complex --

152
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,856
the world's full
of complicated problems --

153
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,056
how do you solve
a really complicated problem?

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,216
For example, you try to make a jet engine.

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,456
There are lots and lots
of different variables,

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,433
the operating temperature, the materials,

157
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:52,896
all the different dimensions, the shape.

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,456
You can't solve that kind
of problem all in one go,

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,696
it's too hard.

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,936
So what do you do?

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,896
Well, one thing you can do
is try to solve it step-by-step.

162
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,616
So you have some kind of prototype

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,056
and you tweak it,
you test it, you improve it.

164
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,880
You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.

165
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,536
Now, this idea of marginal gains
will eventually get you a good jet engine.

166
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,856
And it's been quite widely
implemented in the world.

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,376
So you'll hear about it, for example,
in high performance cycling,

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,696
web designers will talk about trying
to optimize their web pages,

169
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,016
they're looking
for these step-by-step gains.

170
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
That's a good way
to solve a complicated problem.

171
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,880
But you know what would
make it a better way?

172
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
A dash of mess.

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,336
You add randomness,

174
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,736
early on in the process,

175
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,256
you make crazy moves,

176
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,655
you try stupid things that shouldn't work,

177
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,696
and that will tend to make
the problem-solving work better.

178
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,256
And the reason for that is

179
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,336
the trouble with the step-by-step process,

180
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,576
the marginal gains,

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,136
is they can walk you
gradually down a dead end.

182
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,376
And if you start with the randomness,
that becomes less likely,

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,800
and your problem-solving
becomes more robust.

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
Let's talk about social psychology.

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,816
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,
with some colleagues,

186
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,896
recently gave murder mystery
problems to some students,

187
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,776
and these students
were collected in groups of four

188
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,136
and they were given dossiers
with information about a crime --

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,040
alibis and evidence,
witness statements and three suspects.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,176
And the groups of four students
were asked to figure out who did it,

191
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
who committed the crime.

192
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,680
And there were two treatments
in this experiment.

193
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,976
In some cases these were four friends,

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
they all knew each other well.

195
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,936
In other cases,

196
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,880
three friends and a stranger.

197
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,096
And you can see where I'm going with this.

198
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,376
Obviously I'm going to say

199
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,816
that the groups with the stranger
solved the problem more effectively,

200
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
which is true, they did.

201
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,296
Actually, they solved the problem
quite a lot more effectively.

202
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,200
So the groups of four friends,

203
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,096
they only had a 50-50 chance
of getting the answer right.

204
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,816
Which is actually not that great --

205
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,776
in multiple choice, for three answers?
50-50's not good.

206
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,976
(Laughter)

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,696
The three friends and the stranger,

208
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,536
even though the stranger
didn't have any extra information,

209
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,096
even though it was just a case

210
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,416
of how that changed the conversation
to accommodate that awkwardness,

211
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,136
the three friends and the stranger,

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,826
they had a 75 percent chance
of finding the right answer.

213
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,576
That's quite a big leap in performance.

214
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,936
But I think what's really interesting

215
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,199
is not just that the three friends
and the stranger did a better job,

216
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,663
but how they felt about it.

217
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,336
So when Katherine Phillips
interviewed the groups of four friends,

218
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,216
they had a nice time,

219
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,200
they also thought they'd done a good job.

220
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
They were complacent.

221
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,296
When she spoke to the three
friends and the stranger,

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,816
they had not had a nice time --

223
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,440
it's actually rather difficult,
it's rather awkward ...

224
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
and they were full of doubt.

225
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,120
They didn't think they'd done a good job
even though they had.

226
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,816
And I think that really exemplifies

227
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,080
the challenge that we're
dealing with here.

228
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,496
Because, yeah --

229
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,376
the ugly font,

230
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,176
the awkward stranger,

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,520
the random move ...

232
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,656
these disruptions help us solve problems,

233
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,016
they help us become more creative.

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,096
But we don't feel that they're helping us.

235
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
We feel that they're
getting in the way ...

236
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,240
and so we resist.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,440
And that's why the last example
is really important.

238
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,576
So I want to talk about somebody

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,536
from the background
of the world of rock 'n' roll.

240
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,456
And you may know him,
he's actually a TED-ster.

241
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,856
His name is Brian Eno.

242
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,696
He is an ambient composer --
rather brilliant.

243
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,400
He's also a kind of catalyst

244
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,176
behind some of the great
rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,816
He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"

246
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,976
he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby"
and "The Joshua Tree,"

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,536
he's worked with DEVO,

248
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,136
he's worked with Coldplay,
he's worked with everybody.

249
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,080
And what does he do to make
these great rock bands better?

250
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Well, he makes a mess.

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,656
He disrupts their creative processes.

252
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,776
It's his role to be the awkward stranger.

253
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,216
It's his role to tell them

254
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,416
that they have to play
the unplayable piano.

255
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,096
And one of the ways
in which he creates this disruption

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,080
is through this remarkable
deck of cards --

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,240
I have my signed copy here --
thank you, Brian.

258
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,416
They're called The Oblique Strategies,

259
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,298
he developed them with a friend of his.

260
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
And when they're stuck in the studio,

261
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,176
Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.

262
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,656
He'll draw one at random,

263
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,936
and he'll make the band
follow the instructions on the card.

264
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
So this one ...

265
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,336
"Change instrument roles."

266
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,075
Yeah, everyone swap instruments --
Drummer on the piano --

267
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,096
Brilliant, brilliant idea.

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
"Look closely at the most
embarrassing details. Amplify them."

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,080
"Make a sudden, destructive,
unpredictable action. Incorporate."

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,320
These cards are disruptive.

271
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Now, they've proved their worth
in album after album.

272
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,176
The musicians hate them.

273
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,696
(Laughter)

274
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,136
So Phil Collins was playing drums
on an early Brian Eno album.

275
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,160
He got so frustrated he started
throwing beer cans across the studio.

276
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,776
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,

277
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,576
working with Eno
on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,

278
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,176
and at one point
he turns to Brian and says,

279
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
"Brian, this experiment is stupid."

280
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,120
But the thing is
it was a pretty good album,

281
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
but also,

282
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,856
Carlos Alomar, 35 years later,
now uses The Oblique Strategies.

283
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,616
And he tells his students
to use The Oblique Strategies

284
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
because he's realized something.

285
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,880
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean it isn't helping you.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,762
The strategies actually
weren't a deck of cards originally,

287
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:15,976
they were just a list --

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,816
list on the recording studio wall.

289
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,640
A checklist of things
you might try if you got stuck.

290
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,480
The list didn't work.

291
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
Know why?

292
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
Not messy enough.

293
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,696
Your eye would go down the list

294
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,776
and it would settle on whatever
was the least disruptive,

295
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
the least troublesome,

296
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,360
which of course misses the point entirely.

297
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,536
And what Brian Eno came to realize was,

298
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,056
yes, we need to run
the stupid experiments,

299
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,136
we need to deal
with the awkward strangers,

300
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,296
we need to try to read the ugly fonts.

301
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,576
These things help us.

302
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,976
They help us solve problems,

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,896
they help us be more creative.

304
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
But also ...

305
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,520
we really need some persuasion
if we're going to accept this.

306
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,440
So however we do it ...

307
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,456
whether it's sheer willpower,

308
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
whether it's the flip of a card

309
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,760
or whether it's a guilt trip
from a German teenager,

310
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,816
all of us, from time to time,

311
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,280
need to sit down and try and play
the unplayable piano.

312
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,856
Thank you.

313
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,760
(Applause)
