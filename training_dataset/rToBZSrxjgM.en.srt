0
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:18,846
I have spent the past 38 years
trying to be invisible.

1
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,259
I'm a copy editor.

2
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,507
I work at The New Yorker,

3
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:27,705
and copyediting for The New Yorker
is like playing shortstop

4
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,943
for a Major League Baseball team:

5
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:33,380
every little movement
gets picked over by the critics --

6
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:36,006
God forbid you should commit an error.

7
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:41,023
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose
what goes into the magazine.

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,908
We work at the level of the sentence,

9
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:45,620
maybe the paragraph,

10
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,722
the words, the punctuation.

11
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,880
Our business is in the details.

12
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:56,038
We put the diaeresis, the double dot,
over the "i" in "naïve."

13
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,518
We impose house style.

14
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,228
Every publication has a house style.

15
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:03,775
The New Yorker's
is particularly distinctive.

16
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:07,283
We sometimes get teased for our style.

17
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:11,647
Imagine -- we still spell
"teen-ager" with a hyphen,

18
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,947
as if that word had just been coined.

19
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,519
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age"

20
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,135
and that diaeresis over "coöperate,"

21
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,161
and you know you're reading
The New Yorker.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,348
Copyediting at The New Yorker
is a mechanical process.

23
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:30,571
There is a related role called
query proofreading,

24
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,451
or page-OK'ing.

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,729
Whereas copyediting is mechanical,

26
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:38,228
query proofreading is interpretive.

27
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:42,068
We make suggestions to the author
through the editor

28
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,713
to improve the emphasis of a sentence

29
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,371
or point out unintentional repetitions

30
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:51,391
and supply compelling alternatives.

31
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,480
Our purpose is to make
the author look good.

32
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:58,833
Note that we give our proofs
not directly to the author,

33
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,376
but to the editor.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,517
This often creates
a good cop/bad cop dynamic

35
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,065
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that
as an umbrella term --

36
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:11,096
is invariably the bad cop.

37
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,445
If we do our job well, we're invisible,

38
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,541
but as soon as we make a mistake,

39
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,381
we copy editors become glaringly visible.

40
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:24,957
Here is the most recent mistake
that was laid at my door.

41
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,455
[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,
the pre-Trump embodiment

42
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,625
of populist no-nothingism
in the Republican Party,

43
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,096
endorsed Trump.]

44
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:39,143
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled
copy editors?" a reader wrote.

45
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:42,333
"Didn't the writer mean
'know-nothingism'?"

46
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,066
Ouch.

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,762
There's no excuse for this mistake.

48
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:49,875
But I like it: "no-nothingism."

49
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,857
It might be American
vernacular for "nihilism."

50
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,088
(Laughter)

51
00:02:57,112 --> 00:03:00,136
Here, another reader quotes
a passage from the magazine:

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,197
[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained
her authoritative bearing;

53
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:08,199
only her unsteady gait belied her age.]

54
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,921
He added:

55
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:13,028
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker
knows the meaning of 'belied,'

56
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:16,260
and that it is the opposite
of how it is used in this sentence.

57
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:17,958
Come on! Get it together."

58
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:22,156
Belie: to give a false impression.

59
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,227
It should have been "betrayed."

60
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:28,301
E.B. White once wrote
of commas in The New Yorker:

61
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:33,189
"They fall with the precision
of knives outlining a body."

62
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,915
(Laughter)

63
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,745
And it's true -- we get a lot
of complaints about commas.

64
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:42,120
"Are there really two commas
in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"

65
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:47,827
There may not be on the sign, but yes,
that is New Yorker style for "Jr."

66
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,157
One wag wrote:

67
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:53,623
["Please, could you expel,
or, at least, restrain,

68
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,671
the comma-maniac,
on your editorial staff?"]

69
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,047
(Laughter)

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,222
Ah, well.

71
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,490
In this case, those commas
are well-placed,

72
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:03,385
except that there should not be one

73
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,411
between "maniac" and "on."

74
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,670
(Laughter)

75
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:10,442
Also, if we must have commas
around "at least,"

76
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:14,506
we might change it up
by using dashes around that phrase:

77
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,218
"... -- or, at least, restrain --"

78
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,562
Perfect.

79
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,164
(Applause)

80
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,523
Then there's this:

81
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:23,985
"Love you, love your magazine,

82
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,206
but can you please stop writing
massive numbers as text?"

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,784
[two and a half million ...]

84
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,967
No.

85
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,029
(Laughter)

86
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:37,155
One last cri de coeur
from a spelling stickler:

87
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:42,323
["Those long stringy things
are vocal cords, not chords."]

88
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,496
The outraged reader added,

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,353
"I'm sure I'm not the first to write

90
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:49,598
regarding this egregious
proofreading error,

91
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,028
but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.

92
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:53,272
Fie!"

93
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:55,517
(Laughter)

94
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,426
I used to like getting mail.

95
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,818
There is a pact
between writers and editors.

96
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,221
The editor never sells out the writer,

97
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:07,797
never goes public about bad jokes
that had to be cut

98
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:10,271
or stories that went on too long.

99
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:15,153
A great editor saves a writer
from her excesses.

100
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,586
Copy editors, too, have a code;

101
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,093
we don't advertise our oversights.

102
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:23,293
I feel disloyal divulging them here,

103
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:26,371
so let's have look at what we do right.

104
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,474
Somehow, I've gotten
a reputation for sternness.

105
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:35,250
But I work with writers who know
how to have their way with me.

106
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:39,889
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy,"
since the early 80s.

107
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:41,542
And he's one of my favorites,

108
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:44,011
even though he sometimes writes a sentence

109
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:46,131
that gives a copy editor pause.

110
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,380
Here is one from a story
about Staten Island

111
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:51,395
after Hurricane Sandy:

112
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:56,101
[A dock that had been broken
in the middle and lost its other half

113
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,509
sloped down toward the water,

114
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,213
its support pipes and wires
leaning forward

115
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,048
like when you open a box
of linguine and it slides out.]

116
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:07,326
(Laughter)

117
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,480
This would never have got past
the grammarian in the days of yore.

118
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,743
But what could I do?

119
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,371
Technically, the "like" should be an "as,"

120
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,839
but it sounds ridiculous,

121
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,576
as if the author were about to embark
on an extended Homeric simile --

122
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,371
"as when you open a box of linguine."

123
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:26,704
(Laughter)

124
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:31,504
I decided that the hurricane
conferred poetic justice on Sandy

125
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,179
and let the sentence stand.

126
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,290
(Laughter)

127
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:36,322
Generally, if I think something is wrong,

128
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,838
I query it three times.

129
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,717
I told Sandy that not long ago
in a moment of indiscretion and he said,

130
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,252
"Only three?"

131
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:45,020
So, he has learned to hold out.

132
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,443
Recently, he wrote a story
for "Talk of the Town,"

133
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,688
that's the section
at the front of the magazine

134
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:52,790
with short pieces on subjects
ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit

135
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:54,359
at the Metropolitan Museum

136
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:57,554
to the introduction
of doggie bags in France.

137
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:59,996
Sandy's story was about
the return to the Bronx

138
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,687
of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

139
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:05,260
There were three things
in it that I had to challenge.

140
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:06,848
First, a grammar query.

141
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:09,467
The justice was wearing black
and Sandy wrote,

142
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:14,567
[Her face and hands stood out
like in an old, mostly dark painting.]

143
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,993
Now, unlike with the hurricane,

144
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:19,485
with this "like," the author
didn't have the excuse

145
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,316
of describing hurricane damage.

146
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,636
"Like" in this sense is a preposition,
and a preposition takes an object,

147
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,853
which is a noun.

148
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:29,409
This "like" had to be an "as."

149
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,591
"As in an old, mostly dark painting."

150
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,265
Second, a spelling issue.

151
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:37,284
The author was quoting someone
who was assisting the justice:

152
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,408
["It will be just a minute.

153
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:42,073
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]

154
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,584
Mic'ed?

155
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,979
The music industry spells it "mic"

156
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:49,361
because that's how it's spelled
on the equipment.

157
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,812
I'd never seen it used
as a verb with this spelling,

158
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:54,366
and I was distraught
to think that "mic'ed"

159
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,675
would get into the magazine on my watch.

160
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:57,710
(Laughter)

161
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,653
New Yorker style for "microphone"
in its abbreviated form is "mike."

162
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,146
Finally, there was a sticky
grammar and usage issue

163
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,884
in which the pronoun has to have
the same grammatical number

164
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,359
as its antecedent.

165
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,887
[everyone in the vicinity
held their breath]

166
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:19,686
"Their" is plural and "everyone,"
its antecedent, is singular.

167
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,648
You would never say,
"Everyone were there."

168
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:26,513
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.

169
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:30,151
But people say things like,
"Everyone held their breath" all the time.

170
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,394
To give it legitimacy,

171
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,841
copy editors call it
"the singular 'their,'"

172
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:37,930
as if calling it singular
makes it no longer plural.

173
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,348
(Laughter)

174
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:44,571
It is my job when I see it in print
to do my best to eliminate it.

175
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,848
I couldn't make it,
"Everyone held her breath,"

176
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,564
or "Everyone held his breath,"

177
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:52,150
or "Everyone held his or her breath."

178
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,994
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.

179
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,374
I asked, through the editor,

180
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,446
if the author would consider changing it

181
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,041
to "All in the vicinity
held their breath,"

182
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,907
because "all" is plural.

183
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,088
Nope.

184
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:07,342
I tried again: "All those present
held their breath?"

185
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,587
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.

186
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:10,858
But the editor pointed out

187
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,287
that we could not have "present"
and "presence"

188
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,754
in the same sentence.

189
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,687
When the final proof came back,

190
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:19,287
the author had accepted "as" for "like,"

191
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:21,246
and "miked" for "mic'ed."

192
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,744
But on "Everyone held their breath,"
he stood his ground.

193
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,886
Two out of three isn't bad.

194
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,253
In the same issue,

195
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,799
in that piece on doggie bags in France,

196
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:35,561
there was the gratuitous use
of the f-word by a Frenchman.

197
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,864
I wonder, when the mail comes in,

198
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:41,746
which will have offended the readers more.

199
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,443
(Laughter)

200
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,618
Thank you.

201
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,994
(Applause)
