0
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:16,619
Two hundred years of modern science.

1
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:18,829
We have to admit

2
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,518
that our performance is not great.

3
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:24,331
The machines we build continue
to suffer from mechanical failures.

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,767
The houses we build
do not survive severe earthquakes.

5
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,764
But we shouldn't be so critical
of our scientists for a simple reason:

6
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,272
they didn't have much time.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,400
Two hundred years is not a lot of time,

8
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:41,647
while nature had three billion years

9
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:45,273
to perfect some of the most
amazing materials,

10
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,434
that we wish we had in our possession.

11
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:52,902
Remember, these materials
carry a quality assurance

12
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,810
of three billion years.

13
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,525
Take, for example, sequoia trees.

14
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:01,696
They carry hundreds of tons
for hundreds of years

15
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:05,161
in cold weather, in warm climates,

16
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:06,528
UV light.

17
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:11,125
Yet, if you look at the structure
by high-resolution electron microscopy,

18
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,172
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,

19
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,968
surprisingly, it's made of sugar.

20
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,801
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.

21
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:23,736
It's actually a nanofiber
called nanocrystalline cellulose.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,725
And this nanocrystalline cellulose
is so strong, on a weight basis,

23
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:33,068
it's about 10 times stronger than steel.

24
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,846
Yet it's made of sugar.

25
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,362
So scientists all over the world
believe that nanocellulose

26
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:43,598
is going to be one of the most important
materials for the entire industry.

27
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,772
But here's the problem:

28
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,797
say you want to buy
a half a ton of nanocellulose

29
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,440
to build a boat or an airplane.

30
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,392
Well, you can Google, you can eBay,
you can even Alibaba.

31
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:56,707
You won't find it.

32
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,795
Of course, you're going to find
thousands of scientific papers --

33
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,636
great papers, where scientists
are going to say this is a great material,

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,764
there are lots of things
we can do with it.

35
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:09,292
But no commercial source.

36
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:14,974
So we at the Hebrew University,
together with our partners in Sweden,

37
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:20,649
decided to focus on the development
of an industrial-scale process

38
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,347
to produce this nanocellulose.

39
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,595
And, of course,
we didn't want to cut trees.

40
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,950
So we were looking for another source

41
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,326
of raw material,

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,966
and we found one -- in fact,
the sludge of the paper industry.

43
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,582
The reason: there is a lot of it.

44
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,969
Europe alone produces 11 million tons

45
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,534
of that material annually.

46
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:49,054
It's the equivalent of a mountain
three kilometers high,

47
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:50,509
sitting on a soccer field.

48
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,263
And we produce this mountain every year.

49
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:57,170
So for everybody,
it's an environmental problem,

50
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,470
and for us, it's a gold mine.

51
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:05,085
So now, we are actually producing,
on an industrial scale in Israel,

52
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,660
nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.

53
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,834
We can do a lot of things
with the material.

54
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,233
For example,

55
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,092
we have shown that by adding
only a small percent of nanocellulose

56
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,913
into cotton fibers, the same
as my shirt is made of,

57
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,786
it increases its strength dramatically.

58
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:27,142
So this can be used
for making amazing things,

59
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:32,466
like super-fabrics for industrial
and medical applications.

60
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,913
But this is not the only thing.

61
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,791
For example, self-standing,
self-supporting structures,

62
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:41,411
like the shelters that you can see now,

63
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:46,234
actually are now showcasing
in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.

64
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:51,875
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders

65
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,001
in the plant kingdom.

66
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,491
Think about insects.

67
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:58,086
Cat fleas, for example,

68
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,950
have the ability to jump
about a hundred times their height.

69
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,319
That's amazing.

70
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,939
It's the equivalent of a person

71
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:10,406
standing in the middle
of Liberty Island in New York,

72
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,588
and in a single jump,

73
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,492
going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.

74
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,212
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.

75
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:20,535
So the question is:

76
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,520
How do cat fleas do it?

77
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,211
It turns out, they make
this wonderful material,

78
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:27,961
which is called resilin.

79
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:31,376
In simple words, resilin,
which is a protein,

80
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:36,145
is the most elastic rubber on Earth.

81
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,733
You can stretch it,

82
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,384
you can squish it,

83
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:44,699
and it doesn't lose almost any energy
to the environment.

84
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,532
When you release it -- snap!

85
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,181
It brings back all the energy.

86
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,092
So I'm sure everybody
would like to have that material.

87
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,488
But here's the problem:

88
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,418
to catch cat fleas is difficult.

89
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,384
(Laughter)

90
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,245
Why? Because they are jumpy.

91
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,790
(Laughter)

92
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:07,748
But now, it's actually
enough to catch one.

93
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,749
Now we can extract its DNA

94
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,881
and read how cat fleas make the resilin,

95
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,628
and clone it into a less-jumpy
organism like a plant.

96
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,354
So that's exactly what we did.

97
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:24,684
Now we have the ability
to produce lots of resilin.

98
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:29,097
Well, my team decided to do something
really cool at the university.

99
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:31,078
They decided to combine

100
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:34,324
the strongest material
produced by the plant kingdom

101
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:38,129
with the most elastic material
produced by the insect kingdom --

102
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,780
nanocellulose with resilin.

103
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,829
And the result is amazing.

104
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:49,184
This material, in fact, is tough,
elastic and transparent.

105
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,422
So there are lots of things
that can be done with this material.

106
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,596
For example, next-generation sport shoes,

107
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,407
so we can jump higher, run faster.

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,385
And even touch screens
for computers and smartphones,

109
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,783
that won't break.

110
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:08,791
Well, the problem is,
we continue to implant

111
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,903
synthetic implants in our body,

112
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,673
which we glue and screw into our body.

113
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:16,861
And I'm going to say
that this is not a good idea.

114
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,796
Why? Because they fail.

115
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,559
This synthetic material fails,

116
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,632
just like this plastic fork,

117
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,798
that is not strong enough
for its performance.

118
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,149
But sometimes they are too strong,

119
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,244
and therefore their mechanical
properties do not really fit

120
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,758
their surrounding tissues.

121
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:36,229
But in fact, the reason
is much more fundamental.

122
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,509
The reason is that in nature,

123
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,412
there is no one there

124
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:45,092
that actually takes my head
and screws it onto my neck,

125
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:48,401
or takes my skin
and glues it onto my body.

126
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,822
In nature, everything is self-assembled.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,470
So every living cell,

128
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:59,128
whether coming from a plant,
insect or human being,

129
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,235
has a DNA that encodes
for nanobio building blocks.

130
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,808
Many times they are proteins.

131
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:08,949
Other times, they are enzymes
that make other materials,

132
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:11,060
like polysaccharides, fatty acids.

133
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,427
And the common feature
about all these materials

134
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,883
is that they need no one.

135
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,606
They recognize each other
and self-assemble

136
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,529
into structures -- scaffolds
on which cells are proliferating

137
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:26,993
to give tissues.

138
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:30,204
They develop into organs,
and together bring life.

139
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:37,056
So we at the Hebrew University,
about 10 years ago, decided to focus

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,058
on probably the most important
biomaterial for humans,

141
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,291
which is collagen.

142
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:46,332
Why collagen?

143
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:50,070
Because collagen accounts for
about 25 percent of our dry weight.

144
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,698
We have nothing more than collagen,
other than water, in our body.

145
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:56,584
So I always like to say,

146
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:59,703
anyone who is in the replacement
parts of human beings

147
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,161
would like to have collagen.

148
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,687
Admittedly, before we started our project,

149
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:08,354
there were already more
than 1,000 medical implants

150
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:09,780
made of collagen.

151
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:13,660
You know, simple things like
dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,

152
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,063
augment lips,

153
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:19,356
and other, more sophisticated
medical implants, like heart valves.

154
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,306
So where is the problem?

155
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,806
Well, the problem is the source.

156
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,655
The source of all that collagen

157
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,621
is actually coming from dead bodies:

158
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,755
dead pigs, dead cows

159
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,858
and even human cadavers.

160
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,582
So safety is a big issue.

161
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,185
But it's not the only one.

162
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,003
Also, the quality.

163
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,010
Now here, I have a personal interest.

164
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:47,208
This is my father, Zvi,
in our winery in Israel.

165
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,954
A heart valve, very similar
to the one that I showed you before,

166
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,751
seven years ago,
was implanted in his body.

167
00:08:55,941 --> 00:09:01,077
Now, the scientific literature says
that these heart valves start to fail

168
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,144
10 years after the operation.

169
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,660
No wonder:

170
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,791
they are made from old, used tissues,

171
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:14,156
just like this wall made of bricks
that is falling apart.

172
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:18,219
Yeah, of course, I can take
those bricks and build a new wall.

173
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,646
But it's not going to be the same.

174
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,132
So the US Food and Drug Administration

175
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,275
made a notice already in 2007,

176
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:31,346
asking the companies to start to look
for better alternatives.

177
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,938
So that's exactly what we did.

178
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:39,534
We decided to clone all the five
human genes responsible

179
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,783
for making type I collagen in humans

180
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,926
into a transgenic tobacco plant.

181
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:53,224
So now, the plant has the ability
to make human collagen brand new,

182
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,404
untouched.

183
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,661
This is amazing.

184
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,176
Actually, it's happening now.

185
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,015
Today in Israel, we grow it
in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses

186
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,284
all over the country.

187
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,517
The farmers receive
small plantlets of tobacco.

188
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,491
It looks exactly like regular tobacco,

189
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,046
except that they have five human genes.

190
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,771
They're responsible for making
type I collagen.

191
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:19,620
We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,

192
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:21,850
we harvest the leaves,

193
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,405
and then the leaves are transported
by cooling trucks to the factory.

194
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,040
There, the process of extracting
the collagen starts.

195
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:34,042
Now, if you ever made a pesto --
essentially, the same thing.

196
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,582
(Laughter)

197
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:40,387
You crush the leaves, you get
the juice that contains the collagen.

198
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,305
We concentrate the protein,

199
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,596
transfer the protein to clean rooms
for the final purification,

200
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,940
and the end result is a collagen
identical to what we have in our body --

201
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,655
untouched, brand new

202
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:56,737
and from which we make
different medical implants:

203
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,111
bone void fillers, for example,

204
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:04,433
for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.

205
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,633
And more recently, even,

206
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:11,029
we've been able to launch
into the market here in Europe

207
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,133
a flowable gel that is used
for diabetic foot ulcers,

208
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,794
that is now approved
for use in the clinic.

209
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,351
This is not science fiction.

210
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,367
This is happening now.

211
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,937
We are using plants
to make medical implants

212
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,969
for replacement parts for human beings.

213
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,071
In fact, more recently,
we've been able to make collagen fibers

214
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:37,392
which are six times stronger
than the Achilles tendon.

215
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,117
That's amazing.

216
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:42,023
Together with our partners from Ireland,

217
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,762
we thought about the next thing:

218
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,358
adding resilin to those fibers.

219
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:48,608
By doing that,

220
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:51,430
we've been able to make a superfiber

221
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:54,428
which is about 380 percent tougher,

222
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:57,487
and 300 percent more elastic.

223
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,591
So oddly enough, in the future,

224
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:05,575
when a patient is transplanted
with artificial tendons or ligaments

225
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,329
made from these fibers,

226
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,932
we'll have better performance
after the surgery

227
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,685
than we had before the injury.

228
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,367
So what's for the future?

229
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,392
In the future, we believe
we'll be able to make

230
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,993
many nanobio building blocks
that nature provided for us --

231
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:25,857
collagen, nanocellulose,
resilin and many more.

232
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,073
And that will enable us to make
better machines perform better,

233
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,279
even the heart.

234
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,097
Now, this heart
is not going to be the same

235
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,263
as we can get from a donor.

236
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,286
It will be better.

237
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,866
It actually will perform better

238
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,191
and will last longer.

239
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,390
My friend Zion Suliman once told me

240
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,627
a smart sentence.

241
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,338
He said, "If you want a new idea,

242
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,991
you should open an old book."

243
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:56,933
And I'm going to say
that the book was written.

244
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,956
It was written over three billion years

245
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,137
of evolution.

246
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,621
And the text is the DNA of life.

247
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:07,137
All we have to do

248
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,196
is read this text,

249
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,713
embrace nature's gift to us

250
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,725
and start our progress from here.

251
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,413
Thank you.

252
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:20,317
(Applause)
