0
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,770
Whenever I get to travel for work,

1
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,302
I try to find out where my
drinking water comes from,

2
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:18,993
and where my poop and pee go.

3
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,861
(Laughter)

4
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:23,912
This has earned me the nickname
"The Poo Princess" in my family,

5
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:27,913
and it's ruined many family vacations,
because this is not normal.

6
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:33,873
But thinking about where it all goes
is the first step in activating

7
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,712
what are actually superpowers
in our poop and pee.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,812
(Laughter)

9
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:38,990
Yeah.

10
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,172
And if we use them well,

11
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,347
we can live healthier
and more beautifully.

12
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,992
Check out this landscape
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

13
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:49,913
Just notice what kinds of words
and feelings come to mind.

14
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:55,271
This landscape was watered
with treated sewage water.

15
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,652
Does that change anything for you?

16
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,716
I imagine it might.

17
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,482
And that's OK.

18
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,094
How we feel about this

19
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,565
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

20
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:14,169
And I want to explain how it works,

21
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,638
but what words do I use?

22
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:21,123
I mean, I can use profane words
like "shit" and "piss,"

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,427
and then my grandma won't watch the video.

24
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,831
Or I can use childish words
like "poo" and "pee." Eh.

25
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:31,970
Or I can use scientific words
like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.

26
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,261
I'll use a mix.

27
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,625
(Laughter)

28
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:37,654
It's all I got. (Laughs)

29
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:39,171
So, in this suburb,

30
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:43,120
the poo and the pee and the wash water
are going to this treatment plant

31
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,261
right in the middle of the community.

32
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,946
It looks more like a park
than a treatment plant.

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,356
The poo at the very bottom
of all those layers of gravel --

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,896
not touching anyone --

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,661
is providing solid food
for those marsh plants.

36
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:59,519
And the clean, clear water
that comes out the other end

37
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:03,304
is traveling underground
to water each person's yard.

38
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,023
So even though they're in a desert,

39
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:06,904
they get their own personal oasis.

40
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:11,175
This approach is called
Integrated Water Management,

41
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,579
or holistic or closed-loop.

42
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,588
Whatever you want to call it,

43
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,247
it's in conflict with the status quo
of how we think about sanitation,

44
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,599
which is contain, treat, push it away.

45
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,585
But in this approach,
we're doing one step better.

46
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,971
We're designing for reuse
from the very beginning,

47
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,563
because everything does get reused,

48
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,741
only now we're planning for it.

49
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,397
And often, that makes for
really beautiful spaces.

50
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:41,107
But the most important thing
about this system

51
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,130
isn't the technicals of how it works.

52
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,440
It's how you feel about it.

53
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,995
Do you want this in your yard?

54
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,705
Why not?

55
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:53,087
I got really curious about this question.

56
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:56,451
Why don't we see more
innovation in sanitation?

57
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,974
Why isn't that kind of thing
the new normal?

58
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,790
And I care so much about this question,

59
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,973
that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.

60
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,901
We want to accelerate adoption

61
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:08,697
of sustainable building
and development practices.

62
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,465
We want more innovation.

63
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:15,351
But a lot of times,
whole categories of innovation --

64
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,173
ones that can help us
live more beautifully --

65
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,568
turn out to be illegal.

66
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:24,180
Today's regulations and codes
were written under the assumption

67
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,218
that best practices
would remain best practices,

68
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,498
with incremental updates forever and ever.

69
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,736
But innovation isn't always incremental.

70
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:37,766
It turns out, how we feel
about any particular new technique

71
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,639
gets into everything we do:

72
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,933
how we talk about it,

73
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,783
how we encourage people to study,

74
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,730
our jokes, our codes ...

75
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,701
And it ultimately determines
how innovative we can be.

76
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:52,510
So, that's the first reason
we don't innovate in sanitation.

77
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,392
We're kind of uncomfortable
talking about sanitation,

78
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,118
that's why I've gotten called
"The Poo Princess" so much.

79
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,833
The second reason is:

80
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:03,387
we think the problem is solved
here in the US.

81
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,063
But not so.

82
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:10,129
Here in the US we still get sick
from drinking shit in our sewage water.

83
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,844
Seven million people get sick every year,

84
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,639
900 die annually.

85
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:17,853
And we're not taking a holistic
approach to making it better.

86
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,782
So we're not solving it.

87
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:23,424
Where I live in Portland, Oregon,

88
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:26,251
I can't take Echo for a swim
during the rainy season,

89
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,383
because we dump raw sewage
sometimes into our river.

90
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:33,130
Our rainwater and our sewage
go to the same treatment plant.

91
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:36,896
Too much rain overflows into the river.

92
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,545
And Portland is not alone here.

93
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,659
Forty percent of municipalities self-report

94
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,512
dumping raw or partially treated
sewage into our waterways.

95
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:50,600
The other bummer going on here
with our status quo

96
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,181
is that half of all of your poop and pee
is going to fertilize farmland.

97
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,185
The other half is being incinerated

98
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,423
or land-filled.

99
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,955
And that's a bummer to me,

100
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,941
because there are amazing nutrients
in your daily doody.

101
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:06,131
It is comparable to pig manure;

102
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,432
we're omnivores, they're omnivores.

103
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,623
Think of your poo and pee
as a health smoothie for a tree.

104
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:16,470
(Laughter)

105
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,166
The other bummer going on here

106
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,205
is that we're quickly moving
all the drugs we take into our waterways.

107
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:28,202
The average wastewater treatment plant
can remove maybe half of the drugs

108
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,439
that come in.

109
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,540
The other half goes
right out the other side.

110
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:36,020
Consider what a cocktail
of pharmaceuticals --

111
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,065
hormones, steroids, Vicodin --

112
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,872
does to a fish,

113
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,118
to a dog,

114
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,342
to a child.

115
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:47,802
But this isn't just some problem
that we need to contain.

116
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,613
If we flip this around,
we can create a resource

117
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:53,313
that can solve so many
of our other problems.

118
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,138
And I want to get you
comfortable with this idea,

119
00:05:56,162 --> 00:06:00,311
so imagine the things I'm going
to show you, these technologies,

120
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,324
and this attitude that says,

121
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:03,696
"We're going to reuse this.

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,934
Let's design to make it beautiful" --

123
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,491
as advanced potty training.

124
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,538
(Laughter)

125
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,288
I think you're ready for it.

126
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,684
I think we as a culture are ready
for advanced potty training.

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,006
And there are three great
reasons to enroll today.

128
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,310
Number one:

129
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:20,992
we can fertilize our food.

130
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,528
Each one of us is pooping
and peeing something

131
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:26,291
that could fertilize half
or maybe all of our food,

132
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:27,758
depending on our diet.

133
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,335
That dark brown poo in the toilet
is dark brown because of what?

134
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,747
Dead stuff, bacteria.

135
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:35,400
That's carbon.

136
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,730
And carbon, if we're getting
that into the soil,

137
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:40,785
is going to bind to the other minerals
and nutrients in there.

138
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,112
Boom! Healthier food.

139
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:45,323
Voilà! Healthier people.

140
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,866
Chemical fertilizers by definition
don't have carbon in them.

141
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:56,584
Imagine if we could move our animal manure
and our human manure to our soil,

142
00:06:56,608 --> 00:07:00,414
we might not need to rely
on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,

143
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:02,409
mine minerals from far away.

144
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,863
Imagine how much energy we could save.

145
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,290
Now, some of us are concerned

146
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:14,255
about industrial pollutants
contaminating this reuse cycle.

147
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,975
That can be addressed.

148
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:22,379
But we need to separate our discomfort
about talking about poo and pee

149
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:26,767
so we can calmly talk
about how we want to reuse it

150
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,432
and what things we don't want to reuse.

151
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,612
And get this:

152
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,393
if we change our approach to sanitation,

153
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,072
we can start to slow down climate change.

154
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,136
Remember that carbon in the poop?

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,850
If we can get that into our soil bank,

156
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:47,687
it's going to start to absorb
carbon dioxide that we put into the air.

157
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:50,464
And that could help
slow down global warming.

158
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:53,904
I want to show you some brave souls

159
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:58,234
who've had the courage to embrace
this advanced potty training approach.

160
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,719
So those folks in New Mexico --

161
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:02,123
why did they do it?

162
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,414
'Cause they're in a desert?
'Cause they save money? Yeah.

163
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:08,833
But more importantly,
they felt comfortable

164
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:13,060
seeing what was going
down the toilet as a resource.

165
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:15,738
Here's an average house
in Portland, Oregon.

166
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,699
This house is special
because they have a composting toilet

167
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:22,840
turning all their poo and pee,
over time, into a soil amendment.

168
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:26,441
Their wash water, their shower water,
is going underground

169
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,353
to a series of mulch basins,

170
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,495
and then watering that orchard downhill.

171
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:34,247
When they went to get this permitted,

172
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,564
it wasn't allowed in Oregon.

173
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,728
But it was allowed
in five other states nearby.

174
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:44,394
That was Recode's -- my organization's --
first code-change campaign.

175
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,620
Here's a great example where
the Integrated Water Management approach

176
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,084
was the cheapest.

177
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:56,704
This is three high-rise residential
buildings in downtown Portland,

178
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:59,308
and they're not flushing
to the sewer system.

179
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,491
How?

180
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:04,437
Well, their wash water
is getting reused to flush toilets,

181
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,128
cool mechanical systems,

182
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:07,460
water the landscape.

183
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,882
And then once the building
has thoroughly used everything --

184
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:12,429
aka, shat in it --

185
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:17,075
it's treated to highest standard
right on-site by plants and bacteria,

186
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,544
and then infiltrated
into the groundwater right below.

187
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:24,874
And all that was cheaper

188
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,801
than updating the surrounding
sewer infrastructure.

189
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:31,091
So that's the last reason
we should get really excited

190
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:32,607
about doing things differently:

191
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,826
we can save a lot of money.

192
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,968
This was the first permit
of its kind in Oregon.

193
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:43,758
Brave and open-minded people
sat down and felt comfortable saying,

194
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,910
"Yeah, that shit makes sense."

195
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,402
(Laughter)

196
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:49,667
"Let's do it."

197
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:50,692
(Applause)

198
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,867
You know?

199
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,040
I keep showing examples

200
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:56,222
where everyone's reusing
everything on-site.

201
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:57,397
Why?

202
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:00,695
Well, when we look at our aging
infrastructure -- and it is old --

203
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,622
and we look at the cost of updating it,

204
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:07,253
three-quarters of that cost is just
the pipes snaking through our city.

205
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,845
So as we build anew, as we renovate,

206
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:14,741
it might make more sense
to treat and reuse everything on-site.

207
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,070
San Francisco realized that it made sense

208
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:20,768
to invest in rebates for every household

209
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,325
to reuse their wash water
and their rainwater

210
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:24,982
to water the backyard,

211
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:29,073
because the amount of water they would
save as a community would be so big.

212
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,748
But why were all
these projects so innovative?

213
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,026
The money piece, yeah.

214
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,614
But more importantly,

215
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,970
they felt comfortable with this idea
of advanced potty training.

216
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:46,600
Imagine if we embraced
innovation for sanitation

217
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:49,922
the way we have for, say, solar power.

218
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:54,120
Think about it -- solar power used
to be uncommon and unaffordable.

219
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:57,697
Now it's more a part
of our web of power than ever before.

220
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,704
And it's creating resiliency.

221
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,964
We now have sources of power like the sun

222
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:05,444
that don't vary with our earthly dramas.

223
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,443
What's driving all that innovation?

224
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,376
It's us.

225
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,423
We're talking about energy.

226
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,818
It's cool to talk about energy.

227
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:18,183
Some folks are even talking
about the problems

228
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:21,373
with the limited resources
where our current energy is coming from.

229
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:25,461
We encourage our best and brightest
to work on this issue --

230
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,677
better solar panels,
better batteries, everything.

231
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:33,209
So let's talk about where
our drinking water is coming from,

232
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,824
where our poo and pee are actually going.

233
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:41,284
If we can get over this discomfort
with this entire topic,

234
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,364
we could create something
that creates our future goldmine.

235
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:46,779
Every time you flush the toilet,

236
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:48,422
I want you to think,

237
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,470
"Where is my poop and pee going?

238
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,397
Will they be gainfully employed?"

239
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,673
(Laughter)

240
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,875
"Or are they going to be wreaking
havoc in some waterway?"

241
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,802
If you don't know, find out.

242
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,604
And if you don't like the answer,

243
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:04,355
figure out how you can communicate
to those who can drive this change

244
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,391
that you have advanced potty training,
that you are ready for reuse.

245
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,842
How all of you feel

246
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:14,167
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

247
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,350
Thank you so much.

248
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:20,851
(Applause)
