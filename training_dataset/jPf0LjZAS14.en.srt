0
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,091
I'm a journalist,

1
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,666
so I like to look for the untold stories,

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,396
the lives that quietly play out
under the scream of headlines.

3
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:24,434
I've also been going about the business
of putting down roots,

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,762
choosing a partner, making babies.

5
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:29,437
So for the last few years,

6
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,924
I've been trying to understand

7
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,396
what constitutes
the 21st-century good life,

8
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:39,695
both because I'm fascinated by the moral
and philosophical implications,

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,799
but also because I'm in desperate
need of answers myself.

10
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,933
We live in tenuous times.

11
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:49,587
In fact, for the first time
in American history,

12
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:53,731
the majority of parents do not think
that their kids will be better off

13
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:55,187
than they were.

14
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,489
This is true of rich and poor,
men and women.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,565
Now, some of you
might hear this and feel sad.

16
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,581
After all, America is deeply invested

17
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,484
in this idea of economic transcendence,

18
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:11,068
that every generation kind of
leapfrogs the one before it,

19
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:14,790
earning more, buying more, being more.

20
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,457
We've exported this dream
all over the world,

21
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:20,390
so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya

22
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,783
inherit our insatiable expectation

23
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,354
for more.

24
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:28,120
But when I read this historic poll
for the first time,

25
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:30,117
it didn't actually make me feel sad.

26
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,339
It felt like a provocation.

27
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,014
"Better off" -- based on whose standards?

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,113
Is "better off" finding a secure job

29
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,628
that you can count on
for the rest of your life?

30
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:43,764
Those are nearly extinct.

31
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:47,785
People move jobs, on average,
every 4,7 years,

32
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,770
and it's estimated that by 2020,

33
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:52,650
nearly half of Americans
will be freelancers.

34
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:56,474
OK, so is better off just a number?

35
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:59,465
Is it about earning
as much as you possibly can?

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,292
By that singular measurement,
we are failing.

37
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:07,513
Median per capita income
has been flat since about 2000,

38
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:09,099
adjusted for inflation.

39
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,234
All right, so is better off getting
a big house with a white picket fence?

40
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,147
Less of us are doing that.

41
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:20,374
Nearly five million people lost
their homes in the Great Recession,

42
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:24,772
and even more of us sobered up
about the lengths we were willing to go --

43
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,543
or be tricked into going,
in many predatory cases --

44
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,074
to hold that deed.

45
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,258
Home-ownership rates
are at their lowest since 1995.

46
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:37,465
All right, so we're not
finding steady employment,

47
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,222
we're not earning as much money,

48
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,658
and we're not living in big fancy houses.

49
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:44,087
Toll the funeral bells

50
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,680
for everything that made America great.

51
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,299
But,

52
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:53,673
are those the best measurements
of a country's greatness,

53
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:55,198
of a life well lived?

54
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,455
What I think makes America great
is its spirit of reinvention.

55
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,752
In the wake of the Great Recession,

56
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:05,933
more and more Americans are redefining
what "better off" really means.

57
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:10,398
Turns out, it has more to do
with community and creativity

58
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:12,107
than dollars and cents.

59
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,956
Now, let me be very clear:

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,673
the 14,8 percent of Americans
living in poverty need money,

61
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,077
plain and simple.

62
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,762
And all of us need policies
that protect us from exploitation

63
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,987
by employers and financial institutions.

64
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:33,662
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest
that the gap between rich and poor

65
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:37,057
is anything but profoundly immoral.

66
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,529
But,

67
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,192
too often we let
the conversation stop there.

68
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:46,529
We talk about poverty as if
it were a monolithic experience;

69
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:49,300
about the poor as if
they were solely victims.

70
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,983
Part of what I've learned
in my research and reporting

71
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,413
is that the art of living well

72
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:58,425
is often practiced most masterfully

73
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,555
by the most vulnerable.

74
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,745
Now, if necessity
is the mother of invention,

75
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,467
I've come to believe

76
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,308
that recession can be
the father of consciousness.

77
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,717
It confronts us with profound questions,

78
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,884
questions we might be too lazy
or distracted to ask

79
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,581
in times of relative comfort.

80
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,610
How should we work?

81
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,947
How should we live?

82
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,005
All of us, whether we realize it or not,

83
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,601
seek answers to these questions,

84
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,790
with our ancestors
kind of whispering in our ears.

85
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,143
My great-grandfather
was a drunk in Detroit,

86
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,730
who sometimes managed
to hold down a factory job.

87
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,527
He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,

88
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:43,422
21 children,

89
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,828
with one woman, my great-grandmother,

90
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,252
who died at 47 years old
of ovarian cancer.

91
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,880
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,

92
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:56,478
and I cannot even fathom
what she must have gone through.

93
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:00,088
And if you're trying to do the math --
there were six sets of twins.

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,548
So my grandfather, their son,

95
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,271
became a traveling salesman,

96
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,790
and he lived boom and bust.

97
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:10,500
So my dad grew up answering
the door for debt collectors

98
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:12,519
and pretending his parents weren't home.

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,159
He actually took his braces off himself
with pliers in the garage,

100
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,342
when his father admitted
he didn't have money

101
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,040
to go back to the orthodontist.

102
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:24,549
So my dad, unsurprisingly,

103
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,641
became a bankruptcy lawyer.

104
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,713
Couldn't write this in a novel, right?

105
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:32,517
He was obsessed with providing
a secure foundation

106
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,887
for my brother and I.

107
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:38,268
So I ask these questions
by way of a few generations of struggle.

108
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:41,952
My parents made sure that I grew up
on a kind of steady ground

109
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:45,293
that allows one to question
and risk and leap.

110
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,223
And ironically, and probably
sometimes to their frustration,

111
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,531
it is their steadfast
commitment to security

112
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:55,020
that allows me to question its value,

113
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:58,022
or at least its value
as we've historically defined it

114
00:05:58,046 --> 00:05:59,759
in the 21st century.

115
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,854
So let's dig into this first question:

116
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:05,048
How should we work?

117
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:09,008
We should work like our mothers.

118
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,893
That's right -- we've spent decades

119
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:15,947
trying to fit women into a work world
built for company men.

120
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,248
And many have done backbends to fit in,

121
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,897
but others have carved
a more unconventional path,

122
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:23,851
creating a patchwork of meaning and money

123
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,596
with enough flexibility
to do what they need to do

124
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,286
for those that they love.

125
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,159
My mom called it "just making it work."

126
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:35,043
Today I hear life coaches
call it "a portfolio career."

127
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,615
Whatever you call it,

128
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,708
more and more men are craving
these whole, if not harried, lives.

129
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:47,690
They're waking up to their desire
and duty to be present fathers and sons.

130
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,984
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,

131
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,523
"Labor is a way of knowing."

132
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,746
Labor is a way of knowing.

133
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,778
In other words, what we work on

134
00:06:57,802 --> 00:07:00,305
is what we understand about the world.

135
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,242
If this is true, and I think it is,

136
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:06,838
then women who have disproportionately
cared for the little ones

137
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,839
and the sick ones and the aging ones,

138
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,795
have disproportionately benefited

139
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,349
from the most profound kind
of knowing there is:

140
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,518
knowing the human condition.

141
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,594
By prioritizing care,

142
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:23,194
men are, in a sense, staking their claim

143
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,121
to the full range of human existence.

144
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:30,233
Now, this means the nine-to-five
no longer works for anyone.

145
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:33,511
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,
as are career ladders.

146
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,603
Whole industries are being born
and dying every day.

147
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,558
It's all nonlinear from here.

148
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,102
So we need to stop asking kids,

149
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,182
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

150
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,510
and start asking them,
"How do you want to be when you grow up?"

151
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,146
Their work will constantly change.

152
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,145
The common denominator is them.

153
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,445
So the more they understand their gifts

154
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,924
and create crews of ideal collaborators,

155
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,788
the better off they will be.

156
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:01,380
The challenge ahead is to reinvent
the social safety net

157
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,341
to fit this increasingly
fragmented economy.

158
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,224
We need portable health benefits.

159
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,857
We need policies that reflect
that everyone deserves to be vulnerable

160
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,379
or care for vulnerable others,

161
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,011
without becoming destitute.

162
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,683
We need to seriously consider
a universal basic income.

163
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,904
We need to reinvent labor organizing.

164
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:22,548
The promise of a work world
that is structured to actually fit

165
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,472
our 21st century values,

166
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,433
not some archaic idea
about bringing home the bacon,

167
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,647
is long overdue --

168
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,054
just ask your mother.

169
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,579
Now, how about the second question:

170
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,832
How should we live?

171
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,483
We should live

172
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,579
like our immigrant ancestors.

173
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,611
When they came to America,

174
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:46,865
they often shared apartments,
survival tactics, child care --

175
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,895
always knew how to fill one more belly,

176
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,179
no matter how small the food available.

177
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,336
But they were told that success meant
leaving the village behind

178
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,412
and pursuing that iconic symbol
of the American Dream,

179
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,912
the white picket fence.

180
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,484
And even today,
we see a white picket fence

181
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,881
and we think success, self-possession.

182
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,136
But when you strip away
the sentimentality,

183
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,536
what it really does is divides us.

184
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,713
Many Americans are rejecting
the white picket fence

185
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:16,052
and the kind of highly privatized life
that happened within it,

186
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,866
and reclaiming village life,

187
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,470
reclaiming interdependence instead.

188
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,914
Fifty million of us, for example,

189
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,613
live in intergenerational households.

190
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:28,746
This number exploded
with the Great Recession,

191
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,408
but it turns out people
actually like living this way.

192
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:35,280
Two-thirds of those who are living
with multiple generations under one roof

193
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:37,673
say it's improved their relationships.

194
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,969
Some people are choosing
to share homes not with family,

195
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,353
but with other people who understand
the health and economic benefits

196
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:46,058
of daily community.

197
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:49,716
CoAbode, an online platform
for single moms looking to share homes

198
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,103
with other single moms,

199
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,118
has 50,000 users.

200
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,398
And people over 65 are especially prone

201
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,571
to be looking for these alternative
living arrangements.

202
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,573
They understand that their quality of life

203
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:06,846
depends on a mix
of solitude and solidarity.

204
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:10,220
Which is true of all of us
when you think about it,

205
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,608
young and old alike.

206
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:15,663
For too long, we've pretended
that happiness is a king in his castle.

207
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,477
But all the research proves otherwise.

208
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,009
It shows that the healthiest,
happiest and even safest --

209
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:28,107
in terms of both climate change disaster,
in terms of crime, all of that --

210
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:31,963
are Americans who live lives
intertwined with their neighbors.

211
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,558
Now, I've experienced this firsthand.

212
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:38,268
For the last few years, I've been living
in a cohousing community.

213
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:41,901
It's 1,5 acres of persimmon trees,

214
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,677
this prolific blackberry bush
that snakes around a community garden,

215
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,914
all smack-dab, by the way,
in the middle of urban Oakland.

216
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,566
The nine units are all built
to be different,

217
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,239
different sizes, different shapes,

218
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,377
but they're meant to be
as green as possible.

219
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,544
So big, shiny black
solar cells on our roof

220
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:59,502
mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds

221
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,144
more than five bucks in a month.

222
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,598
The 25 of us who live there are all
different ages and political persuasions

223
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:06,780
and professions,

224
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:10,082
and we live in homes that have everything
a typical home would have.

225
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,260
But additionally,

226
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,800
we share an industrial-sized
kitchen and eating area,

227
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,889
where we have common meals twice a week.

228
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:18,152
Now, people, when I tell them
I live like this,

229
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,082
often have one of two extreme reactions.

230
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,755
Either they say, "Why doesn't
everyone live like this?"

231
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,507
Or they say, "That sounds
totally horrifying.

232
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,030
I would never want to do that."

233
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:32,201
So let me reassure you: there is
a sacred respect for privacy among us,

234
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:36,931
but also a commitment to what we call
"radical hospitality" --

235
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:39,958
not the kind advertised
by the Four Seasons,

236
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:46,331
but the kind that says that every
single person is worthy of kindness,

237
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,113
full stop, end of sentence.

238
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:52,606
The biggest surprise for me
of living in a community like this?

239
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:57,086
You share all the domestic labor --
the repairing, the cooking, the weeding --

240
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,173
but you also share the emotional labor.

241
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,596
Rather than depending only
on the idealized family unit

242
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,488
to get all of your emotional needs met,

243
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,921
you have two dozen other people
that you can go to

244
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,781
to talk about a hard day at work

245
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:11,490
or troubleshoot how to handle
an abusive teacher.

246
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:17,602
Teenagers in our community will often go
to an adult that is not their parent

247
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,885
to ask for advice.

248
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,829
It's what bell hooks
called "revolutionary parenting,"

249
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,651
this humble acknowledgment

250
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,771
that kids are healthier when they have
a wider range of adults

251
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,635
to emulate and count on.

252
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,052
Turns out, adults are healthier, too.

253
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,156
It's a lot of pressure,

254
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,084
trying to be that perfect family
behind that white picket fence.

255
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,634
The "new better off,"
as I've come to call it,

256
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:45,614
is less about investing
in the perfect family

257
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:49,123
and more about investing
in the imperfect village,

258
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,373
whether that's relatives
living under one roof,

259
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,237
a cohousing community like mine,

260
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,191
or just a bunch of neighbors
who pledge to really know

261
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:57,721
and look out for one another.

262
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,003
It's good common sense, right?

263
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:03,273
And yet, money has often made us dumb

264
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,662
about reaching out.

265
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,608
The most reliable wealth

266
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:10,191
is found in relationship.

267
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:14,731
The new better off is not
an individual prospect at all.

268
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,453
In fact, if you're a failure
or you think you're a failure,

269
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,088
I've got some good news for you:

270
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:23,902
you might be a success by standards
you have not yet honored.

271
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,810
Maybe you're a mediocre earner
but a masterful father.

272
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,359
Maybe you can't afford your dream home,

273
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:33,089
but you throw legendary
neighborhood parties.

274
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:36,226
If you're a textbook success,

275
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,741
the implications of what I'm saying
could be more grim for you.

276
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:43,685
You might be a failure
by standards you hold dear

277
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,111
but that the world doesn't reward.

278
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,119
Only you can know.

279
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,526
I know that I am not a tribute

280
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,036
to my great-grandmother,

281
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,729
who lived such a short and brutish life,

282
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,916
if I earn enough money to afford
every creature comfort.

283
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:03,743
You can't buy your way
out of suffering or into meaning.

284
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,501
There is no home big enough

285
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,547
to erase the pain
that she must have endured.

286
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,685
I am a tribute to her

287
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:15,156
if I live a life as connected
and courageous as possible.

288
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,257
In the midst of such
widespread uncertainty,

289
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,494
we may, in fact, be insecure.

290
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,860
But we can let that insecurity
make us brittle

291
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,375
or supple.

292
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:31,866
We can turn inward, lose faith
in the power of institutions to change --

293
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,804
even lose faith in ourselves.

294
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,736
Or we can turn outward,

295
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,385
cultivate faith in our ability
to reach out, to connect, to create.

296
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:45,457
Turns out, the biggest danger

297
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,878
is not failing to achieve
the American Dream.

298
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,062
The biggest danger is achieving a dream

299
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,449
that you don't actually believe in.

300
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,592
So don't do that.

301
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,688
Do the harder, more interesting thing,

302
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,760
which is to compose a life
where what you do every single day,

303
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:07,462
the people you give your best love
and ingenuity and energy to,

304
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,496
aligns as closely as possible
with what you believe.

305
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,415
That, not something as mundane
as making money,

306
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,408
is a tribute to your ancestors.

307
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:20,043
That is the beautiful struggle.

308
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:22,052
Thank you.

309
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:31,255
(Applause)
