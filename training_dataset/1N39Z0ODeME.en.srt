0
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:15,021
Cancer affects all of us --

1
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,412
especially the ones that come
back over and over again,

2
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,432
the highly invasive
and drug-resistant ones,

3
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,835
the ones that defy medical treatment,

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,375
even when we throw our best drugs at them.

5
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:30,167
Engineering at the molecular level,

6
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,839
working at the smallest of scales,

7
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,386
can provide exciting new ways

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,338
to fight the most aggressive
forms of cancer.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,737
Cancer is a very clever disease.

10
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,923
There are some forms of cancer,

11
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:48,682
which, fortunately, we've learned
how to address relatively well

12
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:52,098
with known and established
drugs and surgery.

13
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:54,604
But there are some forms of cancer

14
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,860
that don't respond to these approaches,

15
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:59,512
and the tumor survives or comes back,

16
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,665
even after an onslaught of drugs.

17
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:06,047
We can think of these
very aggressive forms of cancer

18
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,937
as kind of supervillains in a comic book.

19
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,160
They're clever, they're adaptable,

20
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,993
and they're very good at staying alive.

21
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:18,406
And, like most supervillains these days,

22
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,906
their superpowers come
from a genetic mutation.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,682
The genes that are modified
inside these tumor cells

24
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:32,973
can enable and encode for new
and unimagined modes of survival,

25
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:35,472
allowing the cancer cell to live through

26
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,861
even our best chemotherapy treatments.

27
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:43,296
One example is a trick
in which a gene allows a cell,

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,804
even as the drug approaches the cell,

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,039
to push the drug out,

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,023
before the drug can have any effect.

31
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:55,733
Imagine -- the cell effectively
spits out the drug.

32
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:59,323
This is just one example
of the many genetic tricks

33
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:01,947
in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.

34
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:04,131
All due to mutant genes.

35
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:09,438
So, we have a supervillain
with incredible superpowers.

36
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,584
And we need a new and powerful
mode of attack.

37
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:16,788
Actually, we can turn off a gene.

38
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:20,669
The key is a set of molecules
known as siRNA.

39
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:24,746
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code

40
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,334
that guide a cell to block a certain gene.

41
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,557
Each siRNA molecule
can turn off a specific gene

42
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,151
inside the cell.

43
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,313
For many years since its discovery,

44
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:39,287
scientists have been very excited

45
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,668
about how we can apply
these gene blockers in medicine.

46
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:44,934
But, there is a problem.

47
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,418
siRNA works well inside the cell.

48
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,848
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes

49
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,372
that reside in our bloodstream
or our tissues,

50
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,251
it degrades within seconds.

51
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,085
It has to be packaged, protected
through its journey through the body

52
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,179
on its way to the final target
inside the cancer cell.

53
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,057
So, here's our strategy.

54
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:10,271
First, we'll dose the cancer cell
with siRNA, the gene blocker,

55
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,891
and silence those survival genes,

56
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,003
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.

57
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,179
But how do we carry that out?

58
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,544
Using molecular engineering,

59
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,893
we can actually design a superweapon

60
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,899
that can travel through the bloodstream.

61
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,919
It has to be tiny enough
to get through the bloodstream,

62
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,814
it's got to be small enough
to penetrate the tumor tissue,

63
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:36,513
and it's got to be tiny enough
to be taken up inside the cancer cell.

64
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,651
To do this job well,

65
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:43,480
it has to be about one one-hundredth
the size of a human hair.

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,605
Let's take a closer look
at how we can build this nanoparticle.

67
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,543
First, let's start
with the nanoparticle core.

68
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:55,367
It's a tiny capsule that contains
the chemotherapy drug.

69
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:59,566
This is the poison that will
actually end the tumor cell's life.

70
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:03,937
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,

71
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,794
nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.

72
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:08,452
This is our gene blocker.

73
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:12,682
Because siRNA is strongly
negatively charged,

74
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:14,263
we can protect it

75
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:19,012
with a nice, protective layer
of positively charged polymer.

76
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:22,760
The two oppositely charged
molecules stick together

77
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,220
through charge attraction,

78
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,378
and that provides us
with a protective layer

79
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:29,453
that prevents the siRNA
from degrading in the bloodstream.

80
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,406
We're almost done.

81
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,890
(Laughter)

82
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:36,992
But there is one more big obstacle
we have to think about.

83
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,408
In fact, it may be the biggest
obstacle of all.

84
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,406
How do we deploy this superweapon?

85
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,984
I mean, every good weapon
needs to be targeted,

86
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:48,073
we have to target this superweapon
to the supervillain cells

87
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,047
that reside in the tumor.

88
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,344
But our bodies have a natural
immune-defense system:

89
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,867
cells that reside in the bloodstream

90
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:58,236
and pick out things that don't belong,

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,559
so that it can destroy or eliminate them.

92
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:05,019
And guess what? Our nanoparticle
is considered a foreign object.

93
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:09,817
We have to sneak our nanoparticle
past the tumor defense system.

94
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:16,095
We have to get it past this mechanism
of getting rid of the foreign object

95
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,539
by disguising it.

96
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:21,908
So we add one more
negatively charged layer

97
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:23,256
around this nanoparticle,

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,718
which serves two purposes.

99
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,108
First, this outer layer is one
of the naturally charged,

100
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,845
highly hydrated polysaccharides
that resides in our body.

101
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:38,289
It creates a cloud of water molecules
around the nanoparticle

102
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:41,384
that gives us an invisibility
cloaking effect.

103
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,974
This invisibility cloak allows
the nanoparticle

104
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:46,604
to travel through the bloodstream

105
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,393
long and far enough to reach the tumor,

106
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,556
without getting eliminated by the body.

107
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:56,513
Second, this layer contains molecules

108
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:59,736
which bind specifically to our tumor cell.

109
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,710
Once bound, the cancer cell
takes up the nanoparticle,

110
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:09,108
and now we have our nanoparticle
inside the cancer cell

111
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,805
and ready to deploy.

112
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,541
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!

113
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:19,747
(Applause)

114
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:23,283
The siRNA is deployed first.

115
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,913
It acts for hours,

116
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:30,505
giving enough time to silence
and block those survival genes.

117
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:35,336
We have now disabled
those genetic superpowers.

118
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:38,954
What remains is a cancer cell
with no special defenses.

119
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:41,880
Then, the chemotherapy drug
comes out of the core

120
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:45,488
and destroys the tumor cell
cleanly and efficiently.

121
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:48,565
With sufficient gene blockers,

122
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:51,799
we can address many
different kinds of mutations,

123
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,184
allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,

124
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,399
without leaving behind any bad guys.

125
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,527
So, how does our strategy work?

126
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:05,504
We've tested these nanostructure
particles in animals

127
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,111
using a highly aggressive form
of triple-negative breast cancer.

128
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,690
This triple-negative breast cancer
exhibits the gene

129
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:15,189
that spits out cancer drug
as soon as it is delivered.

130
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:20,913
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call
it "dox" -- is the cancer drug

131
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,746
that is the first line of treatment
for breast cancer.

132
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:29,948
So, we first treated our animals
with a dox core, dox only.

133
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:32,868
The tumor slowed their rate of growth,

134
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:34,332
but they still grew rapidly,

135
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:36,684
doubling in size
over a period of two weeks.

136
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:40,395
Then, we tried
our combination superweapon.

137
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:45,827
A nanolayer particle with siRNA
against the chemo pump,

138
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,846
plus, we have the dox in the core.

139
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,185
And look -- we found that not only
did the tumors stop growing,

140
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,725
they actually decreased in size

141
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:58,164
and were eliminated in some cases.

142
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,444
The tumors were actually regressing.

143
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:08,841
(Applause)

144
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,628
What's great about this approach
is that it can be personalized.

145
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,488
We can add many different layers of siRNA

146
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:20,070
to address different mutations
and tumor defense mechanisms.

147
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:23,379
And we can put different drugs
into the nanoparticle core.

148
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:27,153
As doctors learn how to test patients

149
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:30,951
and understand certain
tumor genetic types,

150
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,717
they can help us determine which patients
can benefit from this strategy

151
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:37,019
and which gene blockers we can use.

152
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,313
Ovarian cancer strikes
a special chord with me.

153
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,310
It is a very aggressive cancer,

154
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:46,219
in part because it's discovered
at very late stages,

155
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,690
when it's highly advanced

156
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,990
and there are a number
of genetic mutations.

157
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,555
After the first round of chemotherapy,

158
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,969
this cancer comes back
for 75 percent of patients.

159
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,159
And it usually comes back
in a drug-resistant form.

160
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,909
High-grade ovarian cancer

161
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,100
is one of the biggest
supervillains out there.

162
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,036
And we're now directing our superweapon

163
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,376
toward its defeat.

164
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,637
As a researcher,

165
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,516
I usually don't get to work with patients.

166
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,581
But I recently met a mother

167
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:23,502
who is an ovarian cancer survivor,
Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.

168
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:28,361
I was deeply inspired
by the optimism and strength

169
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,478
that both mother and daughter displayed

170
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:34,187
and by their story of courage and support.

171
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,522
At this event, we spoke
about the different technologies

172
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:39,925
directed at cancer.

173
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,664
And Mimi was in tears

174
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,515
as she explained how learning
about these efforts

175
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,749
gives her hope for future generations,

176
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:48,658
including her own daughter.

177
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:50,863
This really touched me.

178
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,703
It's not just about building
really elegant science.

179
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,239
It's about changing people's lives.

180
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,541
It's about understanding
the power of engineering

181
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,446
on the scale of molecules.

182
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,553
I know that as students like Paige
move forward in their careers,

183
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,017
they'll open new possibilities

184
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,431
in addressing some of the big
health problems in the world --

185
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:17,454
including ovarian cancer, neurological
disorders, infectious disease --

186
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:22,045
just as chemical engineering has
found a way to open doors for me,

187
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:25,071
and has provided a way of engineering

188
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:28,627
on the tiniest scale,
that of molecules,

189
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,214
to heal on the human scale.

190
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,955
Thank you.

191
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:41,539
(Applause)
