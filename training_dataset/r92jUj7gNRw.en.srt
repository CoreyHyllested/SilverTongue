0
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,852
I am so excited to be here.

1
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:18,680
Everything in America
is so much bigger than in Europe.

2
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,676
Look at me -- I am huge!

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,361
(Laughter)

4
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,535
It's fantastic!

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,839
And TED Talks -- TED Talks
are where everybody has great ideas.

6
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:30,260
So the question is: Where do
those great ideas come from?

7
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:32,630
Well, it's a little bit of debate,

8
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,192
but it's generally reckoned
that the average person --

9
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,374
that's me --

10
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:38,932
has about 50,000 thoughts a day.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,114
Which is a lot,

12
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:42,964
until you realize that 95 percent of them

13
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:45,615
are the same ones you had the day before.

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,842
(Laughter)

15
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,255
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,484
I think things like,

17
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:55,593
"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.

18
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,349
Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."

19
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:58,655
My most popular:

20
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,585
"Don't eat that cookie."

21
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,167
(Laughter)

22
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,928
So, 95 percent repetition.

23
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,884
That leaves us with just a five percent
window of opportunity each day

24
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:13,857
to actually think something new.

25
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:16,673
And some of my new thoughts are useless.

26
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:19,326
The other day I was watching
some sports on television,

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,076
and I was trying to decide
why I just don't engage with it.

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,363
Some of it I find curious.

29
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:25,642
This is odd.

30
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:27,816
(Laughter)

31
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:30,765
Do you think it would be
worth being that flexible

32
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,041
just to be able to see
your heel at that angle?

33
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,935
(Laughter)

34
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,969
And here's the thing:

35
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:41,139
I'm never going to be able
to relate to that,

36
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,443
because I'm never going
to be able to do it, OK?

37
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:45,285
Well, not twice, anyway.

38
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:46,937
(Laughter)

39
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,467
But I'll tell you the truth.

40
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:53,294
The truth is I have never been
any good at sport, OK?

41
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:55,995
I've reached that wonderful age
when all my friends say,

42
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:59,221
"Oh, I wish I was as fit
as I was when I was 18."

43
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,386
And I always feel rather smug then.

44
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,647
(Laughter)

45
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,270
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --

46
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,619
(Laughter)

47
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,135
(Applause)

48
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,029
I couldn't run then. I'm certainly
not going to do it now.

49
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,076
(Laughter)

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,657
So then I had my new idea:

51
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,759
Why not engage people like me in sport?

52
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,551
I think what the world needs now

53
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:26,497
is the Olympics for people
with zero athletic ability.

54
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,433
(Laughter)

55
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,404
Oh, it would be so much more fun.

56
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:32,038
We'd have three basic rules, OK?

57
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:35,139
Obviously no drugs;
no corruption, no skills.

58
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:36,203
(Laughter)

59
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,380
It would be --

60
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,862
No, it's a terrible idea.

61
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:44,038
And I also know why I don't engage
with sport when I watch it on television.

62
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:48,649
It's because probably 97 percent of it
is about men running

63
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,199
and men kicking things,

64
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:53,117
men trying to look
neatly packaged in Lycra.

65
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,300
There is --

66
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,822
(Laughter)

67
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,584
Not always successfully.

68
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:58,760
There is --

69
00:02:58,784 --> 00:02:59,816
(Laughter)

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,073
There is so little
female sport on television,

71
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,978
that a young woman watching
might be forgiven for thinking,

72
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:08,559
and how can I put this nicely,

73
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,180
that the male member
is the very lever you need

74
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,809
to get yourself off the couch
and onto a sports ground.

75
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,762
(Laughter)

76
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:21,806
The inequalities in sport
are breathtaking.

77
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,267
So this is what happens to me:

78
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,451
I have a brand new idea,

79
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:27,193
and immediately I come back to an old one.

80
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,305
The fact is, there is not now,

81
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,752
nor has there ever been
in the whole of history,

82
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:38,642
a single country in the world
where women have equality with men.

83
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,836
Not one.

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,547
196 countries,

85
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,877
it hasn't happened
in the whole of evolution.

86
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,871
So, here is a picture of evolution.

87
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:48,410
(Laughter)

88
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,825
We women are not even in it!

89
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,585
(Laughter)

90
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:02,658
It's a wonder men have been able
to evolve quite so brilliantly.

91
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:03,840
So --

92
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:04,873
(Laughter)

93
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:08,623
It bugs me, and I know
I should do something about it.

94
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,235
But I'm busy, OK?

95
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,431
I have a full-on career,

96
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,595
I've got three kids,
I've got an elderly mom.

97
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,186
In fact, if I'm honest with you,

98
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,853
one of the reasons I came out here

99
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,727
is because TED Talks said
I could have 15 minutes to myself,

100
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,492
and I never have that much time --

101
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,885
(Laughter)

102
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,436
(Applause)

103
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,616
So I'm busy.

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,177
And anyway, I already had a go
at changing the world.

105
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,359
Here's the thing, OK?

106
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,539
Everybody has inside themselves
what I call an "activation button."

107
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,949
It's the button that gets
pressed when you think,

108
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:41,777
"I must do something about this."

109
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,023
It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.

110
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,953
Maybe you face some kind of inequality,

111
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:48,253
or you've come across
an injustice of some kind,

112
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:49,818
sometimes an illness strikes,

113
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:52,236
or you're born in some way disadvantaged,

114
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,077
or perhaps underprivileged.

115
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,006
So I was born gay, OK?

116
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,290
I've always known,

117
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,352
I don't think my family
were the least bit surprised.

118
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,594
Here is a picture of me aged four.

119
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,401
I look cute,

120
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:08,576
but inside I genuinely believed
that I looked like Clint Eastwood.

121
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,929
(Laughter)

122
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:18,865
So my activation button
was pressed when I had my kids --

123
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,895
three wonderful kids,
born to my then-partner.

124
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,450
Now here's the thing:
I work on television in Britain.

125
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,415
By the time they were born,
I was already hosting my own shows

126
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,871
and working in the public eye.

127
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,046
I love what I do,

128
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,233
but I love my kids more.

129
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:36,951
And I didn't want them
to grow up with a secret.

130
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:40,460
1994, when my son, my youngest was born,

131
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,556
there was not, as far as I was aware,

132
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,138
a single out, gay woman
in British public life.

133
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,526
I don't think secrets are a good thing.

134
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,493
I think they are a cancer of the soul.

135
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,669
So I decided to come out.

136
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:56,482
Everybody warned me
that I would never work again,

137
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,062
but I decided it was
absolutely worth the risk.

138
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,944
Well, it was hell.

139
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:07,164
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
section of the right-wing press,

140
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,751
and they went nuts.

141
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:13,206
And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,

142
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,860
and we got death threats --

143
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,794
enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,

144
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:20,428
and we had to have police protection.

145
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:25,120
And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night

146
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:28,398
when I was terrified by what I had done.

147
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,457
Eventually the dust settled.

148
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,808
Against all expectation
I carried on working,

149
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:36,500
and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.

150
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:39,437
I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.

151
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,054
They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.

152
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:44,911
The friend said to my son,
"What's it like having two mums?"

153
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:48,229
I was a little anxious to hear,
so I leant in to hear and my son said,

154
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,475
"It's fantastic,
because if one of them's sick,

155
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,663
you've still got another one
to cook for you."

156
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:55,264
(Laughter)

157
00:06:57,422 --> 00:07:01,218
So my activation button
for gay equality was pressed,

158
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:03,446
and along with many, many others,

159
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,891
I campaigned for years for gay rights,

160
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:09,082
and in particular, the right to marry
the person that I love.

161
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,186
In the end, we succeeded.

162
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,826
And in 2014, on the day
that the law was changed,

163
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,996
I married my wife,
who I love very much, indeed.

164
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,742
(Applause)

165
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,924
We didn't do it in a quiet way --
we did it on the stage

166
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,805
at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

167
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,367
It was a great event.

168
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,543
The hall seats two-and-a-half
thousand people.

169
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:34,140
We invited 150 family and friends,
then I let it be known to the public:

170
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,377
anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,
please come and join us.

171
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,626
It would be free to anybody
who wanted to come.

172
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,772
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.

173
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,017
(Applause)

174
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:47,996
Every kind of person you can imagine:

175
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,620
gays, straights, rabbis,
nuns, married people,

176
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,199
black, white -- the whole
of humanity was there.

177
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,897
And I remember standing
on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.

178
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,556
Job done.

179
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,943
Love triumphs.

180
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,379
Law changed."

181
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:02,561
And I --

182
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:05,304
(Applause)

183
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,648
And I genuinely thought
my activation days were over, OK?

184
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,085
So every year in that same hall,

185
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:15,781
I host a fantastic concert to celebrate
International Women's Day.

186
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,979
We gather the world's only
all-female orchestra,

187
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:22,792
we play fantastic music by forgotten
or overlooked women composers,

188
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,228
we have amazing conductors --

189
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,546
it's Marin Alsop there
from Baltimore conducting,

190
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,732
Petula Clark singing --

191
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:30,436
and I give a lecture on women's history.

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,845
I love to gather inspirational stories
from the past and pass them on.

193
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:38,693
Too often, I think history's what I call
the Mount Rushmore model.

194
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:43,104
It looks majestic, but the women
have been entirely left out of it.

195
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:47,094
And I was giving a talk in 2015
about the suffragettes --

196
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:50,773
I'm sure you know those magnificent
women who fought so hard

197
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,907
for the right for women
in Britain to vote.

198
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,266
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."

199
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,540
And boy, they succeeded,

200
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:01,444
because women did indeed
get the vote in 1928.

201
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,222
So I'm giving this talk about this,

202
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:05,842
and as I'm talking, what I realized is:

203
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:08,178
this was not a history
lecture I was giving;

204
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,694
this was not something
where the job was done.

205
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:14,346
This was something where
there was so much left to do.

206
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,326
Nowhere in the world, for example,

207
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,267
do women have equal representation
in positions of power.

208
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,529
OK, let's take a very quick look
at the top 100 companies

209
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,220
in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.

210
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,738
Top 100 companies:
How many women running them?

211
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:32,627
Seven. OK. Seven.
That's all right, I suppose.

212
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:37,412
Until you realize that 17
are run by men called "John."

213
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:41,633
(Laughter)

214
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:53,245
There are more men called John
running FTSE 100 companies --

215
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,159
(Laughter)

216
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:56,718
than there are women.

217
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,470
There are 14 run by men called "Dave."

218
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,938
(Laughter)

219
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,676
Now, I'm sure Dave and John
are doing a bang-up job.

220
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,988
(Laughter)

221
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,862
OK. Why does it matter?

222
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:13,185
Well, it's that pesky business
of the gender pay gap.

223
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,122
Nowhere in the world
do women earn the same as men.

224
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,078
And that is never going to change

225
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,725
unless we have more women
at the top in the boardroom.

226
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,135
We have plenty of laws;

227
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,212
the Equal Pay Act in Britain
was passed in 1975.

228
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:31,120
Nevertheless, there are still
many, many women

229
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,181
who, from early November
until the end of the year,

230
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:36,392
by comparison to their male colleagues,

231
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,188
are effectively working for free.

232
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,088
In fact, the World Economic
Forum estimates

233
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,555
that women will finally
get equal pay in ...

234
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,738
2133!

235
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,553
Yay!

236
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:52,213
(Laughter)

237
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,648
That's a terrible figure.

238
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,892
And here's the thing:

239
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,008
the day before I came out to give my talk,

240
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,784
the World Economic Forum revised it.

241
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,168
So that's good, because
that's a terrible -- 2133.

242
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,917
Do you know what they revised it to?

243
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,131
2186.

244
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:08,698
(Laughter)

245
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,843
Yeah, another 53 years, OK?

246
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,720
We are not going to get equal pay

247
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:17,897
in my grandchildren's
grandchildren's lives

248
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,303
under the current system.

249
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:22,184
And I have waited long enough.

250
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,272
I've waited long enough
in my own business.

251
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:28,310
In 2016 I became the very
first woman on British television

252
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,946
to host a prime-time panel show.

253
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,006
Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.

254
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,181
But --

255
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,498
(Applause)

256
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,849
But 2016! The first!

257
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,835
Television's been around for 80 years!

258
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:41,871
(Laughter)

259
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,843
It may be television's not so important,

260
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,810
but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?

261
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:49,837
2016, the UN were looking
for a brand new ambassador

262
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,652
to represent women's empowerment
and gender equality,

263
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,152
and who did they choose?

264
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,287
Wonder Woman.

265
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,622
Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?

266
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:00,847
(Laughter)

267
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,719
Because no woman was up to the job.

268
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:10,282
The representation of women
in positions of power is shockingly low.

269
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:13,783
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
true in the British Parliament.

270
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:18,198
In 2015, the number of men
elected to the Parliament that year

271
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:21,103
was greater than the total number of women

272
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:24,207
who have ever been members of Parliament.

273
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:25,390
And why does it matter?

274
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,677
Here's the thing:
if they're not at the table --

275
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,797
literally, in Britain, at that table
helping to make the laws --

276
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:35,344
do not be surprised if the female
perspective is overlooked.

277
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,748
It's a great role model for young people
to see a woman in charge.

278
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:41,861
In 2016, Britain got its second
female Prime Minister;

279
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,524
Theresa May came to power.

280
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:45,752
The day she came to power
she was challenged:

281
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:46,970
just do one thing.

282
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,982
Do one thing in the first
100 days that you're in office

283
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,947
to try and improve
lives for women in Britain.

284
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,968
And what did she do? Nothing.

285
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,293
Nothing.

286
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,882
Because she's much too busy
cleaning up the mess the boys made.

287
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,365
Even having a female leader,

288
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,383
they always find something better to do

289
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,694
than to sort out the pesky
issue of inequality.

290
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:11,560
So I keep talking about equality
like it matters. Does it?

291
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,881
Well, let's take a very quick look
at the STEM industries, OK?

292
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:17,472
So science, technology,
engineering and mathematics.

293
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:22,113
Pretty much important in every
single aspect of our daily lives.

294
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:28,441
There is the thickest and most incredibly
well-documented glass ceiling

295
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,015
in the STEM industries.

296
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:32,488
What if the cure for cancer

297
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,113
or the answer the global warming

298
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:39,082
lies in the head of a young female
scientist who fails to progress?

299
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,553
So I thought all these things,

300
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:47,503
and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."

301
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,939
And I spoke to my wonderful friend,

302
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,690
brilliant journalist
Catherine Mayer in Britain,

303
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:54,164
and we rather foolishly --

304
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,390
and I suspect there was wine involved --

305
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:59,168
(Laughter)

306
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:02,837
We decided to found
a brand new political party.

307
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,487
Because here's the critical thing:

308
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:09,409
the one place women and men
are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.

309
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,425
We had no idea what we were doing,

310
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,547
we didn't know how complicated
it was to start a political party.

311
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:18,106
I thought, "It can't be that difficult,
men have been doing it for years."

312
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,287
(Laughter)

313
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:25,597
So we started by calling it
"The Women's Equality Party."

314
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:27,844
And straightaway people said to me,

315
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,322
"Why did you call it that?"

316
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,922
I said, "I don't know,
I just thought we'd be clear."

317
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,462
(Laughter)

318
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,307
I didn't want what we were doing
to be a secret, you know? I just --

319
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,624
(Laughter)

320
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,874
Some people said, "You can't call it that!
It's much too feminist!"

321
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:49,726
Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!

322
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,256
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard somebody say,

323
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,454
"I'm not a feminist, but ..."

324
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,440
And I always think
if there's a "but" in the sentence,

325
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,233
it can't all be roses in the garden.

326
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,261
And then I started getting asked
the hilarious question,

327
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,199
"Are you all going to burn your bras?"

328
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,581
Yes! Because bras are famously
made of flammable material.

329
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,359
(Laughter)

330
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,850
That's why all women spark when they walk.

331
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:16,603
(Laughter)

332
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:23,038
Here's quick history sidebar for you:

333
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:25,597
no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.

334
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,443
It's a story made up by a journalist.

335
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,092
Thank goodness journalism
has improved since then.

336
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,271
So --

337
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,653
(Laughter)

338
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,936
I announced what we were going
to do in a broadcast interview,

339
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,062
and straightaway,
the emails started coming.

340
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,329
First hundreds,
then thousands and thousands,

341
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:44,153
from every age group: from the very young
to women in their '90s,

342
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,559
to hundreds of wonderful men.

343
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,595
People wrote and said,
"Please, can I help?

344
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,835
Please, can I visit you
at party headquarters?"

345
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,527
We didn't have a headquarters --
we didn't have a party!

346
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,749
We didn't have anything.

347
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:57,672
All we had was a wonderful,
tight group of fabulous friends

348
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:02,381
trying to answer emails
pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.

349
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:04,242
We were all busy.

350
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,552
Many of us had careers,
many of us had children,

351
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:09,311
but we did what women do,
and we shared the work.

352
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,773
And almost instantly, we agreed
on certain fundamental things.

353
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:16,289
First thing: we want to be
the only political party in the world

354
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,018
whose main aim was
to no longer need to exist.

355
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,847
That's a fantastic idea.

356
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:24,701
We wanted to be the only political party
with no particular political leaning.

357
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,822
We wanted people from the left,
from the right, from the middle,

358
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:28,998
every age group.

359
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,837
Because the whole point
was to work with a simple agenda:

360
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:35,080
let's get equality
in every aspect of our lives,

361
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:36,260
and when we're finished,

362
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,519
let's go home and get
the other chores done.

363
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:39,625
(Laughter)

364
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,056
And we wanted to change
how politics is conducted.

365
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,563
I don't know if you have this,

366
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,024
but in Britain we have
two major political parties.

367
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,696
They're the dinosaurs of politics.

368
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,258
And how they speak to each other
is shameful and poisonous.

369
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:54,353
I'm sure you've never had
that kind of name-calling --

370
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:55,722
(Laughter)

371
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:58,163
And lying here.

372
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,436
Wouldn't it be great
if just one politician said,

373
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,355
"Do you know, my opponent has a point.

374
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,778
Let's see if we can't work together
and get the job done."

375
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:11,319
(Applause)

376
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,576
And let's get more women
into politics, OK?

377
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,774
Let's immediately get
more women into politics

378
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:21,484
by being the only political party
to offer free childcare to our candidates,

379
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,181
so they can get out of the house
and start campaigning.

380
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,461
(Applause)

381
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:30,022
Within 10 months,

382
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:33,994
we had more than 70 branches
of our party across the UK.

383
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:37,177
We stood candidates for election
in London, Scotland and Wales

384
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:38,765
in May 2016.

385
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,334
One in 20 people voted
for our candidate for London Mayor.

386
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:47,551
And when the men in the race
saw how many votes we were attracting,

387
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:48,749
wonder of wonders,

388
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:53,103
they began to talk about the need
to tackle gender equality.

389
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:56,187
(Applause)

390
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:02,236
You know, I've been promised
change since I was a child.

391
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,317
It was always coming:

392
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,039
women were going to stand
shoulder to shoulder with men.

393
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,546
All I got were empty promises
and disappointment --

394
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,940
enough disappointment
to found a political party.

395
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:15,070
But here is my new idea for today --
this is my five percent, OK?

396
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,693
And this one is really good.

397
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,463
The fact is, this is not enough.

398
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:24,549
It is not enough to found one political
party for equality in a single country.

399
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:29,120
What we need is a seismic change
in the global political landscape.

400
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,838
And the wonderful thing
about the model we have created

401
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,737
is that it would work anywhere.

402
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,421
It would work in America,

403
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,839
it would work in Australia,
it would work in India.

404
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,770
It's like we've made the perfect recipe:
anybody can cook it,

405
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,190
and it's good for everybody.

406
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:43,837
And we want to give it away.

407
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,579
If you want to know what we did,
we're giving it away.

408
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:52,217
Can you imagine if we could mobilize
millions of women across the world

409
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:55,559
to say, "That's enough!"
to the traditional battles of politics?

410
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,617
To say, "Stop the bickering,
let's get the work done."

411
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:01,948
We could literally change the world.

412
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,389
And I want that.

413
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,825
(Applause)

414
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,080
I want ...

415
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:11,555
(Applause)

416
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,514
I want that for our daughters,

417
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,041
and I want it for our sons.

418
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:20,457
Because the fact is:
equality is better for everyone.

419
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:23,412
Come on people, let's activate!
Let's change the world!

420
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:26,292
I know we can do it, and it wants doing!

421
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:30,815
(Applause)
