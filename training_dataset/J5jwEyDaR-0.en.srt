0
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:21,740
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007.

1
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:26,036
We made this kindergarten
to be a circle.

2
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:29,178
It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof.

3
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,699
If you are a parent,

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,663
you know that kids love
to keep making circles.

5
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:39,600
This is how the rooftop looks.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,858
And why did we design this?

7
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:44,675
The principal of this kindergarten said,

8
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,254
"No, I don't want a handrail."

9
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,483
I said, "It's impossible."

10
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:55,777
But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof?

11
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,986
So that it can catch
the children falling off?"

12
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,433
(Laughter)

13
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,509
I said, "It's impossible."

14
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,889
And of course,
the government official said,

15
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:08,154
"Of course you have to have a handrail."

16
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:13,843
But we could keep
that idea around the trees.

17
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:17,120
There are three trees popping through.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,745
And we were allowed to call
this rope as a handrail.

19
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:26,017
But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them.

20
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:28,503
They fall into the net.

21
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:32,355
And you get more,

22
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:35,292
and more,

23
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,502
more.

24
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:37,653
(Laughter)

25
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:41,203
Sometimes 40 children
are around a tree.

26
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:44,981
The boy on the branch,

27
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,464
he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree.

28
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,964
(Laughter)

29
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,785
And at the time of an event,

30
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:55,051
they sit on the edge.

31
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,563
It looks so nice from underneath.

32
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,652
Monkeys in the zoo.

33
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,552
(Laughter)

34
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:06,318
Feeding time.

35
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:10,949
(Laughter)
(Applause)

36
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,313
And we made the roof as low as possible,

37
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:19,757
because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof,

38
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:22,438
not only underneath the roof.

39
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:26,299
And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling.

40
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,215
And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps.

41
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:34,434
You see with the flexible tubes,

42
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,329
you want to spray water
to your friends,

43
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,044
and the shower,

44
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:41,541
and the one in front is quite normal.

45
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,087
But if you look at this,

46
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,917
the boy is not washing his boots,

47
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,591
he's putting water into his boots.

48
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,531
(Laughter)

49
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:58,499
This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year.

50
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,339
And there is no boundary
between inside and outside.

51
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:07,978
So it means basically
this architecture is a roof.

52
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,267
And also there is no boundary
between classrooms.

53
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,861
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,415
When you put many children in a quiet box,

55
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:24,733
some of them get really nervous.

56
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,985
But in this kindergarten,

57
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:30,415
there is no reason they get nervous.

58
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,225
Because there is no boundary.

59
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,422
And the principal says

60
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:39,425
if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room,

61
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,120
we let him go.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,279
He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back.

63
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,241
(Laughter)

64
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,556
But the point is,
in that kind of occasion,

65
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:54,407
usually children try to hide somewhere.

66
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:58,986
But here, just they leave and come back.

67
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,836
It's a natural process.

68
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:05,859
And secondly, we consider
noise very important.

69
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:14,142
You know that children
sleep better in noise.

70
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:17,986
They don't sleep in a quiet space.

71
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,236
And in this kindergarten,

72
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:25,483
these children show
amazing concentration in class.

73
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:33,660
And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise.

74
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,663
They need noise.

75
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:39,967
And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar.

76
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,928
You are not supposed to be in silence.

77
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,095
And you know, these days

78
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:50,569
we are trying to make
everything under control.

79
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,021
You know, it's completely open.

80
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:57,033
And you should know that

81
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:02,818
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.

82
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:05,922
In summer you go swimming.

83
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,766
The sand is 50 degrees.

84
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:12,029
And also, you should know
that you are waterproof.

85
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,181
You never melt in rain.

86
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,050
So, children are supposed to be outside.

87
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,251
So that is how we should treat them.

88
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:24,923
This is how they divide classrooms.

89
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,426
They are supposed to help teachers.

90
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,731
They don't.

91
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:31,346
(Laughter)

92
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,382
I didn't put him in.

93
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,706
A classroom.

94
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:44,105
And a washbasin.

95
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:47,932
They talk to each other around the well.

96
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,819
And there are always
some trees in the classroom.

97
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,377
A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above.

98
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,225
(Laughter)

99
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,829
Monkeys.

100
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,283
(Laughter)

101
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:08,698
And each classroom has
at least one skylight.

102
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,465
And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas.

103
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,682
This is the annex building,

104
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:26,151
right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten.

105
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:31,810
The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors.

106
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,971
And of course,
the ceiling height is very low.

107
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:38,036
So you have to consider safety.

108
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:42,417
So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son.

109
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,241
They tried to go in.

110
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:50,353
He hit his head.

111
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:55,312
He's okay. His skull is quite strong.

112
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:58,400
He is resilient. It's my son.

113
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,068
(Laughter)

114
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,898
And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off.

115
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,705
And then we put other children.

116
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,376
The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know.

117
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,528
(Laughter)

118
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:21,379
The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive.

119
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,910
Now these days,

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,530
kids need a small dosage of danger.

121
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,375
And in this kind of occasion,

122
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,300
they learn to help each other.

123
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,735
This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days.

124
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:54,976
Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy

125
00:07:54,976 --> 00:08:01,300
between 9:10 and 9:30.

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,501
And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters.

127
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:11,353
So it's not exactly small at all.

128
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:15,959
And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning.

129
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,551
But the surprise is yet to come.

130
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:26,248
The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average.

131
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:34,435
And these children have
the highest athletic abilities

132
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:37,590
among many kindergartens.

133
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,016
The principal says,

134
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:50,743
"I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof.

135
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,972
Just like sheep."

136
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:54,401
(Laughter)

137
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,230
They keep running.

138
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,259
(Laughter)

139
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:03,838
My point is don't control them,

140
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:07,060
don't protect them too much,

141
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,687
and they need to tumble sometimes.

142
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:14,473
They need to get some injury.

143
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:17,892
And that makes them learn

144
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,028
how to live in this world.

145
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:31,057
I think architecture is capable
of changing this world,

146
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:32,899
and people's lives.

147
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:39,991
And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children.

148
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,133
Thank you very much.

149
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:44,152
(Applause)
