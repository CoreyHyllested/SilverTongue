00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:16,389
In the great 1980s movie
"The Blues Brothers,"

1
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:21,183
there's a scene where John Belushi
goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment

2
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,506
in Chicago for the very first time.

3
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:26,637
It's a cramped, tiny space

4
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:29,168
and it's just three feet away
from the train tracks.

5
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:32,466
As John sits on Dan's bed,

6
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,929
a train goes rushing by,

7
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,153
rattling everything in the room.

8
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:40,982
John asks, "How often does
that train go by?"

9
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:45,542
Dan replies, "So often, you won't
even notice it."

10
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,448
And then, something falls off the wall.

11
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,042
We all know what he's talking about.

12
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:53,883
As human beings, we get used
to everyday things

13
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,080
really fast.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,984
As a product designer,
it's my job to see those everyday things,

15
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:02,521
to feel them, and try
to improve upon them.

16
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,861
For example, see this piece of fruit?

17
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,811
See this little sticker?

18
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,666
That sticker wasn't there
when I was a kid.

19
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,694
But somewhere as the years passed,

20
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:19,575
someone had the bright idea
to put that sticker on the fruit.

21
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:20,292
Why?

22
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,821
So it could be easier for us

23
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,558
to check out
at the grocery counter.

24
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:24,651
Well that's great,

25
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,706
we can get in and out of
the store quickly.

26
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,784
But now, there's a new problem.

27
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:31,443
When we get home and we're hungry

28
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:34,874
and we see this ripe, juicy piece
of fruit on the counter,

29
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,719
we just want to pick it up
and eat it.

30
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,455
Except now, we have to look
for this little sticker.

31
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:46,961
And dig at it with our nails,
damaging the flesh.

32
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,601
Then rolling up that sticker --

33
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,636
you know what I mean.

34
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:51,775
And then trying to flick
it off your fingers.

35
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:55,136
(Applause)

36
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:57,776
It's not fun,

37
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:58,797
not at all.

38
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,682
But something interesting happened.

39
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:05,073
See the first time you did it,
you probably felt those feelings.

40
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,280
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,287
You felt upset.

42
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,021
You just wanted to dive in.

43
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,165
By the 10th time,

44
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,641
you started to become less upset

45
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,071
and you just started peeling
the label off.

46
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,480
By the 100th time,
at least for me,

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,612
I became numb to it.

48
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,103
I simply picked up the piece of fruit,

49
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,215
dug at it with my nails,
tried to flick it off,

50
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,771
and then wondered,

51
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,270
"Was there another sticker?"

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,974
So why is that?

53
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,126
Why do we get used to everyday things?

54
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,274
Well as human beings,
we have limited brain power.

55
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:47,043
And so our brains encode the
everyday things we do into habits

56
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,620
so we can free up space
to learn new things.

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,662
It's a process called habituation

58
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:56,266
and it's one of the most basic ways,
as humans, we learn.

59
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,765
Now, habituation isn't always bad.

60
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,611
Remember learning to drive?

61
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,279
I sure do.

62
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,227
Your hands clenched at 10 and 2
on the wheel,

63
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:10,445
looking at every single
object out there --

64
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:13,695
the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.

65
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,006
It's a nerve-wracking experience.

66
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:20,520
So much so, that I couldn't even
talk to anyone else in the car

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,450
and I couldn't even listen to music.

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,949
But then something interesting happened.

69
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,119
As the weeks went by,
driving became easier and easier.

70
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,647
You habituated it.

71
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,914
It started to become
fun and second nature.

72
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:37,531
And then, you could talk
to your friends again

73
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,490
and listen to music.

74
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,189
So there's a good reason why
our brains habituate things.

75
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,552
If we didn't, we'd notice
every little detail,

76
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,167
all the time.

77
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,295
It would be exhausting,

78
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,687
and we'd have no time
to learn about new things.

79
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,457
But sometimes,
habituation isn't good.

80
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:59,812
If it stops us from noticing
the problems that are around us,

81
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:00,843
well, that's bad.

82
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:04,816
And if it stops us from noticing
and fixing those problems,

83
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,933
well, then that's really bad.

84
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,906
Comedians know all about this.

85
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:14,791
Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built
on noticing those little details,

86
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,769
those idiotic things we do every day
that we don't even remember.

87
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,615
He tells us about the time
he visited his friends

88
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:25,001
and he just wanted to take
a comfortable shower.

89
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,898
He'd reach out and grab the handle
and turn it slightly one way,

90
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,483
and it was 100 degrees too hot.

91
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:35,415
And then he'd turn it the other way,
and it was 100 degrees too cold.

92
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,778
He just wanted a comfortable shower.

93
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,941
Now, we've all been there,

94
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,726
we just don't remember it.

95
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,048
But Jerry did,

96
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,062
and that's a comedian's job.

97
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:48,182
But designers, innovators
and entrepreneurs,

98
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:50,589
it's our job to not just notice
those things,

99
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,525
but to go one step further
and try to fix them.

100
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,842
See this, this person,

101
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:58,311
this is Mary Anderson.

102
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,778
In 1902 in New York City,

103
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,606
she was visiting.

104
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:07,834
It was a cold, wet, snowy day
and she was warm inside a streetcar.

105
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,323
As she was going to her destination,
she noticed the driver opening the window

106
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:19,128
to clean off the excess snow
so he could drive safely.

107
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:23,834
When he opened the window, though,
he let all this cold, wet air inside,

108
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,779
making all the passengers miserable.

109
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,122
Now probably, most of those
passengers just thought,

110
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,373
"It's a fact of life, he's got
to open the window to clean it.

111
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:34,766
That's just how it is."

112
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,711
But Mary didn't.

113
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,010
Mary thought,

114
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,844
"What if the diver could actually clean
the windshield from the inside

115
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:45,122
so that he could stay safe and drive

116
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:48,063
and the passengers could
actually stay warm?"

117
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:51,355
So she picked up her sketchbook
right then and there,

118
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:55,716
and began drawing what would become
the world's first windshield wiper.

119
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:01,194
Now as a product designer,
I try to learn from people like Mary

120
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:03,963
to try to see the world
the way it really is,

121
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,047
not the way we think it is.

122
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:07,534
Why?

123
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,881
Because it's easy to solve a problem
that almost everyone sees.

124
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,674
But it's hard to solve a problem
that almost no one sees.

125
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:19,169
Now some people think
you're born with this ability

126
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,750
or you're not,

127
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,693
as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth
to see the world more clearly.

128
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,813
That wasn't the case for me.

129
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,456
I had to work at it.

130
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,395
During my years at Apple,

131
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:39,142
Steve Jobs challenged us
to come into work every day,

132
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:43,056
to see our products through
the eyes of the customer,

133
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:44,503
the new customer,

134
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:47,689
the one that has fears
and possible frustrations

135
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,830
and hopeful exhilaration that their
new technology product

136
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,851
could work straightaway for them.

137
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,705
He called it staying beginners,

138
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:59,687
and wanted to make sure that we
focused on those tiny little details

139
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:03,845
to make them faster, easier and seamless
for the new customers.

140
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,805
So I remember this clearly
in the very earliest days of the iPod.

141
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,698
See, back in the '90s,

142
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,127
being a gadget freak like I am,

143
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:20,002
I would rush out to the store
for the very, very latest gadget.

144
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,353
I'd take all the time to get to the store,

145
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:26,964
I'd check out, I'd come back home,
I'd start to unbox it.

146
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:30,890
And then, there was
another little sticker:

147
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,005
the one that said, "Charge before use."

148
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,553
What!

149
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:36,558
I can't believe it!

150
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:38,734
I just spent all this time
buying this product

151
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,768
and now I have to charge before use.

152
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:45,158
I have to wait what felt like an eternity
to use that coveted new toy.

153
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:46,850
It was crazy.

154
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,755
But you know what?

155
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,838
Almost every product back then did that.

156
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:51,613
When it had batteries in it,

157
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,890
you had to charge it
before you used it.

158
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,136
Well, Steve noticed that

159
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:57,967
and he said,

160
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,565
"We're not going to let that
happen to our product."

161
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,413
So what did we do?

162
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:05,499
Typically, when you have a product
that has a hard drive in it,

163
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:08,162
you run it for about
30 minutes in the factory

164
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:11,311
to make sure that hard drive's going
to be working years later

165
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:14,385
for the customer after they
pull it out of the box.

166
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:17,451
What did we do instead?

167
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,541
We ran that product for over two hours.

168
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,129
Why?

169
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,254
Well, first off, we could make
a higher quality product,

170
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,404
be easy to test,

171
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,346
and make sure it was great
for the customer.

172
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,159
But most importantly,

173
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,178
the battery came fully charged
right out of the box,

174
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:35,124
ready to use.

175
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:38,956
So that customer,
with all that exhilaration,

176
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:40,684
could just start using the product.

177
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:43,074
It was great, and it worked.

178
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,338
People liked it.

179
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:47,445
Today, almost every product
that you get that's battery powered

180
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,508
comes out of the box fully charged,

181
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,561
even if it doesn't have a hard drive.

182
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,905
But back then, we noticed
that detail and we fixed it,

183
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:59,253
and now everyone else does that as well.

184
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,894
No more, "Charge before use."

185
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,701
So why am I telling you this?

186
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,809
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,

187
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:11,320
not just the obvious problem,
that's important,

188
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,160
not just for product design,
but for everything we do.

189
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:18,206
You see, there are invisible problems
all around us,

190
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,462
ones we can solve.

191
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:24,286
But first we need
to see them, to feel them.

192
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,964
So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips

193
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,695
about neuroscience or psychology.

194
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,689
There's far too many experienced people
in the TED community

195
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:36,083
who would know much more
about that than I ever will.

196
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,710
But let me leave you with
a few tips that I do,

197
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,383
that we all can do,
to fight habituation.

198
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:45,777
My first tip is to look broader.

199
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,889
You see, when you're tackling a problem,

200
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,281
sometimes, there are a lot of steps
that lead up to that problem.

201
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:54,351
And sometimes, a lot
of steps after it.

202
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,700
If you can take a step back
and look broader,

203
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,971
maybe you can change some of those boxes

204
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:00,977
before the problem.

205
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,337
Maybe you can combine them.

206
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,672
Maybe you can remove them altogether
to make that better.

207
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,249
Take thermostats, for instance.

208
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,627
In the 1900s when they first came out,
they were really simple to use.

209
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,579
You could turn them up or turn them down.

210
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,279
People understood them.

211
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,772
But in the 1970s,

212
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,846
the energy crisis struck,

213
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:23,416
and customers started thinking about
how to save energy.

214
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,703
So what happened?

215
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,731
Thermostat designers decided
to add a new step.

216
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,581
Instead of just turning up and down,

217
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,572
you now had to program it.

218
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,790
So you could tell it the temperature
you wanted at a certain time.

219
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,586
Now that seemed great.

220
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:40,064
Every thermostat had
started adding that feature.

221
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:44,340
But it turned out that no one
saved any energy.

222
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,853
Now, why is that?

223
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,588
Well, people couldn't predict the future.

224
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:52,136
They just didn't know how their weeks
would change season to season,

225
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,634
year to year.

226
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,745
So no one was saving energy,

227
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:57,727
and what happened?

228
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,350
Thermostat designers went back
to the drawing board

229
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,392
and they focused on that programming step.

230
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,409
They made better U.I.s,

231
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,575
they made better documentation.

232
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:12,305
But still, years later,
people were not saving any energy

233
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,901
because they just couldn't
predict the future.

234
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,909
So what did we do?

235
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,978
We put a machine-learning algorithm in
instead of the programming

236
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,676
that would simply watch
when you turned it up and down,

237
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,270
when you liked a certain temperature
when you got up,

238
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,977
or when you went away.

239
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,245
And you know what?

240
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:30,172
It worked.

241
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,639
People are saving energy
without any programming.

242
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,246
So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.

243
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,512
If you take a step back
and look at all the boxes,

244
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:43,533
maybe there's a way
to remove one or combine them

245
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:46,047
so that you can make
that process much simpler.

246
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,084
So that's my first tip: look broader.

247
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,065
For my second tip, it's to look closer.

248
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:57,096
One of my greatest teachers
was my grandfather.

249
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:00,907
He taught me all about the world.

250
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:05,049
He taught me how things were built
and how they were repaired,

251
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,771
the tools and techniques necessary
to make a successful project.

252
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:14,008
I remember one story
he told me about screws,

253
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:17,678
and about how you need to have
the right screw for the right job.

254
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,617
There are many different screws:

255
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:24,487
wood screws, metal screws,
anchors, concrete screws,

256
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,232
the list went on and on.

257
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:30,485
Our job is to make products
that are easy to install

258
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:34,219
for all of our customs themselves
without professionals.

259
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,210
So what did we do?

260
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,655
I remembered that story
that my grandfather told me,

261
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,928
and so we thought,

262
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,428
"How many different screws
can we put in the box?

263
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,278
Was it going to be two, three,
four, five?

264
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,574
Because there's so many
different wall types."

265
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,304
So we thought about it, we optimized it,

266
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,395
and we came up with three different
screws to put in the box.

267
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,122
We thought that was going
to solve the problem.

268
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,817
But it turned out, it didn't.

269
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,158
So we shipped the product,

270
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,548
and people weren't having
a great experience.

271
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,336
So what did we do?

272
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,081
We went back to the drawing board

273
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,545
just instantly after we figured out
we didn't get it right.

274
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:16,269
And we designed a special screw,
a custom screw,

275
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,440
much to the chagrin of our investors.

276
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,862
They were like, "Why are you spending
so much time on a little screw?

277
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,861
Get out there and sell more!"

278
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:27,184
And we said, "We will sell more
if we get this right."

279
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,594
And it turned out, we did.

280
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:32,888
With that custom little screw,
there was just one screw in the box,

281
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,995
that was easy to mount
and put on the wall.

282
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:43,625
So if we focus on those tiny details,
the ones we may not see

283
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,228
and we look at them as we say,

284
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:47,636
"Are those important

285
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:50,436
or is that the way we've always done it?

286
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:53,320
Maybe there's a way to get rid of those."

287
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,839
So my last piece of advice
is to think younger.

288
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:04,545
Every day, I'm confronted with interesting
questions from my three young kids.

289
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,316
They come up with questions like,

290
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,224
"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"

291
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:13,420
Or, "Why don't my shoelaces
have Velcro instead?"

292
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,389
Sometimes, those questions are smart.

293
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,947
My son came to me the other day
and I asked him,

294
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:23,123
"Go run out to the mailbox
and check it."

295
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:26,891
He looked at me, puzzled, and said,

296
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:32,225
"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself
and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)

297
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:35,878
I was like, "That's a pretty
good question."

298
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,492
So, they can ask tons of questions

299
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:44,210
and sometimes we find out
we just don't have the right answers.

300
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,017
We say, "Son, that's just the way
the world works."

301
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,567
So the more we're exposed to something,

302
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,764
the more we get used to it.

303
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,894
But kids haven't been around
long enough

304
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,794
to get used to those things.

305
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,611
And so when they run into problems,

306
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,834
they immediately try to solve them,

307
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,576
and sometimes they find a better way,

308
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:08,280
and that way really is better.

309
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,119
So my advice that we take to heart
is to have young people on your team,

310
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,225
or people with young minds.

311
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,576
Because if you have those young minds,

312
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:21,736
they cause everyone in the room
to think younger.

313
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:26,100
Picasso once said,
"Every child is an artist.

314
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,406
The problem is when he or she grows up,
is how to remain an artist."

315
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:37,734
We all saw the world more clearly
when we saw it for the first time,

316
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,308
before a lifetime of habits
got in the way.

317
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,341
Our challenge is to get back there,

318
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,586
to feel that frustration,

319
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:47,926
to see those little details,

320
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,666
to look broader,

321
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,422
look closer,

322
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,092
and to think younger

323
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,710
so we can stay beginners.

324
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,373
It's not easy.

325
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,908
It requires us pushing back

326
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:02,109
against one of the most basic ways
we make sense of the world.

327
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:04,732
But if we do,

328
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,243
we could do some pretty amazing things.

329
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:09,890
For me, hopefully, that's better
product design.

330
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,517
For you, that could mean something else,
something powerful.

331
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:21,169
Our challenge is to wake up
each day and say,

332
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:24,344
"How can I experience the world better?"

333
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:29,193
And if we do, maybe, just maybe,

334
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:33,388
we can get rid of these
dumb little stickers.

335
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:35,797
Thank you very much.

336
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,274
(Applause)
