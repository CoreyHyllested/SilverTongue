0
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,023
For the last 50 years,

1
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:20,638
a lot of smart, well-resourced people --
some of you, no doubt --

2
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:23,964
have been trying to figure out
how to reduce poverty

3
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:25,207
in the United States.

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,144
People have created and invested
millions of dollars

5
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,385
into non-profit organizations

6
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,599
with the mission of helping
people who are poor.

7
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,135
They've created think tanks

8
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,413
that study issues like education,
job creation and asset-building,

9
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:48,212
and then advocated for policies to support
our most marginalized communities.

10
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:52,370
They've written books and columns
and given passionate speeches,

11
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:56,165
decrying the wealth gap
that is leaving more and more people

12
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,289
entrenched at the bottom end
of the income scale.

13
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,645
And that effort has helped.

14
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:03,573
But it's not enough.

15
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:07,834
Our poverty rates haven't changed
that much in the last 50 years,

16
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,961
since the War on Poverty was launched.

17
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:12,727
I'm here to tell you

18
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:18,178
that we have overlooked
the most powerful and practical resource.

19
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,485
Here it is:

20
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,202
people who are poor.

21
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:27,394
Up in the left-hand corner
is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.

22
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,934
They met when they all had small children,

23
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,795
through a parenting class
at a family resource center

24
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,003
in San Francisco.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,419
As they grew together
as parents and friends,

26
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,459
they talked a lot about how hard it was

27
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,705
to make money when your kids are little.

28
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,411
Child care is expensive,

29
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:46,190
more than they'd earn in a job.

30
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:47,374
Their husbands worked,

31
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,874
but they wanted to contribute
financially, too.

32
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,637
So they hatched a plan.

33
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,546
They started a cleaning business.

34
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,435
They plastered neighborhoods with flyers

35
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,332
and handed business cards out
to their families and friends,

36
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:01,240
and soon, they had clients calling.

37
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:04,662
Two of them would clean
the office or house

38
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:06,552
and one of them would watch the kids.

39
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:09,491
They'd rotate who'd cleaned
and who'd watch the kids.

40
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,728
(Laughs) It's awesome, right?

41
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:12,966
(Laughter)

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,842
And they split the money three ways.

43
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,167
It was not a full-time gig,

44
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:18,422
no one could watch
the little ones all day.

45
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,960
But it made a difference
for their families.

46
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,076
Extra money to pay for bills
when a husband's work hours were cut.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,378
Money to buy the kids clothes
as they were growing.

48
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,321
A little extra money in their pockets

49
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:34,839
to make them feel some independence.

50
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,992
Up in the top-right corner
is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.

51
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:40,931
Brianna is one of those kids

52
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:45,765
with this sparkly, infectious,
outgoing personality.

53
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,501
For example, when Rosie,

54
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,681
a little girl who spoke only Spanish,
moved in next door,

55
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,853
Brianna, who spoke only English,

56
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:56,462
borrowed her mother's tablet
and found a translation app

57
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,266
so the two of them could communicate.

58
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,392
(Laughter)

59
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,598
I know, right?

60
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:04,525
Rosie's family credits Brianna
with helping Rosie to learn English.

61
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,077
A few years ago,

62
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,888
Brianna started to struggle academically.

63
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:14,727
She was growing frustrated
and kind of withdrawn

64
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,999
and acting out in class.

65
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:20,853
And her mother was heartbroken
over what was happening.

66
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:24,959
Then they found out that she was going
to have to repeat second grade

67
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,996
and Brianna was devastated.

68
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,191
Her mother felt hopeless
and overwhelmed and alone

69
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:35,719
because she knew that her daughter
was not getting the support she needed,

70
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,681
and she did not know how to help her.

71
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:41,269
One afternoon, Theresa was catching up
with a group of friends,

72
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:42,852
and one of them said,

73
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,812
"Theresa, how are you?"

74
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,058
And she burst into tears.

75
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:51,145
After she shared her story,
one of her friends said,

76
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:54,446
"I went through the exact same thing
with my son about a year ago."

77
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,621
And in that moment,

78
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,902
Theresa realized
that so much of her struggle

79
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,428
was not having anybody
to talk with about it.

80
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:04,331
So she created a support group
for parents like her.

81
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:08,435
The first meeting was her
and two other people.

82
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,500
But word spread, and soon
20 people, 30 people

83
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:14,899
were showing up for these
monthly meetings that she put together.

84
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,140
She went from feeling helpless

85
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,793
to realizing how capable she was
of supporting her daughter,

86
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:24,498
with the support of other people
who were going through the same struggle.

87
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:27,559
And Brianna is doing fantastic --
she's doing great academically

88
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,760
and socially.

89
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:33,220
That in the middle is my man Baakir,

90
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:36,089
standing in front of
BlackStar Books and Caffe,

91
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:38,698
which he runs out of part of his house.

92
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,297
As you walk in the door,

93
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,705
Baakir greets you
with a "Welcome black home."

94
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,507
(Laughter)

95
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:50,574
Once inside, you can order
some Algiers jerk chicken,

96
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,121
perhaps a vegan walnut burger,

97
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,495
or jive turkey sammich.

98
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,412
And that's sammich -- not sandwich.

99
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:02,667
You must finish your meal
with a buttermilk drop,

100
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,049
which is several steps above a donut hole

101
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,760
and made from a very secret family recipe.

102
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:11,014
For real, it's very secret,
he won't tell you about it.

103
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,697
But BlackStar is much more than a cafÃ©.

104
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:16,651
For the kids in the neighborhood,

105
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,680
it's a place to go after school
to get help with homework.

106
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,497
For the grown-ups, it's where they go

107
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,724
to find out what's going on
in the neighborhood

108
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:25,105
and catch up with friends.

109
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,606
It's a performance venue.

110
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,960
It's a home for poets,
musicians and artists.

111
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,608
Baakir and his partner Nicole,

112
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,772
with their baby girl strapped to her back,

113
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,350
are there in the mix of it all,

114
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:38,445
serving up a cup of coffee,

115
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,609
teaching a child how to play Mancala,

116
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,688
or painting a sign
for an upcoming community event.

117
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:48,428
I have worked with and learned
from people just like them

118
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,093
for more than 20 years.

119
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,960
I have organized
against the prison system,

120
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,317
which impacts poor folks,

121
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:57,885
especially black, indigenous
and Latino folks,

122
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,337
at an alarming rate.

123
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:03,273
I have worked with young people
who manifest hope and promise,

124
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:07,706
despite being at the effect of racist
discipline practices in their schools,

125
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,166
and police violence in their communities.

126
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,491
I have learned from families

127
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:16,197
who are unleashing
their ingenuity and tenacity

128
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,411
to collectively create
their own solutions.

129
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,539
And they're not just focused on money.

130
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:24,607
They're addressing education,
housing, health, community --

131
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,829
the things that we all care about.

132
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,643
Everywhere I go,

133
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,801
I see people who are broke but not broken.

134
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:37,082
I see people who are struggling
to realize their good ideas,

135
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,674
so that they can create
a better life for themselves,

136
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,236
their families, their communities.

137
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:49,804
Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa
and Baakir are the rule,

138
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,444
not the shiny exception.

139
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,253
I am the exception.

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,109
I was raised by a quietly fierce
single mother in Rochester, New York.

141
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,567
I was bussed to a school
in the suburbs, from a neighborhood

142
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:06,478
that many of my classmates
and their parents considered dangerous.

143
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,497
At eight, I was a latchkey kid.

144
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:13,341
I'd get myself home after school every day
and do homework and chores,

145
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,351
and wait for my mother to come home.

146
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,567
After school, I'd go to the corner store

147
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:20,093
and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,

148
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:22,740
which I'd heat up on the stove
as my afternoon snack.

149
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:25,952
If I had a little extra money,
I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.

150
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:26,977
(Laughter)

151
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,152
Cherry.

152
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:29,830
Not as good as a buttermilk drop.

153
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,855
(Laughter)

154
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,573
We were poor when I was a kid.

155
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:36,390
But now, I own a home
in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood

156
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,943
in Oakland, California.

157
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:40,010
I've built a career.

158
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,820
My husband is a business owner.

159
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,369
I have a retirement account.

160
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,882
My daughter is not even allowed
to turn on the stove

161
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,485
unless there's a grown-up at home

162
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,667
and she doesn't have to,

163
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:54,954
because she does not have to have
the same kind of self-reliance

164
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:56,771
that I had to at her age.

165
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:58,999
My kids' raviolis are organic

166
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,930
and full of things
like spinach and ricotta,

167
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,277
because I have the luxury of choice

168
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,219
when it comes to what my children eat.

169
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,343
I am the exception,

170
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,699
not because I'm more talented than Baakir

171
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,605
or my mother worked any harder
than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,

172
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,586
or cared any more than Theresa.

173
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:22,501
Marginalized communities are full
of smart, talented people,

174
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,839
hustling and working and innovating,

175
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:28,804
just like our most revered
and most rewarded CEOs.

176
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:31,461
They are full of people
tapping into their resilience

177
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,987
to get up every day,
get the kids off to school

178
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,997
and go to jobs that don't pay enough,

179
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,489
or get educations
that are putting them in debt.

180
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,654
They are full of people applying
their savvy intelligence

181
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,065
to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,

182
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,276
or balance a job and a side hustle
to make ends meet.

183
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:53,402
They are full of people
doing for themselves and for others,

184
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,930
whether it's picking up medication
for an elderly neighbor,

185
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,688
or letting a sibling borrow some money
to pay the phone bill,

186
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,955
or just watching out
for the neighborhood kids

187
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:04,187
from the front stoop.

188
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:08,646
I am the exception
because of luck and privilege,

189
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,955
not hard work.

190
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,317
And I'm not being modest
or self-deprecating --

191
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,492
I am amazing.

192
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:14,734
(Laughter)

193
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,372
But most people work hard.

194
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,999
Hard work is the common
denominator in this equation,

195
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:23,392
and I'm tired of the story we tell

196
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,024
that hard work leads to success,

197
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,585
because that allows --

198
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,799
Thank you.

199
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:32,314
(Applause)

200
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,122
... because that story allows those of us
who make it to believe we deserve it,

201
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,379
and by implication,

202
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,636
those who don't make it don't deserve it.

203
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:44,378
We tell ourselves,
in the back of our minds,

204
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,677
and sometimes in the front of our mouths,

205
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:49,738
"There must be something a little wrong
with those poor people."

206
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:51,254
We have a wide range of beliefs

207
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:53,463
about what that something wrong is.

208
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,771
Some people tell the story
that poor folks are lazy freeloaders

209
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,977
who would cheat and lie
to get out of an honest day's work.

210
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:03,200
Others prefer the story
that poor people are helpless

211
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:06,505
and probably had neglectful parents
that didn't read to them enough,

212
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:08,738
and if they were just told what to do

213
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,019
and shown the right path,

214
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,284
they could make it.

215
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:18,056
For every story I hear demonizing
low-income single mothers

216
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,429
or absentee fathers,

217
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,195
which is how people
might think of my parents,

218
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:27,081
I've got 50 that tell a different story
about the same people,

219
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:30,015
showing up every day and doing their best.

220
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:34,207
I'm not saying that some
of the negative stories aren't true,

221
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:40,595
but those stories allow us
to not really see who people really are,

222
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,806
because they don't paint a full picture.

223
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:47,098
The quarter-truths and limited
plot lines have us convinced

224
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:50,380
that poor people are a problem
that needs fixing.

225
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,839
What if we recognized
that what's working is the people

226
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,417
and what's broken is our approach?

227
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,966
What if we realized that the experts
we are looking for,

228
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,786
the experts we need to follow,

229
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,731
are poor people themselves?

230
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,758
What if, instead of imposing solutions,

231
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,881
we just added fire

232
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,849
to the already-burning flame
that they have?

233
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,030
Not directing --

234
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,644
not even empowering --

235
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,897
but just fueling their initiative.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,357
Just north of here,

237
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,548
we have an example
of what this could look like:

238
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:27,822
Silicon Valley.

239
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:32,671
A whole venture capital industry
has grown up around the belief

240
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:36,983
that if people have good ideas
and the desire to manifest them,

241
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:41,004
we should give them lots
and lots and lots of money.

242
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:42,150
(Laughter)

243
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:46,015
Right? But where is our strategy
for Theresa and Baakir?

244
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,423
There are no incubators for them,

245
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,156
no accelerators, no fellowships.

246
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:56,252
How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
really all that different

247
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,914
from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?

248
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,922
Baakir has experience and a track record.

249
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:03,655
I'd put my money on him.

250
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:11,405
So, consider this an invitation
to rethink a flawed strategy.

251
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,960
Let's grasp this opportunity

252
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,801
to let go of a tired, faulty narrative

253
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:21,862
and listen and look for true stories,

254
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,899
more beautifully complex stories,

255
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:28,768
about who marginalized people
and families and communities are.

256
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,272
I'm going to take a minute
to speak to my people.

257
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,446
We cannot wait

258
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,850
for somebody else to get it right.

259
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:48,292
Let us remember what we are capable of;

260
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:52,185
all that we have built
with blood, sweat and dreams;

261
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,988
all the cogs that keep turning;

262
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:57,684
and the people kept afloat
because of our backbreaking work.

263
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,066
Let us remember that we are magic.

264
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:03,597
If you need some inspiration
to jog your memory,

265
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:06,591
read Octavia Butler's
"Parable of the Sower."

266
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:10,004
Listen to Reverend King's
"Letter from Birmingham Jail."

267
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,648
Listen to Suheir Hammad recite
"First Writing Since,"

268
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,721
or Esperanza Spalding
perform "Black Gold."

269
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:20,393
Set your gaze upon the art
of Kehinde Wiley

270
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,271
or Favianna Rodriguez.

271
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:28,499
Look at the hands of your grandmother

272
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,195
or into the eyes of someone who loves you.

273
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,254
We are magic.

274
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,957
Individually, we don't have
a lot of wealth and power,

275
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:41,488
but collectively, we are unstoppable.

276
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,385
And we spend a lot of our time and energy

277
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:50,608
organizing our power to demand change
from systems that were not made for us.

278
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:55,070
Instead of trying to alter
the fabric of existing ways,

279
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,871
let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.

280
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:01,845
Let's use some of our
substantial collective power

281
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,841
toward inventing and bringing to life

282
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,812
new ways of being that work for us.

283
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:12,358
Desmond Tutu talks
about the concept of ubuntu,

284
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:16,037
in the context of South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation process

285
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,354
that they embarked on after apartheid.

286
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,713
He says it means,

287
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:26,263
"My humanity is caught up,
is inextricably bound up, in yours;

288
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:30,833
we belong to a bundle of life."

289
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,568
A bundle of life.

290
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,807
The Truth and Reconciliation process

291
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,481
started by elevating
the voices of the unheard.

292
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:48,009
If this country is going to live up to its
promise of liberty and justice for all,

293
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:51,122
then we need to elevate
the voices of our unheard,

294
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,627
of people like Jobana,
Sintia and Bertha,

295
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,118
Theresa and Baakir.

296
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,794
We must leverage their solutions
and their ideas.

297
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:04,567
We must listen to their true stories,

298
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,241
their more beautifully complex stories.

299
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,116
Thank you.

300
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,984
(Applause)
