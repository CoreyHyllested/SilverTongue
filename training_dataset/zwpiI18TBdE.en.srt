0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,776
Today I stand before you
as a man who lives life to the full

1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,040
in the here and now.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,936
But for a long time,

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,160
I lived for death.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,536
I was a young man who believed

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,120
that jihad is to be understood
in the language of force and violence.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,000
I tried to right wrongs
through power and aggression.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,880
I had deep concerns
for the suffering of others

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,000
and a strong desire
to help and bring relief to them.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,456
I thought violent jihad was noble,

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,816
chivalrous

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,160
and the best way to help.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,536
At a time when so many of our people --

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,816
young people especially --

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,400
are at risk of radicalization

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,096
through groups like al-Qaeda,

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,960
Islamic State and others,

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,336
when these groups are claiming

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,416
that their horrific brutality
and violence are true jihad,

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,616
I want to say that their idea
of jihad is wrong --

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,976
completely wrong --

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
as was mine, then.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,560
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,456
It includes exertion and spirituality,

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,976
self-purification

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
and devotion.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,256
It refers to positive transformation

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,376
through learning, wisdom
and remembrance of God.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,640
The word jihad stands
for all those meanings as a whole.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,336
Jihad may at times
take the form of fighting,

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
but only sometimes,

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
under strict conditions,

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
within rules and limits.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,056
In Islam,

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,080
the benefit of an act must outweigh
the harm or hardship it entails.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,976
More importantly,

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,736
the verses in the Koran
that are connected to jihad or fighting

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,336
do not cancel out the verses
that talk about forgiveness,

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,656
benevolence

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
or patience.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,896
But now I believe that there are
no circumstances on earth

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,496
where violent jihad is permissible,

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,200
because it will lead to greater harm.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,296
But now the idea of jihad
has been hijacked.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,656
It has been perverted
to mean violent struggle

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,656
wherever Muslims
are undergoing difficulties,

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,576
and turned into terrorism

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,656
by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Islamic State and others.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,256
But I have come to understand

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,216
that true jihad
means striving to the utmost

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,600
to strengthen and live
those qualities which God loves:

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,776
honesty, trustworthiness,

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,896
compassion, benevolence,

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,816
reliability, respect,

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,216
truthfulness --

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,360
human values that so many of us share.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,216
I was born in Bangladesh,

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,669
but grew up mostly in England.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,719
And I went to school here.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,776
My father was an academic,

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,880
and we were in the UK through his work.

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,840
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh
when everything changed.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,776
The War of Independence
impacted upon us terribly,

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,656
pitting family against family,

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,376
neighbor against neighbor.

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,256
And at the age of 12 I experienced war,

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
destitution in my family,

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,960
the deaths of 22
of my relatives in horrible ways,

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,760
as well as the murder of my elder brother.

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,800
I witnessed killing ...

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,816
animals feeding on corpses in the streets,

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,576
starvation all around me,

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,736
wanton, horrific violence --

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
senseless violence.

75
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,016
I was a young man,

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,976
teenager, fascinated by ideas.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,816
I wanted to learn,

78
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,888
but I could not go to school
for four years.

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,216
After the War of Independence,

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
my father was put in prison
for two and a half years,

81
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,360
and I used to visit him
every week in prison,

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,600
and homeschooled myself.

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,640
My father was released in 1973

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,096
and he fled to England as a refugee,

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
and we soon followed him.

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,376
I was 17.

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,856
So these experiences gave me

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,680
a sharp awareness of the atrocities
and injustices in the world.

89
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,136
And I had a strong desire --

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,176
a very keen, deep desire --

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,416
to right wrongs

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,107
and help the victims of oppression.

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,536
While studying at college in the UK,

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,040
I met others who showed me
how I could channel that desire

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
and help through my religion.

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,016
And I was radicalized --

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,480
enough to consider violence correct,

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
even a virtue under certain circumstances.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,536
So I became involved
in the jihad in Afghanistan.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,120
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan
population against the Soviet army.

101
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,336
And I thought that was jihad:

102
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,856
my sacred duty,

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,600
which would be rewarded by God.

104
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
I became a preacher.

105
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,056
I was one of the pioneers
of violent jihad in the UK.

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,576
I recruited,

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
I raised funds, I trained.

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,896
I confused true jihad

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
with this perversion
as presented by the fascist Islamists --

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,736
these people who use the idea of jihad

111
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,640
to justify their lust for power,
authority and control on earth:

112
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:18,056
a perversion perpetuated today
by fascist Islamist groups

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,960
like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,280
For a period of around 15 years,

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,280
I fought for short periods of time

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,976
in Kashmir and Burma,

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,320
besides Afghanistan.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Our aim was to remove the invaders,

119
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,840
to bring relief to the oppressed victims

120
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,016
and of course to establish
an Islamic state,

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,760
a caliphate for God's rule.

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
And I did this openly.

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,760
I didn't break any laws.

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,536
I was proud and grateful to be British --

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,136
I still am.

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,800
And I bore no hostility
against this, my country,

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,496
nor enmity towards
the non-Muslim citizens,

128
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
and I still don't.

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,216
During one battle in Afghanistan,

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
some British men and I
formed a special bond

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,696
with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
Abdullah,

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,176
an innocent, loving and lovable kid

134
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,240
who was always eager to please.

135
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
He was poor.

136
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,480
And boys like him
did menial tasks in the camp.

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,766
And he seemed happy enough,

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,896
but I couldn't help wonder --

139
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,825
his parents must have missed him dearly.

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,120
And they must have dreamt
about a better future for him.

141
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,376
A victim of circumstance
caught up in a war,

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
cruelly thrust upon him

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
by the cruel circumstances of the time.

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,400
One day I picked up this unexploded
mortar shell in a trench,

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,120
and I had it deposited
in a makeshift mud hut lab.

146
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,216
And I went out on a short,
pointless skirmish --

147
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
always pointless,

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,880
And I came back a few hours later
to discover he was dead.

149
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,936
He had tried to recover
explosives from that shell.

150
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,560
It exploded, and he died a violent death,

151
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,720
blown to bits by the very same device
that had proved harmless to me.

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
So I started to question.

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,320
How did his death serve any purpose?

154
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Why did he die and I lived?

155
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,056
I carried on.

156
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,696
I fought in Kashmir.

157
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,416
I also recruited for the Philippines,

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Bosnia and Chechnya.

159
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,840
And the questions grew.

160
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,776
Later in Burma,

161
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,136
I came across Rohingya fighters,

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,416
who were barely teenagers,

163
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,096
born and brought up in the jungle,

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,180
carrying machine guns
and grenade launchers.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,200
I met two 13-year-olds
with soft manners and gentle voices.

166
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,136
Looking at me,

167
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
they begged me
to take them away to England.

168
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
They simply wanted to go to school --

169
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
that was their dream.

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,576
My family --

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,056
my children of the same age --

172
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,040
were living at home in the UK,

173
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,336
going to school,

174
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
living a safe life.

175
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,136
And I couldn't help wonder

176
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,616
how much these young boys
must have spoken to one another

177
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,840
about their dreams for such a life.

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
Victims of circumstances:

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,640
these two young boys,

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,376
sleeping rough on the ground,
looking up at the stars,

181
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,896
cynically exploited by their leaders

182
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,400
for their personal lust
for glory and power.

183
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,136
I soon witnessed boys like them
killing one another

184
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,400
in conflicts between rival groups.

185
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,760
And it was the same everywhere ...

186
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,776
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,

187
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
Philippines, Chechnya;

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,856
petty warlords got the young
and vulnerable to kill one another

189
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,200
in the name of jihad.

190
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Muslims against Muslims.

191
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,016
Not protecting anyone
against invaders or occupiers;

192
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
not bringing relief to the oppressed.

193
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,616
Children being used,

194
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,256
cynically exploited;

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,216
people dying in conflicts

196
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,280
which I was supporting
in the name of jihad.

197
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,560
And it still carries on today.

198
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,416
Realizing that the violent jihad

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,640
I had engaged in abroad

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
was so different --

201
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,016
such a chasm between
what I had experienced

202
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,840
and what I thought was sacred duty --

203
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
I had to reflect
on my activities here in the UK.

204
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,296
I had to consider my preaching,

205
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,856
recruiting, fund-raising,

206
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,456
training,

207
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
but most importantly, radicalizing --

208
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,856
sending young people to fight and die

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,096
as I was doing --

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,880
all totally wrong.

211
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,880
So I got involved
in violent jihad in the mid '80s,

212
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
starting with Afghanistan.

213
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,880
And by the time I finished
it was in the year 2000.

214
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,616
I was completely immersed in it.

215
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,576
All around me people supported,

216
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,816
applauded,

217
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,240
even celebrated what
we were doing in their name.

218
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,976
But by the time I learned to get out,

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,616
completely disillusioned in the year 2000,

220
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,320
15 years had passed.

221
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
So what goes wrong?

222
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,560
We were so busy talking about virtue,

223
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,320
and we were blinded by a cause.

224
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,520
And we did not give ourselves a chance
to develop a virtuous character.

225
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,816
We told ourselves
we were fighting for the oppressed,

226
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
but these were unwinnable wars.

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,336
We became the very instrument
through which more deaths occurred,

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,096
complicit in causing further misery

229
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,720
for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,496
So over time,

231
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,720
a very long time,

232
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
I opened my eyes.

233
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
I began to dare

234
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,696
to face the truth,

235
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
to think,

236
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,496
to face the hard questions.

237
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,720
I got in touch with my soul.

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,400
What have I learned?

239
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,200
That people who engage
in violent jihadism,

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,560
that people who are drawn
to these types of extremisms,

241
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
are not that different to everyone else.

242
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,680
But I believe such people can change.

243
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,976
They can regain their hearts
and restore them

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,060
by filling them
with human values that heal.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,216
When we ignore the realities,

246
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,000
we discover that we accept what
we are told without critical reflection.

247
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,416
And we ignore the gifts and advantages
that many of us would cherish

248
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,720
even for a single moment in their lives.

249
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,760
I engaged in actions
I thought were correct.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
But now I began to question
how I knew what I knew.

251
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,536
I endlessly told others
to accept the truth,

252
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,280
but I failed to give doubt
its rightful place.

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,776
This conviction that people can change
is rooted in my experience,

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
my own journey.

255
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,416
Through wide reading,

256
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
reflecting,

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,056
contemplation, self-knowledge,

258
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,296
I discovered,

259
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,960
I realized that Islamists' world
of us and them is false and unjust.

260
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,480
Through considering the uncertainties
in all that we had asserted,

261
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,016
to the inviolable truths,

262
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
incontestable truths,

263
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,840
I developed a more nuanced understanding.

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,960
I realized that in a world crowded
with variation and contradiction,

265
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,136
foolish preachers,

266
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,176
only foolish preachers
like I used to be,

267
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,560
see no paradox in the myths and fictions
they use to assert authenticity.

268
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,656
So I understood the vital
importance of self-knowledge,

269
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
political awareness

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,656
and the necessity
for a deep and wide understanding

271
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,136
of our commitments and our actions,

272
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
how they affect others.

273
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,976
So my plea today to everyone,

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
especially those who sincerely
believe in Islamist jihadism ...

275
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
refuse dogmatic authority;

276
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,040
let go of anger, hatred and violence;

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,776
learn to right wrongs

278
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,870
without even attempting to justify
cruel, unjust and futile behavior.

279
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,176
Instead create a few
beautiful and useful things

280
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
that outlive us.

281
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,056
Approach the world, life,

282
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,280
with love.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,216
Learn to develop

284
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,496
or cultivate your hearts

285
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,880
to see goodness, beauty and truth
in others and in the world.

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,520
That way we do matter
more to ourselves ...

287
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
to each other,

288
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,376
to our communities

289
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
and, for me, to God.

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,616
This is jihad --

291
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
my true jihad.

292
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,136
Thank you.

293
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,600
(Applause)
