00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:19,636
This summer I was back
in Ohio for a family wedding,

1
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:21,985
and when I was there,

2
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:25,338
there was a meet and greet
with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

3
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:29,103
Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"

4
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:31,833
as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.

5
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:36,433
These two entrepreneurs had
a business of running princess parties.

6
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:38,017
Your kid is turning five?

7
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:41,544
They'll come sing some songs,
sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.

8
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:45,168
And they were not about
to miss out on the opportunity

9
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,803
that was the phenomenon
and that was "Frozen."

10
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:49,700
So they get hired by a local toy store,

11
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,457
kids come in on a Saturday morning,

12
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,557
buy some Disney swag, get their
picture taken with the princesses,

13
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:56,160
call it a day.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,856
It's like Santa Claus
without the seasonal restrictions.

15
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:00,462
(Laughter)

16
00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:05,550
And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece
Samantha was in the thick of it.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,672
She could care less that these two women
were signing posters and coloring books

18
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:15,956
as Snow Queen and Princess Ana
with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.

19
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:17,122
(Laughter)

20
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:21,818
According to my niece and the 200-plus
kids in the parking lot that day,

21
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:26,542
this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

22
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:33,597
It is a blazing hot Saturday morning
in August in Ohio.

23
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:36,872
We get there at 10 o'clock,
the scheduled start time,

24
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:39,105
and we are handed number 59.

25
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:43,673
By 11 o'clock they had called
numbers 21 through 25;

26
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:45,426
this was going to be a while,

27
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:49,891
and there is no amount
of free face painting or temporary tattoos

28
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,396
that could prevent the meltdowns
that were occurring outside of the store.

29
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,971
(Laughter)

30
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:59,113
So, by 12:30 we get called:

31
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,306
"56 to 63, please."

32
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:05,677
And as we walk in, it is a scene
I can only describe you

33
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:08,567
as saying it looked like Norway threw up.

34
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:09,947
(Laughter)

35
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:14,333
There were cardboard
cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,

36
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,252
glitter on every flat surface,
and icicles all over the walls.

37
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,063
And as we stood in line

38
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:23,596
in an attempt to give
my niece a better vantage point

39
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:26,151
than the backside
of the mother of number 58,

40
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,879
I put her up on my shoulders,

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,978
and she was instantly riveted
by the sight of the princesses.

42
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,519
And as we moved forward,
her excitement only grew,

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,804
and as we finally got
to the front of the line,

44
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:40,497
and number 58 unfurled her poster
to be signed by the princesses,

45
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:44,097
I could literally feel the excitement
running through her body.

46
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,062
And let's be honest,
at that point, I was pretty excited too.

47
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,457
(Laughter)

48
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,456
I mean, the Scandinavian decadence
was mesmerizing.

49
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,625
(Laughter)

50
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,535
So we get to the front of the line,

51
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,545
and the haggard clerk
turns to my niece and says,

52
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,365
"Hi, honey. You're next!

53
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,655
Do you want to get down,
or you're going to stay

54
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,912
on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'

55
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,399
(Laughter)

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,261
And I was, for a lack
of a better word, frozen.

57
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:10,873
(Laughter)

58
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:15,666
It's amazing that in an unexpected instant
we are faced with the question,

59
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,997
who am I?

60
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:20,465
Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?

61
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,296
Millions of people have seen my video
about how to have a hard conversation,

62
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,613
and there one was, right in front of me.

63
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,685
At the same time,

64
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,595
there's nothing more important
to me than the kids in my life,

65
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:34,543
so I found myself in a situation
that we so often find ourselves in,

66
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:37,766
torn between two things,
two impossible choices.

67
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,793
Would I be an advocate?

68
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:44,341
Would I take my niece off my shoulders
and turn to the clerk and explain to her

69
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:47,479
that I was in fact
her aunt, not her father,

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,848
and that she should be more careful

71
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,604
and not to jump to gender conclusions
based on haircuts and shoulder rides --

72
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,740
(Laughter) --

73
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,597
and while doing that,

74
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,386
miss out on what was, to this point,
the greatest moment of my niece's life.

75
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,205
Or would I be an aunt?

76
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:08,343
Would I brush off that comment,
take a million pictures,

77
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:13,321
and not be distracted for an instant
from the pure joy of that moment,

78
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,840
and by doing that,

79
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:18,223
walk out with the shame that comes up
for not standing up for myself,

80
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,606
especially in front of my niece.

81
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,409
Who was I?

82
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,228
Which one was more important?
Which role was more worth it?

83
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,218
Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?

84
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,435
And I had a split second to decide.

85
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,813
We are taught right now

86
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:40,112
that we are living in a world
of constant and increasing polarity.

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,684
It's so black and white,
so us and them, so right and wrong.

88
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:49,691
There is no middle,
there is no gray, just polarity.

89
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,131
Polarity is a state in which
two ideas or opinions

90
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,712
are completely opposite from each other;

91
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,866
a diametrical opposition.

92
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,581
Which side are you on?

93
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:04,646
Are you unequivocally and without question
antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,

94
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:08,104
pro-gun regulation, proponent
of open borders and pro-union?

95
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:13,337
Or, are you absolutely
and uncompromisingly

96
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,522
pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,

97
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,838
a believer that the Second
Amendment is absolute,

98
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:19,542
anti-immigrant and pro-business?

99
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,787
It's all or none, you're with us
or against us.

100
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,507
That is polarity.

101
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:29,190
The problem with polarity
and absolutes is that

102
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:34,355
it eliminates the individuality
of our human experience

103
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:38,381
and that makes it contradictory
to our human nature.

104
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,297
But if we are pulled
in these two directions,

105
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,077
but it's not really where we exist --

106
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,507
polarity is not our actual reality --

107
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:46,887
where do we go from there?

108
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:50,367
What's at the other end of that spectrum?

109
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:54,407
I don't think it's an unattainable,
harmonious utopia,

110
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:57,841
I think the opposite
of polarity is duality.

111
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:00,446
Duality is a state of having two parts,

112
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,729
but not in diametrical opposition,

113
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,675
in simultaneous existence.

114
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,662
Don't think it's possible?

115
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,333
Here are the people I know:

116
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,497
I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
and feminists who wear hijabs,

117
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,201
and veterans who are antiwar,

118
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:17,986
and NRA members who think
I should be able to get married.

119
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:21,022
Those are the people I know,
those are my friends and family,

120
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:23,999
that is the majority of our society,
that is you, that is me.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,657
(Applause)

122
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:37,885
Duality is the ability
to hold both things.

123
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:42,007
But the question is:
Can we own our duality?

124
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,730
Can we have the courage
to hold both things?

125
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,422
I work at a restaurant in town,

126
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:51,032
I became really good friends
with the busser.

127
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:54,050
I was a server and we had
a great relationship,

128
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,990
we had a really great time together.

129
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,608
Her Spanish was great

130
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,450
because she was from Mexico.

131
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,312
(Laughter)

132
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:05,746
That line actually went the other way.

133
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:09,668
Her English was limited,
but significantly better than my Spanish.

134
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,677
But we were united by our similarities,

135
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,578
not separated by our differences.

136
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:21,698
And we were close, even though
we came from very different worlds.

137
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:22,838
She was from Mexico,

138
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:26,169
she left her family behind
so she could come here

139
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,149
and afford them a better life back home.

140
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,106
She was a devout conservative Catholic,

141
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,826
a believer in traditional family values,

142
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,932
stereotypical roles of men and women,

143
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,727
and I was, well, me.

144
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,632
(Laughter)

145
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:44,318
But the things that bonded us
were when she asked about my girlfriend,

146
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,787
or she shared pictures that she had
from her family back home.

147
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,415
Those were the things
that brought us together.

148
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,002
So one day, we were in the back,

149
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:55,682
scarfing down food as quickly as we could,
gathered around a small table,

150
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,313
during a very rare lull,

151
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,323
and a new guy
from the kitchen came over --

152
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,985
who happened to be her cousin --

153
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,787
and sat down with all
the bravado and machismo

154
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:05,949
that his 20-year-old body could hold.

155
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,771
(Laughter)

156
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:12,744
And he said to her,
[in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"

157
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:17,856
And she said,
[in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."

158
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:22,911
And he said,
[in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"

159
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:26,024
And she set down her fork,
and locked eyes with him,

160
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:31,047
and said, [in Spanish] "Yes,
a girlfriend. That is all."

161
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:35,940
And his smug smile quickly dropped
to one of maternal respect,

162
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:39,143
grabbed his plate, walked off,
went back to work.

163
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,878
She never made eye contact with me.

164
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,383
She left, did the same thing --

165
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,654
it was a 10-second conversation,
such a short interaction.

166
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:49,191
And on paper, she had
so much more in common with him:

167
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:54,289
language, culture, history, family,
her community was her lifeline here,

168
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:58,460
but her moral compass trumped all of that.

169
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:02,123
And a little bit later, they were joking
around in the kitchen in Spanish,

170
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,024
that had nothing to do with me,

171
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,469
and that is duality.

172
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,983
She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance
on gayness over her heritage.

173
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,133
She didn't have to choose
her family over our friendship.

174
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,408
It wasn't Jesus or Ash.

175
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,376
(Laughter)

176
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:22,493
(Applause)

177
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,760
Her individual morality
was so strongly rooted

178
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:35,142
that she had the courage
to hold both things.

179
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:38,324
Our moral integrity is our responsibility

180
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:42,556
and we must be prepared to defend it
even when it's not convenient.

181
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:45,870
That's what it means to be an ally,
and if you're going to be an ally,

182
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,157
you have to be an active ally:

183
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:52,045
Ask questions, act when you hear
something inappropriate,

184
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,074
actually engage.

185
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:58,508
I had a family friend who for years
used to call my girlfriend my lover.

186
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,975
Really? Lover?

187
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:05,000
So overly sexual,

188
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:07,046
so '70s gay porn.

189
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,253
(Laughter)

190
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:13,788
But she was trying, and she asked.

191
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,572
She could have called her my friend,

192
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,707
or my "friend," or my "special friend" --

193
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,092
(Laughter) --

194
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,058
or even worse, just not asked at all.

195
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,689
Believe me, we would rather have you ask.

196
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,931
I would rather have her say lover,
than say nothing at all.

197
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,963
People often say to me,
"Well, Ash, I don't care.

198
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,756
I don't see race
or religion or sexuality.

199
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:42,600
It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."

200
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,244
But I think the opposite of homophobia
and racism and xenophobia is not love,

201
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,858
it's apathy.

202
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,962
If you don't see my gayness,
then you don't see me.

203
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,948
If it doesn't matter to you
who I sleep with,

204
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,134
then you cannot imagine what it feels like

205
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:03,011
when I walk down the street
late at night holding her hand,

206
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,829
and approach a group of people
and have to make the decision

207
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,174
if I should hang on to it
or if I should I drop it

208
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,493
when all I want to do
is squeeze it tighter.

209
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,011
And the small victory I feel

210
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,719
when I make it by
and don't have to let go.

211
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,838
And the incredible cowardice
and disappointment I feel when I drop it.

212
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,787
If you do not see that struggle

213
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:29,263
that is unique to my human experience
because I am gay, then you don't see me.

214
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:34,678
If you are going to be an ally,
I need you to see me.

215
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,622
As individuals, as allies, as humans,

216
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,622
we need to be able to hold both things:

217
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:43,070
both the good and the bad,

218
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,900
the easy and the hard.

219
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,371
You don't learn how to hold
two things just from the fluff,

220
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:51,773
you learn it from the grit.

221
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:55,158
And what if duality
is just the first step?

222
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:01,137
What if through compassion
and empathy and human interaction

223
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,532
we are able to learn to hold two things?

224
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,847
And if we can hold
two things, we can hold four,

225
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:07,858
and if we can hold four,
we can hold eight,

226
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,099
and if we can hold eight,
we can hold hundreds.

227
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,562
We are complex individuals,

228
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,362
swirls of contradiction.

229
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,967
You are all holding
so many things right now.

230
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:21,330
What can you do to hold just a few more?

231
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,237
So, back to Toledo, Ohio.

232
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,417
I'm at the front of the line,

233
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:30,519
niece on my shoulders,
the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.

234
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Have you ever been mistaken
for the wrong gender?

235
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,309
Not even that.

236
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,759
Have you ever been called
something you are not?

237
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,039
Here's what it feels like for me:

238
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,113
I am instantly an internal storm
of contrasting emotions.

239
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:55,656
I break out into a sweat that is
a combination of rage and humiliation,

240
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:58,617
I feel like the entire store
is staring at me,

241
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,178
and I simultaneously feel invisible.

242
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,122
I want to explode in a tirade of fury,

243
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,716
and I want to crawl under a rock.

244
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,819
And top all of that off
with the frustration that I'm wearing

245
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,418
an out-of-character
tight-fitting purple t-shirt,

246
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,456
so this whole store can see my boobs,

247
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:18,457
to make sure this exact
same thing doesn't happen.

248
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,640
(Laughter)

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,962
But, despite my best efforts
to be seen as the gender I am,

250
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,803
it still happens.

251
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:31,496
And I hope with every ounce
of my body that no one heard --

252
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:36,050
not my sister, not my girlfriend,
and certainly not my niece.

253
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,491
I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,

254
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:42,566
but I will do whatever I need to do
to protect the people I love from it.

255
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,440
But then I take my niece off my shoulders,

256
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,615
and she runs to Elsa and Anna --

257
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,182
the thing she's been
waiting so long for --

258
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,270
and all that stuff goes away.

259
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,980
All that matters is the smile on her face.

260
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,637
And as the 30 seconds we waited
two and a half hours for comes to a close

261
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:07,841
we gather up our things,
and I lock eyes with the clerk again;

262
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,978
and she gives me
an apologetic smile and mouths,

263
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,275
"I am so sorry!"

264
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,385
(Laughter)

265
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:21,242
And her humanity, her willingness to admit
her mistake disarms me immediately,

266
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:26,415
then I give her a: "It's okay,
it happens. But thanks."

267
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,406
And I realize in that moment

268
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,444
that I don't have to be

269
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:35,643
either an aunt
or an advocate, I can be both.

270
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:42,251
I can live in duality,
and I can hold two things.

271
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,189
And if I can hold two things
in that environment,

272
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,542
I can hold so many more things.

273
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:51,295
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands
and skip out the front of the door,

274
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:54,039
I turn to my sister and say,
"Was it worth it?"

275
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,814
And she said, "Are you kidding me?

276
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:59,702
Did you see the look on her face?
This was the greatest day of her life!"

277
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:00,800
(Laughter)

278
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,758
"It was worth the two
and a half hours in the heat,

279
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,146
it was worth the overpriced coloring book
that we already had a copy of."

280
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,854
(Laughter)

281
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:13,509
"It was even worth you
getting called Dad."

282
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,615
(Laughter)

283
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:22,919
And for the first time ever
in my life, it actually was.

284
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,098
Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night.

285
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,619
(Applause)
