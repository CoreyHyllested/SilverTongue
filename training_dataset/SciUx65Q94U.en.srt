0
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:16,244
Five hundred seventy-one million

1
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:22,551
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

2
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:24,438
are used by Americans

3
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:28,109
every year.

4
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,164
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

5
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,515
13 billion used every year.

6
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:36,618
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

7
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:39,800
one paper towel per person per day,

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,681
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

9
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,816
We can do that.

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,746
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.

11
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,977
There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.

12
00:00:56,977 --> 00:01:01,140
There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,404
People go one, two, three, four, tear.

14
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:04,842
This much, right?

15
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:07,307
There's the one that cuts itself.

16
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:11,447
People go, one, two, three, four.

17
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:15,522
Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,

18
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:20,035
you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.

19
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:26,556
The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.

20
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:28,596
The key, two words:

21
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:33,044
This half of the room, your word is "shake."

22
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:35,226
Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.

23
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:36,771
Audience: Shake.

24
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:38,947
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."

25
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:40,063
Audience: Fold.

26
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:40,990
JS: Again.

27
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,059
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.

28
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,607
Audience: Shake. Fold.

29
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:48,767
JS: OK. Wet hands.

30
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:53,567
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

31
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,505
Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,

32
00:01:56,505 --> 00:02:00,612
twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:

33
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:02,809
It's the biggest number with one syllable.

34
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:07,071
(Laughter)

35
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:14,431
Tri-fold. Fold ...

36
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:15,983
Dry.

37
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:20,215
(Applause)

38
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:25,429
Audience: Shake.

39
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:28,361
Fold.

40
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,939
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important

41
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,821
because it allows interstitial suspension.

42
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,299
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.

43
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,352
(Laughter)

44
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:50,069
Audience: Shake. Fold.

45
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,731
JS: Cuts itself.

46
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:56,888
You know the funny thing is,

47
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:59,063
I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,

48
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,511
because they can't get in between the cracks.

49
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,655
If you think this isn't as good...

50
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:13,124
Audience: Shake. Fold.

51
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:16,692
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,

52
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:19,099
it's the one where you wave your hand

53
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,890
and it kicks it out.

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,976
It's way too big a towel.

55
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:24,003
Let me tell you a secret.

56
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,090
If you're really quick, if you're really quick --

57
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,670
and I can prove this --

58
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,519
this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.

59
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,886
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.

60
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:37,558
It's smart enough to stop.

61
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:41,550
And you get half a towel.

62
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:54,827
Audience: Shake. Fold.

63
00:03:54,827 --> 00:04:01,661
JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.

64
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,804
You will for the rest of your life remember those words

65
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,787
every time you pick up a paper towel.

66
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:13,875
And remember, one towel per person for one year --

67
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:18,595
571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.

68
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,843
And next year, toilet paper.

69
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,219
(Laughter)
