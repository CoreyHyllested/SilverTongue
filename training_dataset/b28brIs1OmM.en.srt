0
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,800
"Mom, who are these people?"

1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,096
It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Alia

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,256
around the time when she was three.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,376
We were walking along with my husband

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,176
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,496
Alia was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,880
It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,216
As she tucked in my side,

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,456
I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,736
who had worked hard
to develop their nation

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,000
and preserve its unity.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,896
She asked, "Mom, why is it
that here where we live,

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,576
and back in Lebanon,
where grandma and grandpa live,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,736
we never see the pictures
of powerful women on the walls?

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Is it because women are not important?"

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,856
This is probably the hardest question
I've had to answer in my years as a parent

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,320
and in my 16-plus years
of professional life, for that matter.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,096
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,576
the younger of two daughters
to a very hard-working pilot

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,216
and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,056
My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,376
even though our culture
emphasized at the time

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,016
I was one of very few girls
of my generation

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,440
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,296
My father didn't have a son,

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,320
and so I, in a sense, became his.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,576
Fast-forward a couple of decades,
and I hope I didn't do too badly

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,200
in making my father proud
of his would-be son.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,816
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD
in electrical engineering,

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,680
did R&amp;D in the UK,
then consulting in the Middle East,

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,960
I have always been
in male-dominated environments.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,200
Truth be told, I have never found
a role model I could truly identify with.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,002
My mother's generation
wasn't into professional leadership.

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,056
There were some
encouraging men along the way,

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
but none knew the demands
and pressures I was facing,

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,639
pressures that got particularly acute
when I had my own two beautiful children.

38
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,320
And although Western women love to give us
poor, oppressed Arab women advice,

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,920
they live different lives
with different constraints.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,216
So Arab women of my generation
have had to become our own role models.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,496
We have had to juggle more than Arab men,

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,880
and we have had to face
more cultural rigidity than Western women.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,816
As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,320
actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,016
lessons that might turn out useful

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,600
for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,736
Here are three of mine.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,616
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,856
(Laughter)

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
(Applause)

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,656
There is this word that everybody
is touting as the key to success:

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,920
resilience.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,560
Well, what exactly is resilience,
and how do you develop it?

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,800
I believe resilience is simply
the ability to transform shit into fuel.

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,456
In my previous job,
well before my current firm,

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,600
I was working with a man
we will call John.

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,816
I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,816
hoping he would notice how great I was

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,160
and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,216
I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,400
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,920
One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,136
John was part of the audience

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,800
listening for the first time
to the details of my study.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,296
As I proceeded with my presentation,

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,520
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,536
He had turned a dark shade of pink

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,360
and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,296
I finished my presentation
to an applauding audience

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,400
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,360
There he exploded.

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,216
"What you did up there was unacceptable!

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,440
You are a consultant, not an activist!"

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,056
I said, "John, I don't understand.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,736
I presented a couple of
gender parity indices,

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,815
and some conclusions about the Arab world.

77
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,815
Yes, we do happen to be today
at the bottom of the index,

78
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,040
but what is it that I said or presented
that was not factual?"

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,096
To which he replied,
"The whole premise of your study is wrong.

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
What you are doing is dangerous and will
break the social fabric of our society."

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,096
He paused, then added,

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,520
"When women have children,
their place is in the home."

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,616
Time stood still for a long while,

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,336
and all I could think and repeat
in the chaos of my brain was:

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,536
"You can forget about
that partnership, Leila.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,132
It's just never going to happen."

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,576
It took me a couple of days to fully
absorb this incident and its implications,

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,240
but once I did,
I reached three conclusions.

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,696
One, that these were his issues,

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,216
his complexes.

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,296
There may be many like him in our society,

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,520
but I would never let
their issues become mine.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,336
Two, that I needed
another sponsor, and fast.

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,576
(Laughter)

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,816
I got one, by the way,
and boy, was he great.

96
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,256
And three, that I would get to show John
what women with children can do.

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,696
I apply this lesson equally well
to my personal life.

98
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,496
As I have progressed in my career,

99
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,976
I have received many words
of encouragement,

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,296
but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,056
who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

102
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,600
having chosen the path
of a dual-career couple.

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,696
So you get this well-meaning couple

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,976
who tells you straight out
at a family gathering

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,256
or at a friends gathering,

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,709
that, come on, you must know
you're not a great mom,

107
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,293
given how much you're investing
in your career, right?

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,416
I would lie if I said
these words didn't hurt.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,896
My children are the most
precious thing to me,

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,600
and the thought that I could be
failing them in any way is intolerable.

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,016
But just like I did with John,

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,656
I quickly reminded myself
that these were their issues,

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,880
their complexes.

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,816
So instead of replying,

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,136
I gave back one of my largest smiles

116
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,016
as I saw, in flashing light,

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,176
the following sign in my mind's eye.

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,256
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

119
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
(Applause)

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,096
You see, as a young woman
in these situations, you have two options.

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,976
You can either decide
to internalize these negative messages

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,616
that are being thrown at you,

123
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,616
to let them make you feel like a failure,

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,216
like success is way too hard
to ever achieve,

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,656
or you can choose to see that others'
negativity is their own issue,

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,720
and instead transform it
into your own personal fuel.

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,056
I have learned
to always go for option two,

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,200
and I have found that it has taken me
from strength to strength.

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,256
And it's true what they say:

130
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
success is the best revenge.

131
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,376
Some women in the Middle East

132
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,816
are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,296
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"

134
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,696
because who you marry is your own choice,

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,320
and you'd better marry someone supportive
if you plan to have a long career.

136
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,536
Still today, the Arab man
is not an equal contributor in the home.

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,776
It's simply not expected by our society,

138
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,240
and even frowned upon as not very manly.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,056
As for the Arab woman,
our society still assumes

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,816
that her primary source of happiness
should be the happiness and prosperity

141
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,776
of her children and husband.

142
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,240
She mostly exists for her family.

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,736
Things are changing,
but it will take time.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,256
For now, it means
that the professional Arab woman

145
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,616
has to somehow maintain the perfect home,

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,736
make sure that her children's every need
is being taken care of

147
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
and manage her demanding career.

148
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,096
To achieve this, I have found the hard way

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,896
that you need to apply your hard-earned
professional skills to your personal life.

150
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
You need to work your life.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
Here is how I do this in my personal life.

152
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,856
One thing to know about the Middle East

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,320
is that nearly every family
has access to affordable domestic help.

154
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,320
The challenge therefore becomes
how to recruit effectively.

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,456
Just like I would in my business life,
I have based the selection

156
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,536
of who would support me
with my children while I'm at work

157
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
on a strong referral.

158
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,216
Cristina had worked
for four years with my sister

159
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,560
and the quality of her work
was well-established.

160
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,136
She is now an integral
member of our family,

161
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,760
having been with us
since Alia was six months old.

162
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,895
She makes sure that the house
is running smoothly while I'm at work,

163
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,135
and I make sure to empower her

164
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,336
in the most optimal conditions
for her and my children,

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,559
just like I would my best talent at work.

166
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,136
This lesson applies
whatever your childcare situation,

167
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,576
whether an au pair, nursery,

168
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,936
part-time nanny
that you share with someone else.

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,800
Choose very carefully, and empower.

170
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,376
If you look at my calendar,

171
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,376
you will see every working day

172
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,096
one and a half hours
from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time

173
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
blocked and called "family time."

174
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,336
This is sacred time.

175
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,760
I have done this
ever since Alia was a baby.

176
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,456
I do everything in my power
to protect this time

177
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,896
so that I can be home by then
to spend quality time with my children,

178
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,320
asking them about their day,

179
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,256
checking up on homework,
reading them a bedtime story

180
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,856
and giving them
lots of kisses and cuddles.

181
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,376
If I'm traveling,
in whatever the time zone,

182
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,880
I use Skype to connect with my children
even if I am miles away.

183
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,256
Our son Burhan is five years old,

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,840
and he's learning to read
and do basic maths.

185
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,496
Here's another confession:

186
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,256
I have found that our daughter
is actually more successful

187
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,176
at teaching him these skills than I am.

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,920
(Laughter)

189
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,856
It started as a game, but Alia loves
playing teacher to her little brother,

190
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,056
and I have found that these sessions
actually improve Burhan's literacy,

191
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,456
increase Alia's sense of responsibility,

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,456
and strengthen the bonding between them,

193
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,760
a win-win all around.

194
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,736
The successful Arab women I know

195
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,896
have each found their unique approach
to working their life

196
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,296
as they continue to shoulder

197
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,016
the lion's share
of responsibility in the home.

198
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,656
But this is not just
about surviving in your dual role

199
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,376
as a career woman and mother.

200
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,920
This is also about being in the present.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,856
When I am with my children,

202
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,296
I try to leave work out of our lives.

203
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,336
Instead of worrying about how many minutes
I can spend with them every day,

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,136
I focus on turning these minutes
into memorable moments,

205
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,376
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

206
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,216
hearing them, connecting with them.

207
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,016
["Join forces, don't compete."]

208
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,816
Arab women of my generation
have not been very visible

209
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,936
in the public eye as they grew up.

210
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,856
This explains, I think, to some extent,

211
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,560
why you find so few women
in politics in the Arab world.

212
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,816
The upside of this, however,

213
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,936
is that we have spent a lot of time

214
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
developing a social skill
behind the scenes,

215
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,816
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

216
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,056
on the phone,

217
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,856
a social skill that is
very important to success:

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,536
networking.

219
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,216
I would say the average Arab woman

220
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,776
has a large network
of friends and acquaintances.

221
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
The majority of those are also women.

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,376
In the West, it seems like ambitious women
often compare themselves to other women

223
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,560
hoping to be noticed as the most
successful woman in the room.

224
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,136
This leads to the much-spoken-about
competitive behavior

225
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
between professional women.

226
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,736
If there's only room
for one woman at the top,

227
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,600
then you can't make room for others,
much less lift them up.

228
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,256
Arab women, generally speaking,

229
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,520
have not fallen
for this psychological trap.

230
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,216
Faced with a patriarchal society,

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,576
they have found
that by helping each other out,

232
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
all benefit.

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,296
In my previous job, I was the most
senior woman in the Middle East,

234
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,176
so one could think that investing
in my network of female colleagues

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,776
couldn't bring many benefits

236
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,056
and that I should instead invest my time

237
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,800
developing my relationships
with male seniors and peers.

238
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,320
Yet two of my biggest breaks
came through the support of other women.

239
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,656
It was the head of marketing
who initially suggested

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,976
I be considered as a young global leader
to the World Economic Forum.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,976
She was familiar with my media engagements
and my publications,

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,096
and when she was asked
to voice her opinion,

243
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,360
she highlighted my name.

244
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,936
It was a young consultant,
a Saudi lady and friend,

245
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,696
who helped me sell
my first project in Saudi Arabia,

246
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
a market I was finding hard
to gain traction in as a woman.

247
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,336
She introduced me to a client,

248
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,496
and that introduction led to the first
of very many projects for me in Saudi.

249
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,976
Today, I have two senior women on my team,

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
and I see making them successful
as key to my own success.

251
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,296
Women continue to advance in the world,

252
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,696
not fast enough, but we're moving.

253
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,816
The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.

254
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,456
Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,

255
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,800
for a total of eight female ministers.

256
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,056
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,896
and more than many
developed countries can claim.

258
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,280
This is today my daughter
Alia's favorite picture.

259
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,856
This is the result,
no doubt, of great leadership,

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,496
but it is also the result
of strong Arab women

261
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,496
not giving up and continuously
pushing the boundaries.

262
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,656
It is the result of Arab women
deciding every day like me

263
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,456
to convert shit into fuel,

264
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,016
to work their life
to keep work out of their life,

265
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,080
and to join forces and not compete.

266
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,376
As I look to the future,

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,936
my hopes for my daughter
when she stands on this stage

268
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,776
some 20, 30 years from now

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,896
are that she be as proud
to call herself her mother's daughter

270
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,160
as her father's daughter.

271
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,496
My hopes for my son

272
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,136
are that by then, the expression
"her mother's son" or "mama's boy"

273
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,560
would have taken on
a completely different meaning.

274
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,336
Thank you.

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,068
(Applause)
