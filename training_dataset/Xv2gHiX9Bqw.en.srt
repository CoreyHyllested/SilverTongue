00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:16,341
A year ago, we were invited
by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

1
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,388
to present our art projects.

2
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:23,133
We are used to invitations,
but this invitation really thrilled us.

3
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:26,427
The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.

4
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:29,419
It is the only old building
in the government district

5
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,399
that was not destroyed
during the Second World War,

6
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,191
and it sits right next
to the Federal Chancellery.

7
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:39,839
No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel
than the Swiss diplomats.

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:41,839
(Laughter)

9
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:46,475
The government district in Berlin
also contains the Reichstag --

10
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,310
Germany's parliament --
and the Brandenburg Gate,

11
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,275
and right next to the gate
there are other embassies,

12
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,696
in particular the US
and the British Embassy.

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,873
Although Germany is an advanced democracy,

14
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:02,858
citizens are limited
in their constitutional rights

15
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:04,275
in its government district.

16
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,686
The right of assembly and the right
to demonstrate are restricted there.

17
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:13,275
And this is interesting
from an artistic point of view.

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,011
The opportunities to exercise
participation and to express oneself

19
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,275
are always bound to a certain order

20
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,774
and always subject
to a specific regulation.

21
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:28,557
With an awareness of the dependencies
of these regulations,

22
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:31,275
we can gain a new perspective.

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,953
The given terms and conditions
shape our perception, our actions

24
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,564
and our lives.

25
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:41,275
And this is crucial in another context.

26
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,777
Over the last couple of years,

27
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:47,275
we learned that from the roofs
of the US and the British Embassy,

28
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,036
the secret services have been listening
to the entire district,

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,756
including the mobile phone
of Angela Merkel.

30
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,275
The antennas of the British GCHQ are
hidden in a white cylindrical radome,

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,316
while the listening post
of the American NSA

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,299
is covered by radio transparent screens.

33
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:10,275
But how to address these hidden
and disguised forces?

34
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,275
With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,

35
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,902
we accepted the invitation
of the Swiss Embassy.

36
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:20,886
And we used this opportunity
to exploit the specific situation.

37
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,650
If people are spying on us,
it stands to reason

38
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:28,275
that they have to listen
to what we are saying.

39
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,275
(Laughter)

40
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,299
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,
we installed a series of antennas.

41
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,983
They weren't as sophisticated as those
used by the Americans and the British.

42
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,274
(Laughter)

43
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,021
They were makeshift can antennas,

44
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:49,034
not camouflaged but totally
obvious and visible.

45
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,794
The Academy of Arts joined the project,

46
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:56,508
and so we built another
large antenna on their rooftop,

47
00:02:56,532 --> 00:03:00,550
exactly between the listening posts
of the NSA and the GCHQ.

48
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,430
(Laughter)

49
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:07,275
Never have we been observed in such detail
while building an art installation.

50
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,551
A helicopter circled over our heads

51
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,805
with a camera registering
each and every move we made,

52
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,039
and on the roof of the US Embassy,
security officers patrolled.

53
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:22,688
Although the government district
is governed by a strict police order,

54
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:26,871
there are no specific laws
relating to digital communication.

55
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:31,031
Our installation
was therefore perfectly legal,

56
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:34,252
and the Swiss Ambassador
informed Chancellor Merkel about it.

57
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,980
We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"

58
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,980
(Laughter)

59
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:45,066
The antennas created an open
and free Wi-Fi communication network

60
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,275
in which anyone who wanted to
would be able to participate

61
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,411
using any Wi-Fi-enabled device
without any hindrance,

62
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,356
and be able to send messages

63
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,460
to those listening on the frequencies
that were being intercepted.

64
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,005
Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --

65
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:03,678
anything could be sent anonymously.

66
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,275
And people did communicate.

67
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,275
Over 15,000 messages were sent.

68
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,051
Here are some examples.

69
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,811
"Hello world, hello Berlin,
hello NSA, hello GCHQ."

70
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,299
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!
Blow the whistle!"

71
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:28,588
"This is the NSA. In God we trust.
All others we track!!!!!"

72
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,864
(Laughter)

73
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:36,275
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -
we are part of your organizations.

74
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,299
# expect us. We will #shutdown"

75
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:42,943
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel.
Open Networks."

76
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:47,705
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself
will you tell your grandchildren?"

77
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,870
"@NSA My neighbors are noisy.
Please send a drone strike."

78
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:55,346
(Laughter)

79
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,840
"Make Love, Not cyberwar."

80
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,275
We invited the embassies
and the government departments

81
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:05,105
to participate in the open network, too,

82
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,042
and to our surprise, they did.

83
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,986
Files appeared on the network,
including classified documents

84
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,628
leaked from the parliamentary
investigation commission,

85
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:16,342
which highlights that the free exchange
and discussion of vital information

86
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:20,706
is starting to become difficult,
even for members of a parliament.

87
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:25,068
We also organized guided tours
to experience and sound out

88
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,142
the power constellations on-site.

89
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,503
The tours visited the restricted zones
around the embassies,

90
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:34,926
and we discussed the potential
and the highlights of communication.

91
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:40,478
If we become aware of the constellation,

92
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:43,298
the terms and conditions of communication,

93
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:45,653
it not only broadens our horizon,

94
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:49,549
it allows us to look behind
the regulations that limit our worldview,

95
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:53,699
our specific social, political
or aesthetic conventions.

96
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,414
Let's look at an actual example.

97
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,470
The fate of people living
in the makeshift settlements

98
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,221
on the outskirts of Paris

99
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,409
is hidden and faded from view.

100
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,758
It's a vicious circle.

101
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,551
It's not poverty, not racism,
not exclusion that are new.

102
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:14,093
What is new is how
these realities are hidden

103
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,745
and how people are made invisible

104
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:19,865
in an age of global and overwhelming
communication and exchange.

105
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,430
Such makeshift settlements
are considered illegal,

106
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:26,726
and therefore those living in them
don't have a chance

107
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,551
of making their voices heard.

108
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:34,001
On the contrary, every time they appear,
every time they risk becoming visible,

109
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,735
merely gives grounds
for further persecution,

110
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,768
expulsion and suppression.

111
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:43,996
What interested us was how we could
come to know this hidden side.

112
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,409
We were searching for an interface
and we found one.

113
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:51,696
It's not a digital interface,
but a physical one: it's a hotel.

114
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,235
We named the project "Hotel Gelem."

115
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,616
Together with Roma families,
we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,

116
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,599
for example, in Freiburg in Germany,
in Montreuil near Paris,

117
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,275
and also in the Balkans.

118
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,660
These are real hotels.

119
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,275
People can stay there.

120
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:08,275
But they aren't a commercial enterprise.

121
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:09,781
They are a symbol.

122
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:14,227
You can go online and ask
for a personal invitation

123
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:18,637
to come and live for a few days
in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,

124
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:22,153
eating, working and living
with the Roma families.

125
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:25,915
Here, the Roma families
are not the travelers;

126
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,234
the visitors are.

127
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:30,639
Here, the Roma families
are not a minority;

128
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:31,957
the visitors are.

129
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,802
The point is not to make judgments,

130
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,580
but rather to find out
about the context that determines

131
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:43,803
these disparate and seemingly
insurmountable contradictions.

132
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,539
In the world of globalization,

133
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,275
the continents are drifting
closer to each other.

134
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,823
Cultures, goods and people
are in permanent exchange,

135
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,101
but at the same time, the gap
between the world of the privileged

136
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,973
and the world of the excluded is growing.

137
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,275
We were recently in Australia.

138
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,900
For us, it was no problem
to enter the country.

139
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,606
We have European passports,
visas and air tickets.

140
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,761
But asylum seekers who arrive
by boat in Australia

141
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:12,821
are deported or taken to prison.

142
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,774
The interception of the boats

143
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:17,879
and the disappearance of the people
into the detention system

144
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:20,546
are veiled by the Australian authorities.

145
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:25,006
These procedures are declared
to be secret military operations.

146
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,912
After dramatic escapes
from crisis zones and war zones,

147
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:33,047
men, women and children
are detained by Australia without trial,

148
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:35,044
sometimes for years.

149
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,132
During our stay, however,

150
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:43,275
we managed to reach out and work
with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,

151
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,501
despite strict screening and isolation.

152
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:50,166
From these contexts was born
an installation in the art space

153
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,275
of the Queensland University
of Technology in Brisbane.

154
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,690
On the face of it,
it was a very simple installation.

155
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:01,587
On the floor, a stylized compass
gave the direction

156
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,619
to each immigration detention center,

157
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:08,275
accompanied by the distance
and the name of the immigration facility.

158
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,275
But the exhibition step
came in the form of connectivity.

159
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:16,275
Above every floor marking,
there was a headset.

160
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,915
Visitors were offered the opportunity
to talk directly to a refugee

161
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,275
who was or had been imprisoned

162
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,487
in a specific detention facility

163
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,932
and engage in a personal conversation.

164
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,782
In the protected context
of the art exhibition,

165
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,433
asylum seekers felt free
to talk about themselves,

166
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:38,147
their story and their situation,
without fear of consequences.

167
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,706
Visitors immersed themselves
in long conversations

168
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,483
about families torn apart,
about dramatic escapes from war zones,

169
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,119
about suicide attempts,

170
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:49,753
about the fate of children in detention.

171
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:52,602
Emotions ran deep. Many wept.

172
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,008
Several revisited the exhibition.

173
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,372
It was a powerful experience.

174
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,731
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.

175
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:07,275
The situation for the asylum seekers
is made worse by contradictory policies

176
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,594
and the temptation
of militarized responses.

177
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:13,989
We have also established
communication systems

178
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,081
in remote refugee centers
in Switzerland and Greece.

179
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,853
They are all about providing
basic information -- weather forecasts,

180
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,751
legal information, guidance.

181
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,854
But they are significant.

182
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:26,529
Information on the Internet

183
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:29,283
that could ensure survival
along dangerous routes

184
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,700
is being censored,

185
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:35,411
and the provision of such information
is becoming increasingly criminalized.

186
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,651
This brings us back to our network
and to the antennas

187
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,905
on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

188
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,003
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.

189
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,935
We should not take it for granted
to be boundlessly connected.

190
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,992
We should start making
our own connections,

191
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,516
fighting for this idea of an equal
and globally interconnected world.

192
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,275
This is essential to overcome
our speechlessness

193
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,419
and the separation provoked
by rival political forces.

194
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,030
It is only in truly exposing ourselves

195
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,920
to the transformative power
of this experience

196
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:10,275
that we can overcome
prejudice and exclusion.

197
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,453
Thank you.

198
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:16,811
(Applause)

199
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:18,522
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.

200
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,871
The other half of your
artistic duo is also here.

201
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:22,532
Christoph Wachter, come onstage.

202
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:27,914
(Applause)

203
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,343
First, tell me just a detail:

204
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,446
the name of the hotel
is not a random name.

205
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,731
Gelem means something specific
in the Roma language.

206
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:39,573
Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem"
is the title of the Romani hymn,

207
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,275
the official, and it means
"I went a long way."

208
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,199
BG: That's just to add
the detail to your talk.

209
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:47,907
But you two traveled
to the island of Lesbos

210
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,622
very recently, you're just back
a couple of days ago,

211
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:53,054
in Greece, where thousands
of refugees are arriving

212
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,366
and have been arriving
over the last few months.

213
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,832
What did you see there
and what did you do there?

214
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:01,657
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one
of the Greek islands close to Turkey,

215
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,076
and during our stay,

216
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,521
many asylum seekers arrived by boat
on overcrowded dinghies,

217
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:12,204
and after landing, they were left
completely on their own.

218
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:16,019
They are denied many services.

219
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:18,537
For example, they are not allowed
to buy a bus ticket

220
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:19,966
or to rent a hotel room,

221
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,676
so many families literally
sleep in the streets.

222
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,336
And we installed networks there
to allow basic communication,

223
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,463
because I think, I believe,

224
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:36,926
it's not only that we have to speak
about the refugees,

225
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,275
I think we need to start talking to them.

226
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:44,275
And by doing so, we can realize
that it is about human beings,

227
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,062
about their lives
and their struggle to survive.

228
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:48,996
BG: And allow them to talk as well.

229
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,935
Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.

230
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,977
Mathias, thank you for coming to TED
and sharing your story.

231
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:56,132
(Applause)
