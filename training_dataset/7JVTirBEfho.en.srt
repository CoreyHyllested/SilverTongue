0
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,144
A question I'm often asked is,

1
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:25,975
where did I get my passion
for human rights and justice?

2
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:27,842
It started early.

3
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,792
I grew up in the west of Ireland,

4
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,877
wedged between four brothers,

5
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:35,298
two older than me and two younger than me.

6
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:38,906
So of course I had to be
interested in human rights,

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,435
and equality and justice,

8
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,180
and using my elbows!

9
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:45,017
(Laughter)

10
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,030
And those issues stayed
with me and guided me,

11
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:49,680
and in particular,

12
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:54,254
when I was elected the first
woman President of Ireland,

13
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,174
from 1990 to 1997.

14
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,056
I dedicated my presidency

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,537
to having a space for those who felt
marginalized on the island of Ireland,

16
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,290
and bringing together communities
from Northern Ireland

17
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,054
with those from the Republic,

18
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,028
trying to build peace.

19
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:17,715
And I went as the first Irish president
to the United Kingdom

20
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,725
and met with Queen Elizabeth II,

21
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:24,557
and also welcomed to my
official residence --

22
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:28,360
which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin,"
the house of the president --

23
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,630
members of the royal family,

24
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:33,434
including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

25
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:40,308
And I was aware that at the time
of my presidency,

26
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:45,304
Ireland was a country beginning
a rapid economic progress.

27
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:52,540
We were a country that was benefiting
from the solidarity of the European Union.

28
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:58,611
Indeed, when Ireland first joined
the European Union in 1973,

29
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,991
there were parts of the country
that were considered developing,

30
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,495
including my own beloved
native county, County Mayo.

31
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,874
I led trade delegations
here to the United States,

32
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,784
to Japan, to India,

33
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:17,074
to encourage investment,
to help to create jobs,

34
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,424
to build up our economy,

35
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:20,742
to build up our health system,
our education --

36
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,107
our development.

37
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,976
What I didn't have to do as president

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,641
was buy land on mainland Europe,

39
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:36,901
so that Irish citizens could go there
because our island was going underwater.

40
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,341
What I didn't have to think about,

41
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,040
either as president
or as a constitutional lawyer,

42
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:45,716
was the implications
for the sovereignty of the territory

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,333
because of the impact of climate change.

44
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:54,080
But that is what President Tong,
of the Republic of Kiribati,

45
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,855
has to wake up every morning
thinking about.

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,728
He has bought land in Fiji
as an insurance policy,

47
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:05,748
what he calls, "migration with dignity,"

48
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:11,101
because he knows that his people
may have to leave their islands.

49
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:17,383
As I listened to President Tong
describing the situation,

50
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:23,778
I really felt that this was a problem
that no leader should have to face.

51
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:29,960
And as I heard him speak
about the pain of his problems,

52
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,380
I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.

53
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:38,079
I thought about her
and those who worked with her

54
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:43,181
on the Commission on Human Rights,
which she chaired in 1948,

55
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:47,217
and drew up the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

56
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:51,614
For them, it would have been unimaginable

57
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:56,272
that a whole country
could go out of existence

58
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,717
because of human-induced climate change.

59
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,490
I came to climate change not as
a scientist or an environmental lawyer,

60
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:08,473
and I wasn't really impressed
by the images of polar bears

61
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,107
or melting glaciers.

62
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,655
It was because of the impact on people,

63
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,077
and the impact on their rights --

64
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:22,232
their rights to food and safe water,
health, education and shelter.

65
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:26,633
And I say this with humility,

66
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:30,592
because I came late
to the issue of climate change.

67
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,045
When I served

68
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,069
as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

69
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:37,323
from 1997 to 2002,

70
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,553
climate change wasn't
at the front of my mind.

71
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:43,474
I don't remember making
a single speech on climate change.

72
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:46,801
I knew that there was another
part of the United Nations --

73
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,983
the UN Convention on Climate Change --

74
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:52,728
that was dealing with
the issue of climate change.

75
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:57,112
It was later when I started
to work in African countries

76
00:04:57,136 --> 00:05:00,404
on issues of development and human rights.

77
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:03,690
And I kept hearing
this pervasive sentence:

78
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:08,065
"Oh, but things are so much worse now,
things are so much worse."

79
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:11,868
And then I explored what was behind that;

80
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:15,201
it was about changes in the climate --

81
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:18,145
climate shocks, changes in the weather.

82
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,887
I met Constance Okollet,

83
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:24,069
who had formed a women's group
in Eastern Uganda,

84
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,720
and she told me that
when she was growing up,

85
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,077
she had a very normal life in her village
and they didn't go hungry,

86
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:36,430
they knew that the seasons would come
as they were predicted to come,

87
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:39,231
they knew when to sow
and they knew when to harvest,

88
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,627
and so they had enough food.

89
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,333
But, in recent years,

90
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,281
at the time of this conversation,

91
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,535
they had nothing
but long periods of drought,

92
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,210
and then flash flooding,

93
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,955
and then more drought.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,821
The school had been destroyed,

95
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,384
livelihoods had been destroyed,

96
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,182
their harvest had been destroyed.

97
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:02,812
She forms this women's group
to try to keep her community together.

98
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:08,329
And this was a reality
that really struck me,

99
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:12,738
because of course,
Constance Okollet wasn't responsible

100
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,428
for the greenhouse gas emissions
that were causing this problem.

101
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,951
Indeed, I was very struck
about the situation in Malawi

102
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,857
in January of this year.

103
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,008
There was an unprecedented
flooding in the country,

104
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,414
it covered about a third of the country,

105
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,604
over 300 people were killed,

106
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,921
and hundreds of thousands
lost their livelihoods.

107
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:37,484
And the average person in Malawi

108
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:42,451
emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.

109
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:48,690
The average US citizen emits
about 17,5 metric tons.

110
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:52,817
So those who are suffering
disproportionately

111
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:59,682
don't drive cars, don't have electricity,
don't consume very significantly,

112
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:02,864
and yet they are feeling more and more

113
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:07,277
the impacts of the changes in the climate,

114
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,570
the changes that are preventing them
from knowing how to grow food properly,

115
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:15,213
and knowing how
to look after their future.

116
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:22,514
I think it was really
the importance of the injustice

117
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,037
that really struck me very forcibly.

118
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:33,061
And I know that we're not able
to address some of that injustice

119
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:36,603
because we're not on course
for a safe world.

120
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:43,016
Governments around the world agreed
at the conference in Copenhagen,

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,754
and have repeated it
at every conference on climate,

122
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:50,238
that we have to stay
below two degrees Celsius

123
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,649
of warming above pre-Industrial standards.

124
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,585
But we're on course
for about four degrees.

125
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:01,482
So we face an existential threat
to the future of our planet.

126
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,126
And that made me realize

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,233
that climate change is the greatest threat
to human rights in the 21st century.

128
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,201
And that brought me then
to climate justice.

129
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:17,384
Climate justice responds
to the moral argument --

130
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,440
both sides of the moral argument --

131
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,882
to address climate change.

132
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:23,057
First of all,

133
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,945
to be on the side of those who are
suffering most and are most effected.

134
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,651
And secondly,

135
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,676
to make sure that they're not left behind
again, when we start to move

136
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,509
and start to address climate change
with climate action,

137
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,055
as we are doing.

138
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,628
In our very unequal world today,

139
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:46,231
it's very striking how many
people are left behind.

140
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:52,937
In our world of 7,2 billion people,
about 3 billion are left behind.

141
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:57,675
1,3 billion don't have access
to electricity,

142
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,203
and they light their homes
with kerosene and candles,

143
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,902
both of which are dangerous.

144
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:09,417
And in fact they spend a lot of their
tiny income on that form of lighting.

145
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:13,294
2,6 billion people cook on open fires --

146
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:17,303
on coal, wood and animal dung.

147
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:22,001
And this causes
about 4 million deaths a year

148
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,247
from indoor smoke inhalation,

149
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,181
and of course, most of those
who die are women.

150
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:32,633
So we have a very unequal world,

151
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:39,101
and we need to change
from "business as usual."

152
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:45,189
And we shouldn't underestimate
the scale and the transformative nature

153
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:47,950
of the change which will be needed,

154
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:54,563
because we have to go to zero
carbon emissions by about 2050,

155
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:58,952
if we're going to stay below
two degrees Celsius of warming.

156
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:03,976
And that means we have to leave
about two-thirds of the known resources

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,207
of fossil fuels in the ground.

158
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,287
It's a very big change,

159
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,843
and it means that obviously,

160
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,509
industrialized countries
must cut their emissions,

161
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,604
must become much more energy-efficient,

162
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:19,564
and must move as quickly as possible
to renewable energy.

163
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,579
For developing countries
and emerging economies,

164
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:29,160
the problem and the challenge
is to grow without emissions,

165
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:32,498
because they must develop;
they have very poor populations.

166
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:38,282
So they must develop without emissions,
and that is a different kind of problem.

167
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,605
Indeed, no country in the world
has actually grown without emissions.

168
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,536
All the countries have developed
with fossil fuels,

169
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,858
and then may be moving
to renewable energy.

170
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,221
So it is a very big challenge,

171
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:55,955
and it requires the total support
of the international community,

172
00:10:55,979 --> 00:11:00,915
with the necessary finance and technology,
and systems and support,

173
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:07,701
because no country can make itself safe
from the dangers of climate change.

174
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:12,655
This is an issue that requires
complete human solidarity.

175
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,643
Human solidarity, if you like,
based on self-interest --

176
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,947
because we are all in this together,

177
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,366
and we have to work together

178
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,780
to ensure that we reach
zero carbon by 2050.

179
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,438
The good news is that change is happening,

180
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:31,366
and it's happening very fast.

181
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,405
Here in California,

182
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,435
there's a very ambitious
emissions target to cut emissions.

183
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:40,771
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation

184
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:45,421
to have 100 percent
renewable energy by 2045.

185
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:49,381
And governments are very ambitious
around the world.

186
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:54,398
In Costa Rica, they have committed
to being carbon-neutral by 2021.

187
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,178
In Ethiopia, the commitment
is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.

188
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:08,136
Apple have pledged that their factories
in China will use renewable energy.

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,293
And there is a race on at the moment

190
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:15,254
to convert electricity
from tidal and wave power,

191
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,497
in order that we can leave
the coal in the ground.

192
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:24,344
And that change is both welcome
and is happening very rapidly.

193
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,753
But it's still not enough,

194
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,044
and the political will
is still not enough.

195
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:33,442
Let me come back to President Tong
and his people in Kiribati.

196
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:40,868
They actually could be able to live
on their island and have a solution,

197
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:43,113
but it would take a lot of political will.

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,748
President Tong told me
about his ambitious idea

199
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:54,132
to either build up or even float
the little islands where his people live.

200
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:59,084
This, of course, is beyond
the resources of Kiribati itself.

201
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:03,156
It would require great solidarity
and support from other countries,

202
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,402
and it would require
the kind of imaginative idea

203
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:11,979
that we bring together when we want
to have a space station in the air.

204
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:17,291
But wouldn't it be wonderful
to have this engineering wonder

205
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,848
and to allow a people to remain
in their sovereign territory,

206
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,991
and be part of the community of nations?

207
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:28,798
That is the kind of idea
that we should be thinking about.

208
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:34,455
Yes, the challenges
of the transformation we need are big,

209
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,027
but they can be solved.

210
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:39,082
We are actually, as a people,

211
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:42,400
very capable of coming together
to solve problems.

212
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:46,440
I was very conscious of this
as I took part this year

213
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:50,221
in commemoration of the 70th anniversary

214
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:54,910
of the end of the Second
World War in 1945.

215
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:58,345
1945 was an extraordinary year.

216
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,973
It was a year when the world faced

217
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:05,524
what must have seemed almost
insoluble problems --

218
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:10,097
the devastation of the world wars,
particularly the Second World War;

219
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,328
the fragile peace that had
been brought about;

220
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,986
the need for a whole
economic regeneration.

221
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:20,868
But the leaders of that time
didn't flinch from this.

222
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:25,222
They had the capacity, they had
a sense of being driven by

223
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:29,297
never again must the world
have this kind of problem.

224
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:33,037
And they had to build structures
for peace and security.

225
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:36,522
And what did we get?
What did they achieve?

226
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:39,165
The Charter of the United Nations,

227
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:42,740
the Bretton Woods institutions,
as they're called, The World Bank,

228
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:45,201
and the International Monetary Fund.

229
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:48,599
A Marshall Plan for Europe,
a devastated Europe,

230
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:50,545
to reconstruct it.

231
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,630
And indeed a few years later,

232
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:55,807
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

233
00:14:56,364 --> 00:15:01,978
2015 is a year that is similar
in its importance

234
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:06,853
to 1945, with similar challenges
and similar potential.

235
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:10,400
There will be two big summits this year:

236
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,203
the first one, in September in New York,

237
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:16,512
is the summit for the sustainable
development goals.

238
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:22,549
And then the summit in Paris in December,
to give us a climate agreement.

239
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:29,692
The sustainable development goals
are intended to help countries

240
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:33,826
to live sustainably,
in tune with Mother Earth,

241
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,176
not to take out of Mother Earth
and destroy ecosystems,

242
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,814
but rather, to live in harmony
with Mother Earth,

243
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:46,667
by living under sustainable development.

244
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:49,064
And the sustainable development goals

245
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,473
will come into operation for all countries

246
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,369
on January 1, 2016.

247
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:55,991
The climate agreement --

248
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,531
a binding climate agreement --

249
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:01,219
is needed because
of the scientific evidence

250
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:04,160
that we're on a trajectory
for about a four-degree world

251
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,672
and we have to change course
to stay below two degrees.

252
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:13,557
So we need to take steps
that will be monitored and reviewed,

253
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:17,979
so that we can keep increasing
the ambition of how we cut emissions,

254
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:21,119
and how we move more rapidly
to renewable energy,

255
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:24,146
so that we have a safe world.

256
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:33,848
The reality is that this issue
is much too important

257
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:37,435
to be left to politicians
and to the United Nations.

258
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,460
(Laughter)

259
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,062
It's an issue for all of us,

260
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:44,050
and it's an issue where we need
more and more momentum.

261
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:48,396
Indeed, the face of
the environmentalist has changed,

262
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,729
because of the justice dimension.

263
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:53,973
It's now an issue
for faith-based organizations,

264
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:57,169
under very good leadership
from Pope Francis,

265
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,965
and indeed, the Church of England,

266
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,432
which is divesting from fossil fuels.

267
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:05,214
It's an issue for the business community,

268
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:06,642
and the good news is

269
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,576
that the business community
is changing very rapidly --

270
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,785
except for the fossil fuel industries --

271
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,404
(Laughter)

272
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,724
Even they are beginning
to slightly change their language --

273
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:17,729
but only slightly.

274
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:22,444
But business is not only moving rapidly
to the benefits of renewable energy,

275
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:25,191
but is urging politicians
to give them more signals,

276
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,190
so that they can move even more rapidly.

277
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,215
It's an issue for the trade
union movement.

278
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,262
It's an issue for the women's movement.

279
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:33,364
It's an issue for young people.

280
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:39,190
I was very struck when I learned
that Jibreel Khazan,

281
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:44,858
one of the Greensboro Four who had
taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,

282
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,396
said quite recently that

283
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,422
climate change is the lunch counter
moment for young people.

284
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,734
So, lunch counter moment
for young people of the 21st century --

285
00:17:56,758 --> 00:18:01,099
the sort of real human rights issue
of the 21st century,

286
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,893
because he said it is
the greatest challenge

287
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,509
to humanity and justice in our world.

288
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:12,497
I recall very much
the Climate March last September,

289
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:14,322
and that was a huge momentum,

290
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:17,308
not just in New York,
but all around the world.

291
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,602
and we have to build on that.

292
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:22,737
I was marching with some
of The Elders family,

293
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:27,788
and I saw a placard
a little bit away from me,

294
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,766
but we were wedged so closely together --

295
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,465
because after all, there were 400,000
people out in the streets of New York --

296
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,402
so I couldn't quite get to that placard,

297
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:38,507
I would have just liked to have been
able to step behind it,

298
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,977
because it said, "Angry Grannies!"

299
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,324
(Laughter)

300
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:43,802
That's what I felt.

301
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:47,799
And I have five grandchildren now,

302
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:52,111
I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother
to have five grandchildren,

303
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:55,178
and I think about their world,

304
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,363
and what it will be
like when they will share that world

305
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,433
with about 9 billion other people in 2050.

306
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:08,229
We know that inevitably it will
be a climate-constrained world,

307
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:11,102
because of the emissions
we've already put up there,

308
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:16,523
but it could be a world that is much
more equal and much fairer,

309
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:19,129
and much better for health,
and better for jobs

310
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,125
and better for energy security,

311
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:22,976
than the world we have now,

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
if we have switched sufficiently
and early enough to renewable energy,

313
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,654
and no one is left behind.

314
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:35,073
No one is left behind.

315
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:39,316
And just as we've been
looking back this year --

316
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,847
in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --

317
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:47,435
I would like to think
that they will look back,

318
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:52,308
that world will look back
35 years from 2050,

319
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:55,206
35 years to 2015,

320
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,048
and that they will say,

321
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:02,179
"Weren't they good
to do what they did in 2015?

322
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:07,678
We really appreciate that they took
the decisions that made a difference,

323
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:10,640
and that put the world
on the right pathway,

324
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:13,370
and we benefit now from that pathway,"

325
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:17,275
that they will feel that somehow
we took our responsibilities,

326
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,458
we did what was done
in 1945 in similar terms,

327
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,903
we didn't miss the opportunity,

328
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:26,109
we lived up to our responsibilities.

329
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,305
That's what this year is about.

330
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,038
And somehow for me,

331
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:35,356
it's captured in words of somebody
that I admired very much.

332
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,713
She was a mentor of mine,
she was a friend,

333
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,685
she died much too young,

334
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,714
she was an extraordinary personality,

335
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:44,222
a great champion of the environment:

336
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,070
Wangari Maathai.

337
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,253
Wangari said once,

338
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,231
"In the course of history,

339
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,266
there comes a time
when humanity is called upon

340
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,041
to shift to a new level of consciousness,

341
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:03,522
to reach a higher moral ground."

342
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:06,054
And that's what we have to do.

343
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:09,366
We have to reach
a new level of consciousness,

344
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,357
a higher moral ground.

345
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,632
And we have to do it this year
in those two big summits.

346
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,706
And that won't happen unless
we have the momentum

347
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,877
from people around the world who say:

348
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,421
"We want action now,

349
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,016
we want to change course,

350
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,413
we want a safe world,

351
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,612
a safe world for future generations,

352
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:32,244
a safe world for our children
and our grandchildren,

353
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,539
and we're all in this together."

354
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:35,723
Thank you.

355
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:40,992
(Applause)
