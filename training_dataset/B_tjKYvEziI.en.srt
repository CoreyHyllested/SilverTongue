0
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:18,317
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?

1
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,237
There's still some confusion
about that question,

2
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,871
as this is a fairly new field of research.

3
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:28,928
For example, I was talking
to one of my colleagues, Robert,

4
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:30,260
who is an oncologist,

5
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:31,585
and he was telling me,

6
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:33,769
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.

7
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:38,107
Some of my patients that have been told
they are cured of their cancer

8
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,528
still develop symptoms of depression."

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,815
And I responded to him,

10
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,179
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.

11
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:49,741
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying

12
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:54,868
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,606
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,812
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

15
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:03,408
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

16
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:08,209
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."

17
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:13,924
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.

18
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,138
[Neurogenesis]

19
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:18,932
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

20
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:23,581
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --

21
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:27,344
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.

22
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:33,587
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,

23
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,310
wanted to come to my lab

24
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,158
to understand the topic
a little bit better.

25
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,136
And I took him for a tour

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,073
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain

27
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:46,270
when it comes to neurogenesis --

28
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:48,382
and this is the hippocampus.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,932
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.

30
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,035
And what we've known already
for very long,

31
00:01:56,059 --> 00:02:00,824
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.

32
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:04,390
However, what we
have learned more recently

33
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:09,072
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain

34
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,746
where new neurons can be generated.

35
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,716
And if we slice through the hippocampus

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,008
and zoom in,

37
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:18,833
what you actually see here in blue

38
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:23,430
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.

39
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,824
So when it comes to the human brain --

40
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,380
my colleague Jonas FrisÃ©n
from the Karolinska Institutet,

41
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:37,144
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day

42
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:38,366
in the hippocampus.

43
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:40,858
You might think this is not much,

44
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,271
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.

45
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:46,715
But by the time we turn 50,

46
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,415
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure

47
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,654
with adult-born neurons.

48
00:02:55,248 --> 00:03:00,284
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?

49
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:05,022
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.

50
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,563
And in the lab we have shown

51
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,823
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain

52
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:12,407
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

53
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,947
then we block certain memory abilities.

54
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:22,633
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --

55
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:25,455
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.

56
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,659
We are still learning a lot,

57
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:30,746
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,

58
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,673
but also for the quality of the memory.

59
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:37,742
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory

60
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:42,448
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,552
how do you find your bike

62
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:48,092
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,

63
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:50,258
but in a slightly different position?

64
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,552
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert

65
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:59,438
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.

66
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,948
So in an animal model of depression,

67
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:05,976
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,743
And if we give antidepressants,

69
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:12,221
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,

70
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:15,388
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,

71
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:20,872
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.

72
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,500
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,

73
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:28,357
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.

74
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,477
So by then, Robert had understood

75
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:35,199
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression

76
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,818
even after being cured of their cancer,

77
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:42,223
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.

78
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:45,875
And it will take time
to generate new neurons

79
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,105
that reach normal functions.

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,189
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence

81
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:57,928
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice

82
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:01,566
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,

83
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,153
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,

84
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,311
or associated with stress.

85
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,019
So the next question is:

86
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,217
can we control neurogenesis?

87
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,257
The answer is yes.

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,423
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

89
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,382
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,

90
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:26,090
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis

91
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,280
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

92
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:29,963
Are we ready?

93
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,709
OK, let's go.

94
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,621
So what about learning?

95
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,701
Increasing?

96
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:36,884
Yes.

97
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,694
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.

98
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,034
How about stress?

99
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:48,168
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.

100
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,804
How about sleep deprivation?

101
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,074
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

102
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:55,319
How about sex?

103
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:57,566
Oh, wow!

104
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,857
(Laughter)

105
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,634
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.

106
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:04,810
However, it's all about balance here.

107
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,047
We don't want to fall in a situation --

108
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,999
(Laughter)

109
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:11,857
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.

110
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,110
(Laughter)

111
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,944
How about getting older?

112
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,328
So the neurogenesis rate
will decrease as we get older,

113
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:25,098
but it is still occurring.

114
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,233
And then finally, how about running?

115
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:32,721
I will let you judge that one by yourself.

116
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,359
So this is one of the first studies

117
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:39,786
that was carried out by one of my mentors,
Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,

118
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,084
showing that the environment
can have an impact

119
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,997
on the production of new neurons.

120
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:48,275
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

121
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,544
that had no running wheel in its cage.

122
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:54,603
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

123
00:06:55,246 --> 00:07:00,384
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

124
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,004
that had a running wheel in its cage.

125
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:04,551
So you see the massive increase

126
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,388
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.

127
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,612
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.

128
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,286
What you eat will have an effect

129
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,224
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.

130
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:22,208
So here we have a sample of diet --

131
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:25,509
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.

132
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,568
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:

133
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:33,686
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.

134
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:37,610
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --

135
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,773
will increase neurogenesis.

136
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,120
Intake of flavonoids,

137
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:44,147
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,

138
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,994
will increase neurogenesis.

139
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,861
Omega-3 fatty acids,

140
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,096
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

141
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,558
will increase the production
of these new neurons.

142
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:57,603
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat

143
00:07:57,627 --> 00:08:00,367
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.

144
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:05,414
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.

145
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:08,703
However, not everything is lost;

146
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,779
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,

147
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:15,294
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.

148
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,574
So next time you are at a dinner party,

149
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,602
you might want to reach for this possibly
"neurogenesis-neutral" drink.

150
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,042
(Laughter)

151
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,567
And then finally,
let me point out the last one --

152
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,749
a quirky one.

153
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,668
So Japanese groups are fascinated
with food textures,

154
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:36,995
and they have shown that actually
soft diet impairs neurogenesis,

155
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,740
as opposed to food that requires
mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.

156
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,620
So all of this data,

157
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,225
where we need to look
at the cellular level,

158
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:49,756
has been generated using animal models.

159
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,851
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,

160
00:08:54,875 --> 00:09:01,033
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood

161
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,541
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,

162
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:09,322
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,

163
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:14,445
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --

164
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:18,333
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,

165
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,540
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.

166
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:28,460
So we think that the effect of diet

167
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,079
on mental health, on memory and mood,

168
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:36,575
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

169
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,914
And it's not only what you eat,

170
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,003
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it

171
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:43,851
and how much of it you eat.

172
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:49,874
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --

173
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:53,563
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,

174
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:57,571
and how we can control their survival
and their production.

175
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:02,435
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

176
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,648
And on your side --

177
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,102
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.

178
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,849
Thank you.

179
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:14,832
(Applause)

180
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,188
Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.

181
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,457
Now, I told you you changed my life --

182
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,259
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

183
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:22,830
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

184
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,972
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.

185
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,520
Do I have to run?

186
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:32,010
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,

187
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,639
getting oxygen to the brain?

188
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,798
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

189
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:37,838
ST: So for the moment,

190
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:41,102
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,

191
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:46,163
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --

192
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,267
or moving the blood flow to the brain,

193
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,893
should be beneficial.

194
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,980
MH: So I don't have to get
a running wheel in my office?

195
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,167
ST: No, you don't!

196
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:57,284
MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.

197
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:59,061
Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much.

198
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:00,284
ST: Thank you, Margaret.

199
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,976
(Applause)
