0
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,738
So this is James Risen.

1
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,924
You may know him as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

2
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,640
for The New York Times.

3
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,418
Long before anybody knew
Edward Snowden's name,

4
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:25,358
Risen wrote a book in which
he famously exposed

5
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:29,318
that the NSA was illegally wiretapping
the phone calls of Americans.

6
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:31,612
But it's another chapter in that book

7
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,651
that may have an even more lasting impact.

8
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:39,223
In it, he describes a catastrophic
US intelligence operation

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,336
in which the CIA quite literally
handed over blueprints

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,146
of a nuclear bomb to Iran.

11
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:46,457
If that sounds crazy, go read it.

12
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,972
It's an incredible story.

13
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:50,520
But you know who didn't like that chapter?

14
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:52,043
The US government.

15
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:54,806
For nearly a decade afterwards,

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,083
Risen was the subject
of a US government investigation

17
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:00,476
in which prosecutors demanded
that he testify

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,404
against one of his alleged sources.

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,904
And along the way, he became the face
for the US government's recent pattern

20
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,947
of prosecuting whistleblowers
and spying on journalists.

21
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,349
You see, under the First Amendment,

22
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:16,000
the press has the right to publish
secret information in the public interest.

23
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:21,158
But it's impossible to exercise that right
if the media can't also gather that news

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:24,438
and protect the identities
of the brave men and women

25
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:25,612
who get it to them.

26
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,119
So when the government came knocking,

27
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:31,184
Risen did what many brave reporters
have done before him:

28
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,393
he refused

29
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,088
and said he'd rather go to jail.

30
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,594
So from 2007 to 2015,

31
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,412
Risen lived under the specter
of going to federal prison.

32
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:45,023
That is, until just days before the trial,
when a curious thing happened.

33
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,713
Suddenly, after years of claiming
it was vital to their case,

34
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:52,427
the government dropped their demands
to Risen altogether.

35
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,460
It turns out, in the age
of electronic surveillance,

36
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:58,372
there are very few places
reporters and sources can hide.

37
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,554
And instead of trying and failing
to have Risen testify,

38
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,625
they could have his digital trail
testify against him instead.

39
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,101
So completely in secret
and without his consent,

40
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,395
prosecutors got Risen's phone records.

41
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:16,419
They got his email records,
his financial and banking information,

42
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,196
his credit reports,

43
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,990
even travel records with a list
of flights he had taken.

44
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,593
And it was among this information that
they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,

45
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:28,736
Risen's alleged source
and CIA whistleblower.

46
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,450
Sadly, this is only one case of many.

47
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,759
President Obama ran on a promise
to protect whistleblowers,

48
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,045
and instead, his Justice Department
has prosecuted more

49
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,560
than all other administrations combined.

50
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,283
Now, you can see how this
could be a problem,

51
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:49,774
especially because the government
considers so much of what it does secret.

52
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:55,258
Since 9/11, virtually every important
story about national security

53
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:58,202
has been the result of a whistleblower
coming to a journalist.

54
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,568
So we risk seeing the press
unable to do their job

55
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:03,791
that the First Amendment
is supposed to protect

56
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,822
because of the government's
expanded ability to spy on everyone.

57
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,940
But just as technology has allowed
the government

58
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:12,671
to circumvent reporters' rights,

59
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,869
the press can also use technology

60
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,233
to protect their sources
even better than before.

61
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,810
And they can start from the moment
they begin speaking with them,

62
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,261
rather than on the witness stand
after the fact.

63
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:26,289
Communications software now exists

64
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,845
that wasn't available
when Risen was writing his book,

65
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:32,868
and is much more surveillance-resistant
than regular emails or phone calls.

66
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,007
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,

67
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,716
an open-source whistleblower
submission system

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,788
that was originally created by the late
Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

69
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:47,477
and is now developed
at the non-profit where I work,

70
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,032
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

71
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,476
Instead of sending an email,

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,541
you go to a news organization's website,

73
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,565
like this one here on The Washington Post.

74
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,953
From there, you can upload a document
or send information

75
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,406
much like you would
on any other contact form.

76
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:05,334
It'll then be encrypted
and stored on a server

77
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,906
that only the news organization
has access to.

78
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,724
So the government can no longer
secretly demand the information,

79
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,852
and much of the information
they would demand

80
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,835
wouldn't be available in the first place.

81
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,439
SecureDrop, though, is really
only a small part of the puzzle

82
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:22,410
for protecting press freedom
in the 21st century.

83
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,408
Unfortunately, governments
all over the world

84
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,932
are constantly developing
new spying techniques

85
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,360
that put us all at risk.

86
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:32,741
And it's up to us going forward
to make sure

87
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:35,265
that it's not just
the tech-savvy whistleblowers,

88
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,574
like Edward Snowden, who have
an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

89
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:44,155
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower

90
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:47,487
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

91
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,838
or the next environmental worker

92
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:53,060
sounding the alarm
about Flint's dirty water,

93
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,764
or a Wall Street insider

94
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,965
warning us of the next financial crisis.

95
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,997
After all, these tools weren't just built
to help the brave men and women

96
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,559
who expose crimes,

97
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,817
but are meant to protect
all of our rights under the Constitution.

98
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,611
Thank you.

99
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:11,944
(Applause)
