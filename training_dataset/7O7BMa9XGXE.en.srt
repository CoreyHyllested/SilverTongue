0
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:15,404
I want to talk to you about my kids.

1
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:20,391
Now, I know everyone thinks
that their kid is the most fantastic,

2
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,490
the most beautiful kid that ever lived.

3
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:24,601
But mine really are.

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,932
(Laughter)

5
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,330
I have 696 kids,

6
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:32,806
and they are the most intelligent,
inventive, innovative,

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,676
brilliant and powerful kids
that you'll ever meet.

8
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:42,086
Any student I've had the honor of teaching
in my classroom is my kid.

9
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:46,521
However, because their "real"
parents aren't rich

10
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:49,421
and, I argue, because they
are mostly of color,

11
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,951
they will seldom get to see in themselves

12
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:54,391
the awesomeness that I see in them.

13
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:57,353
Because what I see in them is myself --

14
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:00,336
or what would have been myself.

15
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,038
I am the daughter of two hardworking,

16
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:06,680
college-educated, African-American parents

17
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:09,418
who chose careers as public servants:

18
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:13,054
my father, a minister;
my mother, an educator.

19
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:16,614
Wealth was never the primary
ambition in our house.

20
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:18,737
Because of this lack of wealth,

21
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,971
we lived in a neighborhood
that lacked wealth,

22
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,838
and henceforth a school system
that lacked wealth.

23
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:28,147
Luckily, however, we struck
the educational jackpot

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,542
in a voluntary desegregation program

25
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:33,934
that buses inner-city kids --
black and brown --

26
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,612
out to suburban schools -- rich and white.

27
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:41,049
At five years old, I had to take
an hour-long bus ride

28
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,134
to a faraway place

29
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,955
to get a better education.

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:50,136
At five years old, I thought
everyone had a life just like mine.

31
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,651
I thought everyone went to school

32
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:55,034
and were the only ones
using the brown crayons

33
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:56,726
to color in their family portraits,

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,831
while everyone else was using
the peach-colored ones.

35
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:04,174
At five years old, I thought
everyone was just like me.

36
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,111
But as I got older, I started
noticing things, like:

37
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,510
How come my neighborhood friend
don't have to wake up

38
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,072
at five o'clock in the morning,

39
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,607
and go to a school that's an hour away?

40
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:18,528
How come I'm learning to play the violin

41
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:22,260
while my neighborhood friends
don't even have a music class?

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,584
Why were my neighborhood friends
learning and reading material

43
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:29,036
that I had done two to three years prior?

44
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,980
See, as I got older,

45
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:36,691
I started to have
this unlawful feeling in my belly,

46
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,623
like I was doing something
that I wasn't supposed to be doing;

47
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,358
taking something that wasn't mine;

48
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,109
receiving a gift,

49
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,571
but with someone else's name on it.

50
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:51,433
All these amazing things
that I was being exposed to

51
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:53,155
and experiencing,

52
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,454
I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.

53
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,216
I wasn't supposed to have a library,
fully equipped athletic facilities,

54
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,712
or safe fields to play in.

55
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,455
I wasn't supposed to have
theatre departments

56
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,844
with seasonal plays and concerts --

57
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:11,105
digital, visual, performing arts.

58
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:16,259
I wasn't supposed to have
fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,

59
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:19,085
school buses that brought me door-to-door,

60
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,537
freshly prepared school lunches

61
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,305
or even air conditioning.

62
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,057
These are things my kids don't get.

63
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,198
You see, as I got older,

64
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,239
while I was grateful
for this amazing opportunity

65
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,909
that I was being given,

66
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,661
there was this ever-present pang of:

67
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,629
But what about everyone else?

68
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,507
There are thousands
of other kids just like me,

69
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,267
who deserve this, too.

70
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,429
Why doesn't everyone get this?

71
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:50,793
Why is a high-quality education
only exclusive to the rich?

72
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:55,198
It was like I had some sort
of survivor's remorse.

73
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:57,954
All of my neighborhood friends
were experiencing

74
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,803
an educational train wreck

75
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:03,516
that I was saved from through a bus ride.

76
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,561
I was like an educational Moses screaming,

77
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,194
"Let my people go ...

78
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:10,055
to high-quality schools!"

79
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,496
(Laughter)

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,080
I'd seen firsthand how the other half
was being treated and educated.

81
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:19,043
I'd seen the educational promised land,

82
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:23,306
and I could not for the life of me
justify the disparity.

83
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,292
I now teach in the very same school system
from which I sought refuge.

84
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,407
I know firsthand the tools
that were given to me as a student,

85
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:39,354
and now as a teacher, I don't have
access to those same tools

86
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,942
to give my students.

87
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:46,026
There have been countless nights
when I've cried in frustration,

88
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,326
anger

89
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,741
and sorrow,

90
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:52,056
because I can't teach my kids
the way that I was taught,

91
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:56,772
because I don't have access
to the same resources or tools

92
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,686
that were used to teach me.

93
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:01,564
My kids deserve so much better.

94
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,133
We sit and we keep banging
our heads against this term:

95
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,722
"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"

96
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:11,394
Is it really that hard to understand

97
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:14,643
why these kids perform well
and these kids don't?

98
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,092
I mean, really.

99
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,931
I think we've got it all wrong.

100
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,116
I think we,

101
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,222
as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,

102
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:26,988
should flip our paradigm and our language
and call it what it really is.

103
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,135
It's not an achievement gap;

104
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,806
it's an education debt,

105
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:37,695
for all of the foregone schooling
resources that were never invested

106
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,564
in the education of the black
and brown child over time.

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,846
A little-known secret in American history

108
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,923
is that the only American institution
created specifically for people of color

109
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,280
is the American slave trade --

110
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,815
and some would argue the prison system,

111
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,065
but that's another topic
for another TED Talk.

112
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,239
(Laughter)

113
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:03,947
The public school system of this country
was built, bought and paid for

114
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:08,258
using commerce generated
from the slave trade and slave labor.

115
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:12,614
While African-Americans were enslaved
and prohibited from schooling,

116
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,797
their labor established
the very institution

117
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,509
from which they were excluded.

118
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:23,121
Ever since then, every court case,
educational policy, reform,

119
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:26,399
has been an attempt
to retrofit the design,

120
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,083
rather than just stopping
and acknowledging:

121
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:31,715
we've had it all wrong from the beginning.

122
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:37,286
An oversimplification
of American educational history.

123
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,822
All right, just bear with me.

124
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,758
Blacks were kept out -- you know,
the whole slavery thing.

125
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:45,333
With the help
of philanthropic white people,

126
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,911
they built their own schools.

127
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:49,269
Separate but equal was OK.

128
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,459
But while we all know
things were indeed separate,

129
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,139
they were in no ways equal.

130
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:59,736
Enter Brown v. the Board of Education
of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,991
legal separation of the races
is now illegal.

132
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,129
But very few people pay attention
to all of the court cases since then,

133
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:15,426
that have undone the educational
promised land for every child

134
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,414
that Brown v. Board intended.

135
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,156
Some argue that today our schools
are now more segregated

136
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,916
than they ever were before we tried
to desegregate them in the first place.

137
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:31,556
Teaching my kids about desegregation,
the Little Rock Nine,

138
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,883
the Civil Rights Movement,

139
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:36,237
is a real awkward moment in my classroom,

140
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,962
when I have to hear
the voice of a child ask,

141
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,243
"If schools were desegregated in 1954,

142
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,564
how come there are no white kids here?"

143
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:47,048
(Laughter)

144
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,428
These kids aren't dumb.

145
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,016
They know exactly what's happening,

146
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,889
and what's not.

147
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,760
They know that when it comes to schooling,

148
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,260
black lives don't matter

149
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:00,493
and they never have.

150
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:08,831
For years, I tried desperately
to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.

151
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,280
I'd amassed a modest classroom library

152
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:15,601
of books I'd accumulated
from secondhand shops,

153
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,088
thrift stores, attics -- you know.

154
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:20,572
But whenever I said those dreadful words,

155
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,792
"Take out a book and read,"

156
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,249
you'd think I'd just declared war.

157
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,966
It was torture.

158
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:28,857
One day,

159
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,314
after I'd heard about this website
called DonorsChoose,

160
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,654
where classroom teachers create wish lists

161
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,782
of items they need for their classroom

162
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:39,333
and anonymous donors fulfill them,

163
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:43,358
I figured I'd go out on a limb
and just make a wish list

164
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,595
of the teenager's dream library.

165
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:51,890
Over 200 brand-new books
were sent to my room piece by piece.

166
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:57,245
Every day there were new deliveries
and my kids would exclaim with glee,

167
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,226
"This feels like Christmas!"

168
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,330
(Laughter)

169
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:01,519
Then they'd say,

170
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:04,415
"Ms. Sumner, where did
these books come from?"

171
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:05,655
And then I'd reply,

172
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,655
"Strangers from all over the country
wanted you to have these."

173
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,951
And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,

174
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,201
"But they're brand-new."

175
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,227
(Laughter)

176
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,830
To which I'd reply,

177
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,634
"You deserve brand-new books."

178
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:25,560
The whole experience hit home
for me when one of my girls,

179
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,654
as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,

180
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:33,960
"Ms. Sumner -- you know,
I figured you bought these books,

181
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:36,722
'cause you teachers
are always buying us stuff.

182
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:41,187
But to know that a stranger,
someone I don't even know,

183
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,910
cares this much about me

184
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,935
is pretty cool."

185
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,495
Knowing that strangers
will take care of you

186
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,545
is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.

187
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,784
Ever since the donation,

188
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:57,666
there has been a steady stream of kids
signing out books to take home,

189
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,350
and then returning them
with the exclamation,

190
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,962
"This one was good!"

191
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,034
(Laughter)

192
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:05,360
Now when I say,
"Take out a book and read,"

193
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:07,603
kids rush to my library.

194
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,896
It wasn't that they didn't want to read,

195
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,470
but instead, they'd gladly read
if the resources were there.

196
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,231
Institutionally speaking,

197
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:23,607
our public school system has never
done right by the black and brown child.

198
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:26,616
We keep focusing on the end results

199
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,005
or test results,

200
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,875
and getting frustrated.

201
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,036
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,

202
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,897
"How did it get so bad?
How did we get here?"

203
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,045
Really?

204
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,514
If you neglect a child long enough,

205
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,628
you no longer have
the right to be surprised

206
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,483
when things don't turn out well.

207
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,053
Stop being perplexed

208
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:48,703
or confused

209
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,203
or befuddled

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,606
by the achievement gap,

211
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,853
the income gap,

212
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,496
the incarceration rates,

213
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,567
or whatever socioeconomic disparity
is the new "it" term for the moment.

214
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,690
The problems we have as a country

215
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,797
are the problems we created as a country.

216
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,278
The quality of your education
is directly proportionate

217
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,160
to your access to college,

218
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:13,912
your access to jobs,

219
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,644
your access to the future.

220
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,864
Until we live in a world where every kid
can get a high-quality education

221
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,424
no matter where they live,

222
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,328
or the color of their skin,

223
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,412
there are things we can do
on a macro level.

224
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,953
School funding should not
be decided by property taxes

225
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,208
or some funky economic equation

226
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:40,268
where rich kids continue
to benefit from state aid,

227
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:44,377
while poor kids are continuously
having food and resources

228
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,994
taken from their mouths.

229
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,511
Governors, senators, mayors,
city council members --

230
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,399
if we're going to call
public education public education,

231
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,006
then it should be just that.

232
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,538
Otherwise, we should
call it what it really is:

233
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,127
poverty insurance.

234
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,653
"Public education:

235
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:05,765
keeping poor kids poor since 1954."

236
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,241
(Laughter)

237
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:13,831
If we really, as a country, believe
that education is the "great equalizer,"

238
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:17,686
then it should be just that:
equal and equitable.

239
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:22,501
Until then, there's no democracy
in our democratic education.

240
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,000
On a mezzo level:

241
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,842
historically speaking, the education
of the black and brown child

242
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:32,337
has always depended
on the philanthropy of others.

243
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,155
And unfortunately, today it still does.

244
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,135
If your son or daughter or niece
or nephew or neighbor

245
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,722
or little Timmy down the street

246
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,556
goes to an affluent school,

247
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,754
challenge your school committee
to adopt an impoverished school

248
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,817
or an impoverished classroom.

249
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:53,238
Close the divide by engaging
in communication

250
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:55,459
and relationships that matter.

251
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,004
When resources are shared,

252
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,720
they're not divided;

253
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,201
they're multiplied.

254
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,710
And on a micro level:

255
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,554
if you're a human being,

256
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,151
donate.

257
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:11,587
Time, money, resources, opportunities --

258
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:13,974
whatever is in your heart.

259
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:17,051
There are websites like DonorsChoose

260
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,129
that recognize the disparity

261
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:21,648
and actually want
to do something about it.

262
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,952
What is a carpenter with no tools?

263
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,672
What is an actress with no stage?

264
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,447
What is a scientist with no laboratory?

265
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,586
What is a doctor with no equipment?

266
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,515
I'll tell you:

267
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,434
they're my kids.

268
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,035
Shouldn't they be your kids, too?

269
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,044
Thank you.

270
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:49,273
(Applause)
