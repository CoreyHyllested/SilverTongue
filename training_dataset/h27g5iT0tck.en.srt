00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:17,514
I'd like to take you on the epic quest
of the Rosetta spacecraft.

1
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:21,540
To escort and land the probe on a comet,

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,730
this has been my passion
for the past two years.

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,545
In order to do that,

4
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:30,015
I need to explain to you something
about the origin of the solar system.

5
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,238
When we go back
four and a half billion years,

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,957
there was a cloud of gas and dust.

7
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:38,484
In the center of this cloud,
our sun formed and ignited.

8
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:44,195
Along with that, what we now know
as planets, comets and asteroids formed.

9
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,608
What then happened, according to theory,

10
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:51,625
is that when the Earth had cooled down
a bit after its formation,

11
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:56,396
comets massively impacted the Earth
and delivered water to Earth.

12
00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:01,516
They probably also delivered
complex organic material to Earth,

13
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:04,906
and that may have bootstrapped
the emergence of life.

14
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:08,366
You can compare this to having
to solve a 250-piece puzzle

15
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:11,570
and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,053
Afterwards, the big planets
like Jupiter and Saturn,

17
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,631
they were not in their place
where they are now,

18
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:20,278
and they interacted gravitationally,

19
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:23,830
and they swept the whole interior
of the solar system clean,

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,432
and what we now know as comets

21
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,545
ended up in something
called the Kuiper Belt,

22
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,213
which is a belt of objects
beyond the orbit of Neptune.

23
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:34,906
And sometimes these objects
run into each other,

24
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,971
and they gravitationally deflect,

25
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:42,428
and then the gravity of Jupiter
pulls them back into the solar system.

26
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:46,120
And they then become the comets
as we see them in the sky.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,394
The important thing here to note
is that in the meantime,

28
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,693
the four and a half billion years,

29
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,875
these comets have been sitting
on the outside of the solar system,

30
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,290
and haven't changed --

31
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,193
deep, frozen versions of our solar system.

32
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,282
In the sky, they look like this.

33
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,233
We know them for their tails.

34
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,904
There are actually two tails.

35
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:08,759
One is a dust tail,
which is blown away by the solar wind.

36
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,404
The other one is an ion tail,
which is charged particles,

37
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:15,143
and they follow the magnetic field
in the solar system.

38
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,292
There's the coma,

39
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:19,199
and then there is the nucleus,
which here is too small to see,

40
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,689
and you have to remember
that in the case of Rosetta,

41
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,866
the spacecraft is in that center pixel.

42
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:27,976
We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers
away from the comet.

43
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:30,297
So what's important to remember?

44
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:35,166
Comets contain the original material
from which our solar system was formed,

45
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,526
so they're ideal to study the components

46
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:41,791
that were present at the time
when Earth, and life, started.

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,673
Comets are also suspected

48
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:47,944
of having brought the elements
which may have bootstrapped life.

49
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:52,309
In 1983, ESA set up
its long-term Horizon 2000 program,

50
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:56,233
which contained one cornerstone,
which would be a mission to a comet.

51
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:01,123
In parallel, a small mission to a comet,
what you see here, Giotto, was launched,

52
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:07,329
and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley
with an armada of other spacecraft.

53
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,900
From the results of that mission,
it became immediately clear

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,087
that comets were ideal bodies to study
to understand our solar system.

55
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:20,599
And thus, the Rosetta mission
was approved in 1993,

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,234
and originally it was supposed
to be launched in 2003,

57
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,858
but a problem arose
with an Ariane rocket.

58
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,923
However, our P.R. department,
in its enthusiasm,

59
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,145
had already made
1,000 Delft Blue plates

60
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,535
with the name of the wrong comets.

61
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:38,102
So I've never had to buy any china since.
That's the positive part.

62
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,821
(Laughter)

63
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,701
Once the whole problem was solved,

64
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,882
we left Earth in 2004

65
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,970
to the newly selected comet,
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

66
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,826
This comet had to be specially selected

67
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:53,480
because A, you have to
be able to get to it,

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,261
and B, it shouldn't have been
in the solar system too long.

69
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,208
This particular comet has been
in the solar system since 1959.

70
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,523
That's the first time
when it was deflected by Jupiter,

71
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,500
and it got close enough
to the sun to start changing.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,151
So it's a very fresh comet.

73
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:11,502
Rosetta made a few historic firsts.

74
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,018
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,

75
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:17,640
and to escort it throughout
its whole tour through the solar system --

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,938
closest approach to the sun,
as we will see in August,

77
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,259
and then away again to the exterior.

78
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,860
It's the first ever landing on a comet.

79
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,552
We actually orbit the comet
using something which is not

80
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,001
normally done with spacecraft.

81
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,636
Normally, you look at the sky and you know
where you point and where you are.

82
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,772
In this case, that's not enough.

83
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:40,070
We navigated by looking
at landmarks on the comet.

84
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,545
We recognized features --
boulders, craters --

85
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:46,562
and that's how we know where we are
respective to the comet.

86
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:51,091
And, of course, it's the first satellite
to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter

87
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,292
on solar cells.

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,619
Now, this sounds more heroic
than it actually is,

89
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:59,715
because the technology
to use radio isotope thermal generators

90
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:03,013
wasn't available in Europe at that time,
so there was no choice.

91
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,590
But these solar arrays are big.

92
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,865
This is one wing, and these are not
specially selected small people.

93
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,699
They're just like you and me.

94
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,090
(Laughter)

95
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,291
We have two of these wings,
65 square meters.

96
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,310
Now later on, of course,
when we got to the comet,

97
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,839
you find out that 65 square meters of sail

98
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,481
close to a body which is outgassing
is not always a very handy choice.

99
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,525
Now, how did we get to the comet?

100
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:34,193
Because we had to go there
for the Rosetta scientific objectives

101
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:38,001
very far away -- four times the distance
of the Earth to the sun --

102
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:42,111
and also at a much higher velocity
than we could achieve with fuel,

103
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:46,430
because we'd have to take six times as
much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.

104
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,840
So what do you do?

105
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,323
You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,

106
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,690
where you pass by a planet
at very low altitude,

107
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,455
a few thousand kilometers,

108
00:05:56,455 --> 00:06:01,168
and then you get the velocity
of that planet around the sun for free.

109
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:03,211
We did that a few times.

110
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:05,690
We did Earth, we did Mars,
we did twice Earth again,

111
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,658
and we also flew by two asteroids,
Lutetia and Steins.

112
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:14,983
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun
that if the spacecraft got into trouble,

113
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,792
we couldn't actually
save the spacecraft anymore,

114
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,765
so we went into hibernation.

115
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:24,103
Everything was switched off
except for one clock.

116
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:27,614
Here you see in white the trajectory,
and the way this works.

117
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:30,057
You see that from
the circle where we started,

118
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,873
the white line, actually you get
more and more and more elliptical,

119
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,822
and then finally we approached the comet

120
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:41,187
in May 2014, and we had to start
doing the rendezvous maneuvers.

121
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:45,784
On the way there, we flew by Earth and we
took a few pictures to test our cameras.

122
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,962
This is the moon rising over Earth,

123
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:49,917
and this is what we now call a selfie,

124
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,609
which at that time, by the way,
that word didn't exist. (Laughter)

125
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,580
It's at Mars. It was taken
by the CIVA camera.

126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,762
That's one of the cameras on the lander,

127
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:01,177
and it just looks under the solar arrays,

128
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:05,450
and you see the planet Mars
and the solar array in the distance.

129
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:11,118
Now, when we got out
of hibernation in January 2014,

130
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,903
we started arriving at a distance

131
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,736
of two million kilometers
from the comet in May.

132
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,845
However, the velocity
the spacecraft had was much too fast.

133
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:25,906
We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour
faster than the comet, so we had to brake.

134
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,763
We had to do eight maneuvers,

135
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,340
and you see here,
some of them were really big.

136
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,364
We had to brake the first one
by a few hundred kilometers per hour,

137
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:40,674
and actually, the duration of that
was seven hours,

138
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:43,622
and it used 218 kilos of fuel,

139
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:47,572
and those were seven nerve-wracking
hours, because in 2007,

140
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,762
there was a leak in the system
of the propulsion of Rosetta,

141
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,909
and we had to close off a branch,

142
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,487
so the system was actually
operating at a pressure

143
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:58,785
which it was never designed
or qualified for.

144
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:04,704
Then we got in the vicinity of the comet,
and these were the first pictures we saw.

145
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:07,277
The true comet rotation period
is 12 and a half hours,

146
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,366
so this is accelerated,

147
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,617
but you will understand that
our flight dynamics engineers thought,

148
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,471
this is not going to be
an easy thing to land on.

149
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:21,115
We had hoped for some kind
of spud-like thing

150
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:23,281
where you could easily land.

151
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,572
But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.

152
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,310
No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)

153
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,003
So at that point in time,
it was clearly unavoidable:

154
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:36,534
we had to map this body
in all the detail you could get,

155
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:41,687
because we had to find an area
which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.

156
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:46,286
Why 500 meters? That's the error
we have on landing the probe.

157
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:49,467
So we went through this process,
and we mapped the comet.

158
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,834
We used a technique
called photoclinometry.

159
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,064
You use shadows thrown by the sun.

160
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:57,151
What you see here is a rock
sitting on the surface of the comet,

161
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,077
and the sun shines from above.

162
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:02,236
From the shadow, we, with our brain,

163
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:05,880
can immediately determine
roughly what the shape of that rock is.

164
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,922
You can program that in a computer,

165
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:12,176
you then cover the whole comet,
and you can map the comet.

166
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,856
For that, we flew special trajectories
starting in August.

167
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,765
First, a triangle
of 100 kilometers on a side

168
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,428
at 100 kilometers' distance,

169
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:23,432
and we repeated the whole
thing at 50 kilometers.

170
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:27,079
At that time, we had seen the comet
at all kinds of angles,

171
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,752
and we could use this technique
to map the whole thing.

172
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:35,019
Now, this led to a selection
of landing sites.

173
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,279
This whole process we had to do,
to go from the mapping of the comet

174
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,844
to actually finding
the final landing site, was 60 days.

175
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,230
We didn't have more.

176
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,350
To give you an idea,
the average Mars mission

177
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,134
takes hundreds of scientists
for years to meet

178
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:52,201
about where shall we go?

179
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,359
We had 60 days, and that was it.

180
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,402
We finally selected the final landing site

181
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:02,455
and the commands were prepared
for Rosetta to launch Philae.

182
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:06,830
The way this works is that Rosetta
has to be at the right point in space,

183
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,653
and aiming towards the comet,
because the lander is passive.

184
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:13,330
The lander is then pushed out
and moves towards the comet.

185
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,120
Rosetta had to turn around

186
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,677
to get its cameras to actually look
at Philae while it was departing

187
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:22,146
and to be able to communicate with it.

188
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:26,720
Now, the landing duration
of the whole trajectory was seven hours.

189
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,507
Now do a simple calculation:

190
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:33,546
if the velocity of Rosetta is off
by one centimeter per second,

191
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,888
seven hours is 25,000 seconds.

192
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:42,253
That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.

193
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,597
So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta

194
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,104
much better than
one centimeter per second,

195
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:52,168
and its location in space
better than 100 meters

196
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,372
at 500 million kilometers from Earth.

197
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,740
That's no mean feat.

198
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,129
Let me quickly take you through
some of the science and the instruments.

199
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,565
I won't bore you with all the details
of all the instruments,

200
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,214
but it's got everything.

201
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,348
We can sniff gas,
we can measure dust particles,

202
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,600
the shape of them, the composition,

203
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,108
there are magnetometers, everything.

204
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,707
This is one of the results from
an instrument which measures gas density

205
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:20,565
at the position of Rosetta,

206
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:22,794
so it's gas which has left the comet.

207
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:25,278
The bottom graph
is September of last year.

208
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,575
There is a long-term variation,
which in itself is not surprising,

209
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:30,456
but you see the sharp peaks.

210
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,546
This is a comet day.

211
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:36,656
You can see the effect of the sun
on the evaporation of gas

212
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,604
and the fact that the comet is rotating.

213
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:41,312
So there is one spot, apparently,

214
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,459
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,

215
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,756
it gets heated in the Sun,
and then cools down on the back side.

216
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:50,262
And we can see
the density variations of this.

217
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:54,395
These are the gases
and the organic compounds

218
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:56,090
that we already have measured.

219
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,878
You will see it's an impressive list,

220
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,362
and there is much, much,
much more to come,

221
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:02,308
because there are more measurements.

222
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:05,656
Actually, there is a conference
going on in Houston at the moment

223
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,117
where many of these results are presented.

224
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,448
Also, we measured dust particles.

225
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:13,250
Now, for you, this will not
look very impressive,

226
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,523
but the scientists were thrilled
when they saw this.

227
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:17,940
Two dust particles:

228
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,934
the right one they call Boris,
and they shot it with tantalum

229
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:23,048
in order to be able to analyze it.

230
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:25,439
Now, we found sodium and magnesium.

231
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:29,688
What this tells you is this is
the concentration of these two materials

232
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:32,404
at the time the solar system was formed,

233
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:35,771
so we learned things about
which materials were there

234
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,859
when the planet was made.

235
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,577
Of course, one of the important
elements is the imaging.

236
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,943
This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
the OSIRIS camera,

237
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,938
and this actually was the cover
of Science magazine

238
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:50,608
on January 23 of this year.

239
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:54,046
Nobody had expected
this body to look like this.

240
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:57,644
Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks
more like the Half Dome in Yosemite

241
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,151
than anything else.

242
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,729
We also saw things like this:

243
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:07,651
dunes, and what look to be,
on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.

244
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:11,575
Now we know these from Mars,
but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,

245
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:14,454
so it's a bit difficult to create
a wind-blown shadow.

246
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,439
It may be local outgassing,

247
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,622
stuff which goes up and comes back.

248
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:21,803
We don't know, so there is
a lot to investigate.

249
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,893
Here, you see the same image twice.

250
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,410
On the left-hand side,
you see in the middle a pit.

251
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,627
On the right-hand side,
if you carefully look,

252
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,858
there are three jets coming out
of the bottom of that pit.

253
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,155
So this is the activity of the comet.

254
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:38,172
Apparently, at the bottom of these pits
is where the active regions are,

255
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,935
and where the material
evaporates into space.

256
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:44,545
There is a very intriguing crack
in the neck of the comet.

257
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,541
You see it on the right-hand side.

258
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,237
It's a kilometer long,
and it's two and a half meters wide.

259
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,483
Some people suggest that actually,

260
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,551
when we get close to the sun,

261
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,409
the comet may split in two,

262
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,089
and then we'll have to choose,

263
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,341
which comet do we go for?

264
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,514
The lander -- again, lots of instruments,

265
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:08,855
mostly comparable except for the things
which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.

266
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:12,732
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
because you want to compare

267
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:16,238
what you find in space
with what you find on the comet.

268
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:18,931
These are called
ground truth measurements.

269
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:22,162
These are the landing descent images

270
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,210
that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.

271
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,436
You see the lander getting further
and further away from Rosetta.

272
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:32,244
On the top right, you see an image
taken at 60 meters by the lander,

273
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:35,100
60 meters above the surface of the comet.

274
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,514
The boulder there is some 10 meters.

275
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:42,228
So this is one of the last images we took
before we landed on the comet.

276
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:45,786
Here, you see the whole sequence again,
but from a different perspective,

277
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,971
and you see three blown-ups
from the bottom-left to the middle

278
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:54,156
of the lander traveling
over the surface of the comet.

279
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:58,342
Then, at the top, there is a before
and an after image of the landing.

280
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:02,269
The only problem with the after image is,
there is no lander.

281
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,540
But if you carefully look
at the right-hand side of this image,

282
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,569
we saw the lander still there,
but it had bounced.

283
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,230
It had departed again.

284
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,317
Now, on a bit of a comical note here

285
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:18,937
is that originally Rosetta was designed
to have a lander which would bounce.

286
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,510
That was discarded because
it was way too expensive.

287
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,784
Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.

288
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,388
(Laughter)

289
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,895
During the first bounce,
in the magnetometers,

290
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:31,725
you see here the data from them,
from the three axes, x, y and z.

291
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,931
Halfway through, you see a red line.

292
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,765
At that red line, there is a change.

293
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:39,690
What happened, apparently,
is during the first bounce,

294
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,416
somewhere, we hit the edge of a crater
with one of the legs of the lander,

295
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,236
and the rotation velocity
of the lander changed.

296
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:49,209
So we've been rather lucky

297
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,485
that we are where we are.

298
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:55,154
This is one of
the iconic images of Rosetta.

299
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,077
It's a man-made object,
a leg of the lander,

300
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,028
standing on a comet.

301
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:06,159
This, for me, is one of the very best
images of space science I have ever seen.

302
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,340
(Applause)

303
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,191
One of the things we still have to do
is to actually find the lander.

304
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,887
The blue area here
is where we know it must be.

305
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:22,505
We haven't been able to find it yet,
but the search is continuing,

306
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:26,270
as are our efforts to start getting
the lander to work again.

307
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,012
We listen every day,

308
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,570
and we hope that between now
and somewhere in April,

309
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,308
the lander will wake up again.

310
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,445
The findings of what
we found on the comet:

311
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,251
This thing would float in water.

312
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,875
It's half the density of water.

313
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,893
So it looks like
a very big rock, but it's not.

314
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:47,539
The activity increase we saw
in June, July, August last year

315
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,930
was a four-fold activity increase.

316
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,673
By the time we will be at the sun,

317
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:56,246
there will be 100 kilos
a second leaving this comet:

318
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,802
gas, dust, whatever.

319
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:00,333
That's 100 million kilos a day.

320
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,978
Then, finally, the landing day.

321
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:09,366
I will never forget -- absolute madness,
250 TV crews in Germany.

322
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,385
The BBC was interviewing me,

323
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:14,357
and another TV crew
who was following me all day

324
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,493
were filming me being interviewed,

325
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,931
and it went on like that
for the whole day.

326
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,742
The Discovery Channel crew

327
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:23,064
actually caught me
when leaving the control room,

328
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,177
and they asked the right question,

329
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,802
and man, I got into tears,
and I still feel this.

330
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:30,485
For a month and a half,

331
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,319
I couldn't think about
landing day without crying,

332
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,034
and I still have the emotion in me.
