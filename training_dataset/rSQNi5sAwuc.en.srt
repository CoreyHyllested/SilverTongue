0
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:17,270
The brain is an amazing and complex organ.

1
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,068
And while many people
are fascinated by the brain,

2
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,835
they can't really tell you that much

3
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,102
about the properties
about how the brain works

4
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,455
because we don't teach
neuroscience in schools.

5
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:28,898
And one of the reasons
why is that the equipment

6
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,557
is so complex and so expensive

7
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:35,703
that it's really only done at major
universities and large institutions.

8
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,942
And so in order to be able
to access the brain,

9
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,767
you really need to dedicate your life

10
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,247
and spend six and a half years
as a graduate student

11
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:45,202
just to become a neuroscientist
to get access to these tools.

12
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,539
And that's a shame
because one out of five of us,

13
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,365
that's 20 percent of the entire world,
will have a neurological disorder.

14
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:54,796
And there are zero cures
for these diseases.

15
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:57,015
And so it seems that
what we should be doing

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,432
is reaching back earlier
in the eduction process

17
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:04,009
and teaching students about neuroscience
so that in the future,

18
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,961
they may be thinking about possibly
becoming a brain scientist.

19
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:11,758
When I was a graduate student,
my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,

20
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:15,639
decided that what if we took
this complex equipment that we have

21
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,038
for studying the brain and made it simple
enough and affordable enough

22
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:22,354
that anyone that you know, an amateur
or a high school student,

23
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:25,836
could learn and actually participate
in the discovery of neuroscience.

24
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,573
And so we did just that.

25
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:30,466
A few years ago, we started
a company called Backyard Brains

26
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:34,871
and we make DIY neuroscience equipment
and I brought some here tonight,

27
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,377
and I want to do some demonstrations.

28
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:38,811
You guys want to see some?

29
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,774
So I need a volunteer.

30
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:44,027
So right before -- what is your name?
(Applause)

31
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,070
Sam Kelly: Sam.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,095
Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going
to record from your brain.

33
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,849
Have you had this before?

34
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:50,950
SK: No.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,264
GG: I need you to stick out
your arm for science,

36
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:54,833
roll up your sleeve a bit,

37
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,713
So what I'm going to do,
I'm putting electrodes on your arm,

38
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,202
and you're probably wondering,

39
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,941
I just said I'm going to record from your
brain, what am I doing with your arm?

40
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:06,175
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons
inside your brain right now.

41
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,663
They're sending electrical messages
back and forth, and chemical messages.

42
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,336
But some of your neurons
right here in your motor cortex

43
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,431
are going to send messages down
when you move your arm like this.

44
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,915
They're going to go down
across your corpus callosum,

45
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:20,449
down onto your spinal cord
to your lower motor neuron

46
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,718
out to your muscles here,

47
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,327
and that electrical discharge
is going to be picked up

48
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,861
by these electrodes right here

49
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,583
and we're going to be able to listen

50
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,835
to exactly what your brain
is going to be doing.

51
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:31,835
So I'm going to turn this on for a second.

52
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:34,131
Have you ever heard
what your brain sounds like?

53
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:35,131
SK: No.

54
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,900
GG: Let's try it out.
So go ahead and squeeze your hand.

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,972
(Rumbling)

56
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,848
So what you're listening to,

57
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:44,111
so this is your motor units
happening right here.

58
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,192
Let's take a look at it as well.

59
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,961
So I'm going to stand over here,

60
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,152
and I'm going to open up our app here.

61
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,727
So now I want you to squeeze.

62
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:54,727
(Rumbling)

63
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,674
So right here, these are the motor units
that are happening

64
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:00,133
from her spinal cord
out to her muscle right here,

65
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,355
and as she's doing it,

66
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:04,189
you're seeing the electrical activity
that's happening here.

67
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,630
You can even click here
and try to see one of them.

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,101
So keep doing it really hard.

69
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,171
So now we've paused

70
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:13,451
on one motor action potential that's
happening right now inside of your brain.

71
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,227
Do you guys want to see some more?

72
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,810
(Applause)

73
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,929
That's interesting,
but let's get it better.

74
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:20,278
I need one more volunteer.

75
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,487
What is your name, sir?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,207
Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.

77
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:26,400
GG: Miguel, all right.

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,976
You're going to stand right here.

79
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,968
So when you're moving your arm like this,

80
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,083
your brain is sending a signal
down to your muscles right here.

81
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,857
I want you to move your arm as well.

82
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,731
So your brain is going to send
a signal down to your muscles.

83
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:41,580
And so it turns out that there is
a nerve that's right here

84
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,336
that runs up here that innervates
these three fingers,

85
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,012
and it's close enough to the skin
that we might be able

86
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:49,346
to stimulate that so that what we can do

87
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:52,832
is copy your brain signals
going out to your hand

88
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,353
and inject it into your hand,

89
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:57,726
so that your hand will move
when your brain tells your hand to move.

90
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:00,933
So in a sense, she will take away
your free will

91
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,893
and you will no longer have
any control over this hand.

92
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,567
You with me?

93
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,618
So I just need to hook you up.

94
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:09,369
(Laughter)

95
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,430
So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,

96
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,392
which is probably right around here.

97
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,631
You don't know what you're signing up for

98
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,726
when you come up.

99
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,499
So now I'm going to move away
and we're going to plug it in

100
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,575
to our human-to-human interface over here.

101
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:27,392
Okay, so Sam, I want you
to squeeze your hand again.

102
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,152
Do it again. Perfect.

103
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:34,155
So now I'm going to hook you up
over here so that you get the --

104
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,399
It's going to feel
a little bit weird at first,

105
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,863
this is going to feel like a --
(Laughter)

106
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,680
You know, when you lose your free will,
and someone else becomes your agent,

107
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,306
it does feel a bit strange.

108
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,208
Now I want you to relax your hand.

109
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,532
Sam, you're with me?

110
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:48,997
So you're going to squeeze.

111
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,284
I'm not going to turn it on yet,
so go ahead and give it a squeeze.

112
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,240
So now, are you ready, Miguel?

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,062
MG: Ready as I'll ever be.

114
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,265
GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead
and turn your hand.

115
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,298
Do you feel that a little bit?
MG: Nope.

116
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,198
GG: Okay, do it again?
MG: A little bit.

117
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:04,884
GG: A little bit? (Laughter)

118
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:05,909
So relax.

119
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:07,325
So hit it again.

120
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,521
(Laughter)

121
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,226
Oh, perfect, perfect.

122
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,110
So relax, do it again.

123
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,878
All right, so right now,

124
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:19,279
your brain is controlling your arm
and it's also controlling his arm,

125
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,471
so go ahead and just do it one more time.

126
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,504
All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)

127
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:27,265
So now, what would happen
if I took over my control of your hand?

128
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:29,508
And so, just relax your hand.

129
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,726
What happens?

130
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,760
Ah, nothing.

131
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,298
Why not?

132
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:35,993
Because the brain has to do it.

133
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,307
So you do it again.

134
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,780
All right, that's perfect.

135
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,319
Thank you guys for being
such a good sport.

136
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,575
This is what's happening
all across the world --

137
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,911
electrophysiology!

138
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,158
We're going to bring on
the neuro-revolution.

139
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,175
Thank you.

140
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,928
(Applause)
