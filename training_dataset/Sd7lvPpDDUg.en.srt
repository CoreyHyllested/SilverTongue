00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,604
Ichthyology,

1
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:16,088
the study of fishes.

2
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:18,970
It looks like a big, boring word,

3
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:21,175
but it's actually quite exciting,

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,172
because ichthyology is the only "ology"

5
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:25,527
with "YOLO" in it.

6
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,335
(Laughter)

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,185
Now, to the cool kids in the audience,

8
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:33,386
you already know, YOLO stands for
"you only live once,"

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,072
and because I only have one life,

10
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:37,859
I'm going to spend it doing
what I always dreamt of doing:

11
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:41,043
seeing the hidden wonders of the world
and discovering new species.

12
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,566
And that's what I get to do.

13
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:47,328
Now, in recent years, I really focused
on caves for finding new species.

14
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:50,618
And it turns out, there's lots of new
cavefish species out there.

15
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,425
You just have to know where to look,

16
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,658
and to maybe be a little thin.

17
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:55,776
(Laughter)

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,825
Now, cavefishes can tell me
a lot about biology and geology.

19
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:04,197
They can tell me how the landmasses
around them have changed and moved

20
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:06,439
by being stuck in these little holes,

21
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:10,026
and they can tell me about
the evolution of sight, by being blind.

22
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:14,470
Now, fish have eyes
that are essentially the same as ours.

23
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:18,322
All vertebrates do, and each time
a fish species starts to adapt

24
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,758
to this dark, cold, cave environment,

25
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:24,719
over many, many generations,
they lose their eyes and their eyesight

26
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:27,893
until the end up like an eyeless
cavefish like this one here.

27
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:31,754
Now, each cavefish species
has evolved in a slightly different way,

28
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:35,850
and each one has a unique geological
and biological story to tell us,

29
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:38,801
and that's why it's so exciting
when we find a new species.

30
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:42,654
So this is a new species
we described, from southern Indiana.

31
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:46,972
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,
the Hoosier cavefish.

32
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:48,057
(Laughter)

33
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,010
Its closest relatives
are cavefishes in Kentucky,

34
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,636
in the Mammoth Cave system.

35
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,693
And they start to diverge
when the Ohio River split them

36
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,002
a few million years ago.

37
00:01:57,419 --> 00:02:00,162
And in that time they developed
these subtle differences

38
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,947
in the genetic architecture
behind their blindness.

39
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,805
There's this gene called rhodopsin
that's super-critical for sight.

40
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,226
We have it, and these species have it too,

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,123
except one species has lost
all function in that gene,

42
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:13,821
and the other one maintains it.

43
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:18,257
So this sets up this beautiful
natural experiment

44
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:21,245
where we can look at the genes
behind our vision,

45
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,928
and at the very roots of how we can see.

46
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,761
But the genes in these cavefishes

47
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:29,571
can also tell us
about deep geological time,

48
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,055
maybe no more so
than in this species here.

49
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,896
This is a new species
we described from Madagascar

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,221
that we named Typhleotris mararybe.

51
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:41,510
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,

52
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:44,083
for how sick we got trying
to collect this species.

53
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,192
Now, believe it or not,

54
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,806
swimming around sinkholes
full of dead things

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,713
and cave full of bat poop

56
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,546
isn't the smartest thing you could
be doing with your life,

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,079
but YOLO.

58
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:58,898
(Laughter)

59
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:03,096
Now, I love this species despite the fact
that it tried to kill us,

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,915
and that's because
this species in Madagascar,

61
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,763
its closest relatives
are 6,000 kilometers away,

62
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,151
cavefishes in Australia.

63
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:14,336
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
freshwater cavefish

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,399
can swim across the Indian Ocean,

65
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:19,254
so what we found when we compared
the DNA of these species

66
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,575
is that they've been separated
for more than 100 million years,

67
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,938
or about the time that the southern
continents were last together.

68
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,081
So in fact, these species
didn't move at all.

69
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,906
It's the continents that moved them.

70
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,953
And so they give us, through their DNA,

71
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,398
this precise model and measure

72
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:39,580
of how to date and time
these ancient geological events.

73
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,296
Now, this species here is so new

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,803
I'm not even allowed
to tell you its name yet,

75
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,489
but I can tell you
it's a new species from Mexico,

76
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,264
and it's probably already extinct.

77
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:54,014
It's probably extinct because
the only known cave system it's from

78
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,690
was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

79
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,676
Unfortunately for cavefishes,

80
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,280
their groundwater habitat

81
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:02,500
is also our main source of drinking water.

82
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:07,801
Now, we actually don't know
this species' closest relative, yet.

83
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:10,475
It doesn't appear to be
anything else in Mexico,

84
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,199
so maybe it's something in Cuba,

85
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,245
or Florida, or India.

86
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,335
But whatever it is, it might tell us
something new about the geology

87
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,567
of the Caribbean, or the biology
of how to better diagnose

88
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,712
certain types of blindness.

89
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:28,146
But I hope we discover this species
before it goes extinct too.

90
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,648
And I'm going to spend my one life

91
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:34,201
as an ichthyologist
trying to discover and save

92
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,803
these humble little blind cavefishes

93
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:40,293
that can tell us so much
about the geology of the planet

94
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,133
and the biology of how we see.

95
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:43,823
Thank you.

96
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:48,206
(Applause)
