00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,635
Chris Anderson: This is such
a strange thing.

1
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:18,817
Your software, Linux,
is in millions of computers,

2
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:22,388
it probably powers much of the Internet.

3
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,175
And I think that there are, like,

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,544
a billion and a half active
Android devices out there.

5
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:30,169
Your software is in every
single one of them.

6
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:31,958
It's kind of amazing.

7
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:37,017
You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this.

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,347
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
when I saw a picture of it.

9
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,571
I mean, this is --

10
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:43,845
this is the Linux world headquarters.

11
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,859
(Laughter)

12
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:49,889
(Applause)

13
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:52,199
Linus Torvalds: It really
doesn't look like much.

14
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:53,899
And I have to say,

15
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:57,743
the most interesting part in this picture,

16
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,470
that people mostly react to,

17
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:00,937
is the walking desk.

18
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,660
It is the most interesting
part in my office

19
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:05,644
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

20
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,960
And I think the two things are related.

21
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:11,531
The way I work is ...

22
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:17,594
I want to not have external stimulation.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,437
You can kind of see,
on the walls are this light green.

24
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,925
I'm told that at mental institutions
they use that on the walls.

25
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:28,996
(Laughter)

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,805
It's like a calming color,

27
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,946
it's not something
that really stimulates you.

28
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:39,489
What you can't see is the computer here,
you only see the screen,

29
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:42,894
but the main thing I worry
about in my computer is --

30
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:46,253
it doesn't have to be big
and powerful, although I like that --

31
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:49,109
it really has to be completely silent.

32
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,986
I know people who work for Google

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,217
and they have their own
small data center at home,

34
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,393
and I don't do that.

35
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:00,122
My office is the most
boring office you'll ever see.

36
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:03,660
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

37
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,173
If the cat comes up,

38
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:08,034
it sits in my lap.

39
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,248
And I want to hear the cat purring,

40
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,446
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,779
CA: So this is astonishing,

42
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:17,481
because working this way,

43
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,493
you're able to run this vast
technology empire --

44
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:21,738
it is an empire --

45
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:25,462
so that's an amazing testament
to the power of open source.

46
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:29,662
Tell us how you got
to understand open source

47
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,938
and how it lead
to the development of Linux.

48
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:35,051
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

49
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:38,642
Really -- I work alone in my house,

50
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,056
often in my bathrobe.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,641
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

52
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:43,951
so I have clothes on.

53
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,212
(Laughter)

54
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:47,308
And that's how I've always worked.

55
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,340
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

56
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:53,013
I did not start Linux
as a collaborative project.

57
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:57,915
I started it as one
in a series of many projects

58
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,896
I had done at the time for myself,

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,822
partly because I needed the end result,

60
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:06,148
but even more because I just
enjoyed programming.

61
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:10,546
So it was about the end of the journey,

62
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,916
which, 25 years later,
we still have not reached.

63
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,657
But it was really about the fact
that I was looking for a project on my own

64
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,510
and there was no open source,
really, on my radar at all.

65
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:24,000
And what happened is ...

66
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:29,220
the project grows and becomes something
you want to show off to people.

67
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:34,669
Really, this is more of a, "Wow,
look at what I did!"

68
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,248
And trust me -- it was not
that great back then.

69
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:40,002
I made it publicly available,

70
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:42,132
and it wasn't even
open source at that point.

71
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:47,325
At that point it was source that was open,
but there was no intention

72
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,463
behind using the kind of open-source
methodology that we think of today

73
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,638
to improve it.

74
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:54,813
It was more like,

75
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:57,774
"Look, I've been working
on this for half a year,

76
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,198
I'd love to have comments."

77
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,717
And other people approached me.

78
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:04,869
At the University of Helsinki,

79
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:08,608
I had a friend who was one
of the open source --

80
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:12,288
it was called mainly
"free software" back then --

81
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:16,586
and he actually introduced me
to the notion that, hey,

82
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,967
you can use these open-source
licenses that had been around.

83
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,155
And I thought about it for a while.

84
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,670
I was actually worried about the whole
commercial interests coming in.

85
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:34,168
I mean, that's one of the worries
I think most people who start out have,

86
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:39,152
is that they worry about somebody
taking advantage of their work, right?

87
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,859
And I decided, "What the hell?"

88
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,890
And --

89
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,209
CA: And then at some point,

90
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,693
someone contributed
some code that you thought,

91
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:51,888
"Wow, that really is interesting,
I would not have thought of that.

92
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,563
This could actually improve this."

93
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:56,112
LT: It didn't even start
by people contributing code,

94
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:59,115
it was more that people
started contributing ideas.

95
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,994
And just the fact that somebody else
takes a look at your project --

96
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,566
and I'm sure it's true
of other things, too,

97
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,427
but it's definitely true in code --

98
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,950
is that somebody else
takes an interest in your code,

99
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,496
looks at it enough to actually
give you feedback

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,409
and give you ideas.

101
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,134
That was a huge thing for me.

102
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:20,350
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

103
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,611
but I had already programmed
for half my life, basically.

104
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:28,344
And every project before that
had been completely personal

105
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:31,475
and it was a revelation when people
just started commenting,

106
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,800
started giving feedback on your code.

107
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:38,596
And even before they started
giving code back,

108
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,361
that was, I think, one of the big
moments where I said,

109
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,258
"I love other people!"

110
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:44,439
Don't get me wrong --

111
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:46,087
I'm actually not a people person.

112
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,476
(Laughter)

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,052
I don't really love other people --

114
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:53,096
(Laughter)

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,746
But I love computers,

116
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,985
I love interacting with other
people on email,

117
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,341
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

118
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:06,866
But I do love other people who comment
and get involved in my project.

119
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,543
And it made it so much more.

120
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:12,107
CA: So was there a moment
when you saw what was being built

121
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:14,338
and it suddenly started taking off,

122
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:17,652
and you thought, "Wait a sec,
this actually could be something huge,

123
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,588
not just a personal project
that I'm getting nice feedback on,

124
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:24,932
but a kind of explosive development
in the whole technology world"?

125
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,980
LT: Not really.

126
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:30,576
I mean, the big point for me, really,
was not when it was becoming huge,

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,734
it was when it was becoming little.

128
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,226
The big point for me was not being alone

129
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,967
and having 10, maybe 100
people being involved --

130
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,470
that was a big point.

131
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:45,533
Then everything else was very gradual.

132
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:49,816
Going from 100 people to a million people
is not a big deal -- to me.

133
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,673
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

134
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,698
(Laughter)

135
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:55,440
If you want to sell your result
then it's a huge deal --

136
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,615
don't get me wrong.

137
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,766
But if you're interested in the technology

138
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,645
and you're interested in the project,

139
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,550
the big part was getting the community.

140
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,198
Then the community grew gradually.

141
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:07,570
And there's actually not
a single point where I went like,

142
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,342
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

143
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:13,690
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

144
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:16,690
CA: So all the technologists
that I talk to really credit you

145
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,588
with massively changing their work.

146
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:21,235
And it's not just Linux,

147
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,705
it's this thing called Git,

148
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,741
which is this management system
for software development.

149
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,550
Tell us briefly about that
and your role in that.

150
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,270
LT: So one of the issues we had,

151
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:35,346
and this took a while to start to appear,

152
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,525
is when you ...

153
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:43,040
When you grow from having 10 people
or 100 people working on a project

154
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,452
to having 10,000 people, which --

155
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:48,942
I mean, right now we're in the situation
where just on the kernel,

156
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:52,140
we have 1,000 people involved
in every single release

157
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:55,750
and that's every two months,
roughly two or three months.

158
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,757
Some of those people don't do a lot.

159
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,364
There's a lot of people
who make small, small changes.

160
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,634
But to maintain this,

161
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:06,547
the scale changes how
you have to maintain it.

162
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,969
And we went through a lot of pain.

163
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:17,242
And there are whole projects
that do only source-code maintenance.

164
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,558
CVS is the one that used to be
the most commonly used,

165
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:24,479
and I hated CVS with a passion
and refused to touch it

166
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,566
and tried something else
that was radical and interesting

167
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,246
and everybody else hated.

168
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,378
CA: (Laughs)

169
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,490
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

170
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,331
where we had thousands of people
who wanted to participate,

171
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:42,396
but in many ways,
I was the kind of break point,

172
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,944
where I could not scale to the point

173
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,768
where I could work
with thousands of people.

174
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,244
So Git is my second big project,

175
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,806
which was only created for me
to maintain my first big project.

176
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,680
And this is literally how I work.

177
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,209
I don't code for --

178
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,955
well, I do code for fun --

179
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,360
but I want to code
for something meaningful

180
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:08,431
so every single project I've ever done
has been something I needed

181
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,831
and --

182
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:13,288
CA: So really, both Linux
and Git kind of arose

183
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,648
almost as an unintended consequence

184
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,343
of your desire not to have
to work with too many people.

185
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:19,518
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

186
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,622
(Laughter)

187
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,296
CA: That's amazing.
LT: Yeah.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,812
(Applause)

189
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:27,227
And yet, you're the man
who's transformed technology

190
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,568
not just once but twice,

191
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:31,175
and we have to try
and understand why it is.

192
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,883
You've given us some clues, but ...

193
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:37,548
Here's a picture of you as a kid,
with a Rubik's Cube.

194
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,692
You mentioned that you've been
programming since you were like 10 or 11,

195
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,081
half your life.

196
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:46,921
Were you this sort of computer
genius, you know, übernerd,

197
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:49,430
were you the star at school
who could do everything?

198
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:50,986
What were you like as a kid?

199
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,623
LT: Yeah, I think I was
the prototypical nerd.

200
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:55,916
I mean, I was ...

201
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,092
I was not a people person back then.

202
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:01,696
That's my younger brother.

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,507
I was clearly more interested
in the Rubik's Cube

204
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,056
than my younger brother.

205
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,167
(Laughter)

206
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,311
My younger sister,
who's not in the picture,

207
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,749
when we had family meetings --

208
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:16,565
and it's not a huge family, but I have,
like, a couple of cousins --

209
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,453
she would prep me beforehand.

210
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:22,043
Like, before I stepped
into the room she would say,

211
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,610
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

212
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,254
Because I was not --

213
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,493
I was a geek.

214
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,683
I was into computers,

215
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,866
I was into math,

216
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,041
I was into physics.

217
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,216
I was good at that.

218
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,026
I don't think I was
particularly exceptional.

219
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,945
Apparently, my sister said

220
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:46,820
that my biggest exceptional quality
was that I would not let go.

221
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:50,175
CA: OK, so let's go there,
because that's interesting.

222
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,373
You would not let go.

223
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:54,262
So that's not about being
a geek and being smart,

224
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,391
that's about being ... stubborn?

225
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,942
LT: That's about being stubborn.

226
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,354
That's about, like,

227
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,293
just starting something

228
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:08,767
and not saying, "OK, I'm done,
let's do something else --

229
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,978
Look: shiny!"

230
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:14,335
And I notice that in many
other parts in my life, too.

231
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,720
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

232
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,856
And I worked for the same
company, in Silicon Valley,

233
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,594
for the whole time.

234
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,156
That is unheard of.

235
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:28,971
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

236
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,574
The whole point of Silicon Valley
is that people jump between jobs

237
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:35,225
to kind of mix up the pot.

238
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,129
And that's not the kind of person I am.

239
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,724
CA: But during the actual
development of Linux itself,

240
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:44,044
that stubbornness sometimes brought
you in conflict with other people.

241
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,099
Talk about that a bit.

242
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:51,667
Was that essential to sort of maintain
the quality of what was being built?

243
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,856
How would you describe what happened?

244
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,475
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

245
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:00,384
Going back to the "I'm not
a people person," --

246
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,196
sometimes I'm also ...

247
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,633
shall we say,

248
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:09,077
"myopic" when it comes
to other people's feelings,

249
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:14,945
and that sometimes makes you
say things that hurt other people.

250
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,737
And I'm not proud of that.

251
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,875
(Applause)

252
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,697
But, at the same time, it's --

253
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:26,054
I get people who tell me
that I should be nice.

254
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:32,464
And then when I try to explain to them
that maybe you're nice,

255
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,742
maybe you should be more aggressive,

256
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:38,308
they see that as me being not nice.

257
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:40,442
(Laughter)

258
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:42,634
What I'm trying to say
is we are different.

259
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,468
I'm not a people person;

260
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,598
it's not something
I'm particularly proud of,

261
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,162
but it's part of me.

262
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,891
And one of the things
I really like about open source

263
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:56,707
is it really allows different
people to work together.

264
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,455
We don't have to like each other --

265
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,682
and sometimes we really
don't like each other.

266
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:04,193
Really -- I mean, there are very,
very heated arguments.

267
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:07,209
But you can, actually,
you can find things that --

268
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,554
you don't even agree to disagree,

269
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:13,624
it's just that you're interested
in really different things.

270
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,551
And coming back to the point
where I said earlier

271
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:20,868
that I was afraid of commercial people
taking advantage of your work,

272
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:23,491
it turned out, and very
quickly turned out,

273
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:26,481
that those commercial people
were lovely, lovely people.

274
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,211
And they did all the things that I was not
at all interested in doing,

275
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,292
and they had completely different goals.

276
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:37,639
And they used open source in ways
that I just did not want to go.

277
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,925
But because it was open
source they could do it,

278
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,301
and it actually works
really beautifully together.

279
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,349
And I actually think
it works the same way.

280
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:47,578
You need to have the people-people,
the communicators,

281
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,029
the warm and friendly people

282
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,775
who like --

283
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,241
(Laughter)

284
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,315
really want to hug you
and get you into the community.

285
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:56,910
But that's not everybody.

286
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,366
And that's not me.

287
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,847
I care about the technology.

288
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,752
There are people who care about the UI.

289
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,846
I can't do UI to save my life.

290
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,891
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

291
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,315
and the only way to get off that island
was the make a pretty UI,

292
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,502
I'd die there.

293
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,677
(Laughter)

294
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,840
So there's different kinds of people,

295
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,729
and I'm not making excuses,
I'm trying to explain.

296
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:20,419
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

297
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,928
you talked about some
other trait that you have,

298
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:24,543
which I found really interesting.

299
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:25,950
It's this idea called taste.

300
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:27,976
And I've just got a couple of images here.

301
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:32,357
I think this is an example of not
particularly good taste in code,

302
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:35,372
and this one is better taste,

303
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,459
which one can immediately see.

304
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,456
What is the difference between these two?

305
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,821
LT: So this is --

306
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,522
How many people here actually have coded?

307
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,191
CA: Oh my goodness.

308
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,370
LT: So I guarantee you,

309
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:49,939
everybody who raised their hand,

310
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,584
they have done what's called
a singly-linked list.

311
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,617
And it's taught --

312
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,706
This, the first not very
good taste approach,

313
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,797
is basically how it's taught to be done
when you start out coding.

314
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,865
And you don't have to understand the code.

315
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,945
The most interesting part to me

316
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,158
is the last if statement.

317
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,193
Because what happens
in a singly-linked list --

318
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,867
this is trying to remove
an existing entry from a list --

319
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:20,733
and there's a difference
between if it's the first entry

320
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:22,756
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

321
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,385
Because if it's the first entry,

322
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:27,425
you have to change
the pointer to the first entry.

323
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,647
If it's in the middle,

324
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:31,092
you have to change the pointer
of a previous entry.

325
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,140
So they're two completely different cases.

326
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,316
CA: And that's better.

327
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,521
LT: And this is better.

328
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,263
It does not have the if statement.

329
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,850
And it doesn't really matter --

330
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,075
I don't want you understand
why it doesn't have the if statement,

331
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:45,441
but I want you to understand

332
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:48,090
that sometimes you can see
a problem in a different way

333
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,468
and rewrite it so that
a special case goes away

334
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,369
and becomes the normal case.

335
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:54,932
And that's good code.

336
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,878
But this is simple code.

337
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,251
This is CS 101.

338
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:01,131
This is not important --
although, details are important.

339
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:05,876
To me, the sign of people
I really want to work with

340
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,573
is that they have good taste,
which is how ...

341
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,892
I sent you this stupid example

342
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,260
that is not relevant
because it's too small.

343
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:15,885
Good taste is much bigger than this.

344
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,930
Good taste is about really
seeing the big patterns

345
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:24,412
and kind of instinctively knowing
what's the right way to do things.

346
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:27,093
CA: OK, so we're putting
the pieces together here now.

347
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,203
You have taste,

348
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,394
in a way that's meaningful
to software people.

349
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:33,569
You're --

350
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,409
(Laughter)

351
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,994
LT: I think it was meaningful
to some people here.

352
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,884
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

353
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,605
and you're hellish stubborn.

354
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:47,208
But there must be something else.

355
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,855
I mean, you've changed the future.

356
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,842
You must have the ability
of these grand visions of the future.

357
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,127
You're a visionary, right?

358
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,742
LT: I've actually felt slightly
uncomfortable at TED

359
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,926
for the last two days,

360
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,545
because there's a lot
of vision going on, right?

361
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,266
And I am not a visionary.

362
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,519
I do not have a five-year plan.

363
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:05,901
I'm an engineer.

364
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,185
And I think it's really --

365
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,528
I mean -- I'm perfectly
happy with all the people

366
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:12,303
who are walking around
and just staring at the clouds

367
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:15,178
and looking at the stars
and saying, "I want to go there."

368
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,654
But I'm looking at the ground,

369
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,533
and I want to fix the pothole
that's right in front of me

370
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:20,917
before I fall in.

371
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,560
This is the kind of person I am.

372
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,695
(Cheers)

373
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,031
(Applause)

374
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,666
CA: So you spoke to me last week
about these two guys.

375
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:31,793
Who are they and how
do you relate to them?

376
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:35,841
LT: Well, so this is kind
of cliché in technology,

377
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:37,872
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

378
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:42,837
where Tesla is seen as the visionary
scientist and crazy idea man.

379
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,643
And people love Tesla.

380
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,654
I mean, there are people who name
their companies after him.

381
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,828
(Laughter)

382
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:53,977
The other person there is Edison,

383
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,508
who is actually often vilified
for being kind of pedestrian

384
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,453
and is --

385
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:02,199
I mean, his most famous quote is,

386
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:06,937
"Genius is one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration."

387
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:08,847
And I'm in the Edison camp,

388
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,055
even if people don't always like him.

389
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,098
Because if you actually compare the two,

390
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:18,655
Tesla has kind of this mind
grab these days,

391
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,678
but who actually changed the world?

392
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:25,235
Edison may not have been a nice person,

393
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,391
he did a lot of things --

394
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,844
he was maybe not so intellectual,

395
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,095
not so visionary.

396
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,780
But I think I'm more
of an Edison than a Tesla.

397
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,107
CA: So our theme at TED
this week is dreams --

398
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,478
big, bold, audacious dreams.

399
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,304
You're really the antidote to that.

400
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:45,437
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

401
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:46,612
CA: That's good.

402
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:47,716
(Laughter)

403
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,345
We embrace you, we embrace you.

404
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,795
Companies like Google and many
others have made, arguably,

405
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,025
like, billions of dollars
out of your software.

406
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:57,200
Does that piss you off?

407
00:18:57,224 --> 00:18:58,375
LT: No.

408
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:01,033
No, it doesn't piss me off
for several reasons.

409
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,067
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

410
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,387
I'm really doing fine.

411
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,526
But the other reason is --

412
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,877
I mean, without doing the whole
open source and really letting go thing,

413
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,127
Linux would never have been what it is.

414
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:19,247
And it's brought experiences
I don't really enjoy, public talking,

415
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,422
but at the same time,
this is an experience.

416
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,726
Trust me.

417
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:28,381
So there's a lot of things going on
that make me a very happy man

418
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,934
and thinking I did the right choices.

419
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,870
CA: Is the open source idea --

420
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:34,530
this is, I think we'll end here --

421
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:38,608
is the open source idea
fully realized now in the world,

422
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:41,650
or is there more that it could go,

423
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,689
are there more things that it could do?

424
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:46,972
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

425
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:51,482
I think one reason open source
works so well in code

426
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,915
is that at the end of the day,

427
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:57,185
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

428
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,366
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

429
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,336
this is done correctly
and this is not done well.

430
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,738
Code either works or it doesn't,

431
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:12,370
which means that there's less
room for arguments.

432
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:16,025
And we have arguments despite this, right?

433
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,964
In many other areas --

434
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:21,729
I mean, people have talked about
open politics and things like that --

435
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,702
and it's really hard sometimes to say

436
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:28,483
that, yes, you can apply the same
principles in some other areas

437
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:33,946
just because the black and white
turns into not just gray,

438
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,573
but different colors.

439
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:40,705
So, obviously open source in science
is making a comeback.

440
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,363
Science was there first.

441
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:45,054
But then science ended up
being pretty closed,

442
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,702
with very expensive journals
and some of that going on.

443
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:52,562
And open source is making
a comeback in science,

444
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:56,733
with things like arXiv and open journals.

445
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:01,215
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

446
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,693
So there are other examples,

447
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm sure there are more to come.

448
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,227
CA: But you're not a visionary,

449
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,204
and so it's not up to you to name them.

450
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,387
LT: No.

451
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,459
(Laughter)

452
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,447
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

453
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:14,734
CA: Exactly.

454
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:15,916
Linus Torvalds,

455
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,185
thank you for Linux,
thank you for the Internet,

456
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,074
thank you for all those Android phones.

457
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:23,295
Thank you for coming here to TED
and revealing so much of yourself.

458
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,471
LT: Thank you.

459
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:28,935
(Applause)
