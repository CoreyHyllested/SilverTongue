0
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:16,403
The world is filled
with incredible objects

1
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,355
and rich cultural heritage.

2
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:21,419
And when we get access to them,

3
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,827
we are blown away, we fall in love.

4
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:26,249
But most of the time,

5
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:31,065
the world's population is living
without real access to arts and culture.

6
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:37,299
What might the connections be
when we start exploring our heritage,

7
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:40,530
the beautiful locations
and the art in this world?

8
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:44,201
Before we get started
in this presentation,

9
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:47,200
I just want to take care
of a few housekeeping points.

10
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,999
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

11
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:53,749
I fell into this by mistake,
but I'm loving it.

12
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:57,352
Secondly, all of what
I'm going to show you

13
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:01,341
belongs to the amazing museums,
archives and foundations

14
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,791
that we partner with.

15
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,671
None of this belongs to Google.

16
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:08,424
And finally, what you see behind me

17
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:11,799
is available right now
on your mobile phones,

18
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:12,997
on your laptops.

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,425
This is our current platform,
where you can explore

20
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:18,860
thousands of museums
and objects at your fingertips,

21
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:21,395
in extremely high-definition detail.

22
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:24,312
The diversity of the content
is what's amazing.

23
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,505
If we just had European paintings,

24
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,260
if we just had modern art,

25
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:30,086
I think it gets a bit boring.

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,969
For example, this month,
we launched the "Black History" channel

27
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,582
with 82 curated exhibitions,

28
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:40,172
which talk about arts and culture
in that community.

29
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:43,819
We also have some
amazing objects from Japan,

30
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:47,947
centered around craftsmanship,
called "Made in Japan."

31
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:51,098
And one of my favorite exhibitions,

32
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:53,527
which actually is the idea of my talk,

33
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,414
is -- I didn't expect to become
a fan of Japanese dolls.

34
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,602
But I am, thanks to this exhibition,

35
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:04,111
that has really taught me
about the craftsmanship

36
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,257
behind the soul of a Japanese doll.

37
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,509
Trust me, it's very exciting.

38
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,881
Take my word for it.

39
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,914
So, moving on swiftly.

40
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,770
One quick thing I wanted
to showcase in this platform,

41
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,729
which you can share with your kids
and your friends right now,

42
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:22,009
is you can travel to all these
amazing institutions virtually, as well.

43
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,619
One of our recent ideas was with
The Guggenheim Museum in New York,

44
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:29,001
where you can get a taste
of what it might feel like

45
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,176
to actually be there.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,967
You can go to the ground floor

47
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:34,680
and obviously, most of you,
I assume, have been there.

48
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,441
And you can see the architectural
masterpiece that it is.

49
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:40,559
But imagine this accessibility
for a kid in Bombay

50
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,303
who's studying architecture,

51
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:45,382
who hasn't had a chance
to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

52
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:48,491
You can obviously look at objects
in the Guggenheim Museum,

53
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,233
you can obviously get into them
and so on and so forth.

54
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,132
There's a lot of information here.

55
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:57,005
But this is not the purpose
of my talk today.

56
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,309
This exists right now.

57
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,259
What we now have are the building blocks
to a very exciting future,

58
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,998
when it comes to arts and culture

59
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,633
and accessibility to arts and culture.

60
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:12,125
So I am joined today onstage
by my good friend and artist in residence

61
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,492
at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,

62
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,645
who is the professor of interactive design

63
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:19,306
at ECAL University
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,944
What Cyril and our team
of engineers have been doing

65
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,103
is trying to find these connections
and visualize a few of these.

66
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,940
So I'm going to go quite quick now.

67
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:30,566
This object you see
behind me -- oh, just clarification:

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,541
Always, seeing the real thing is better.

69
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:35,428
In case people think
I'm trying to replicate the real thing.

70
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:36,659
So, moving on.

71
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:40,671
This object you see behind me
is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.

72
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,771
It's one of the oldest
objects in the world,

73
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:45,969
found in the Golan Heights
around 233,000 years ago,

74
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,122
and currently residing
at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

75
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,767
It is also one of the oldest
objects on our platform.

76
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,668
So let's zoom.

77
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,457
We start from this one object.

78
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,522
What if we zoomed out

79
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:03,052
and actually tried to experience
our own cultural big bang?

80
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,654
What might that look like?

81
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:09,131
This is what we deal with on a daily basis
at the Cultural Institute --

82
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:14,117
over six million cultural artifacts
curated and given to us by institutions,

83
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,087
to actually make these connections.

84
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,510
You can travel through time,

85
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:21,045
you can understand more
about our society through these.

86
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:25,469
You can look at it
from the perspective of our planet,

87
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:28,128
and try to see how
it might look without borders,

88
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:30,823
if we just organized art and culture.

89
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,075
We can also then plot it by time,

90
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,179
which obviously, for the data geek
in me, is very fascinating.

91
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:40,589
You can spend hours
looking at every decade

92
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,929
and the contributions
in that decade and in those years

93
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,286
for art, history and cultures.

94
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,689
We would love to spend hours
showing you each and every decade,

95
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,574
but we don't have the time right now.

96
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:54,857
So you can go on your phone
and actually do it yourself.

97
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,343
(Applause)

98
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,469
But if you don't mind
and can hold your applause till later,

99
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,041
I don't want to run out of time,

100
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:05,264
because I want to show you
a lot of cool stuff.

101
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,788
So, just very quickly:

102
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:10,798
you can move on from here
to another very interesting idea.

103
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,533
Beyond the pretty picture,

104
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,346
beyond the nice visualization,

105
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,697
what is the purpose, how is this useful?

106
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:21,450
This next idea comes
from discussions with curators

107
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:23,109
that we've been having at museums,

108
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,156
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,

109
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,374
because they dedicate their whole life
to try to tell these stories.

110
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:31,329
One of the curators told me,
"Amit, what would it be like

111
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:33,832
if you could create
a virtual curator's table

112
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,159
where all these six million objects

113
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:40,586
are displayed in a way for us
to look at the connections between them?"

114
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,639
You can spend a lot of time, trust me,
looking at different objects

115
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:46,616
and understanding where they come from.

116
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,848
It's a crazy Matrix experience.

117
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,886
(Laughter)

118
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,196
Just moving on,

119
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,391
let's take the world-famous
Vincent Van Gogh,

120
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:58,130
who is very well-represented
on this platform.

121
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,930
Thanks to the diversity
of the institutions we have,

122
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:06,658
we have over 211 high-definition,
amazing artworks by this artist,

123
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:10,429
now organized in one beautiful view.

124
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,426
And as it resolves,
and as Cyril goes deeper,

125
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,659
you can see all the self-portraits,

126
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,108
you can see still life.

127
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,735
But I just wanted to highlight
one very quick example,

128
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,447
which is very timely:

129
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,782
"The Bedroom."

130
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:25,107
This is an artwork
where three copies exist --

131
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,461
one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,

132
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,472
one at the Orsay in Paris

133
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:31,430
and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,

134
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:33,957
which, actually, currently
is hosting a reunion

135
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,756
of all three artworks physically,

136
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,917
I think only for the second time ever.

137
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:42,860
But, it is united digitally and virtually
for anybody to look at

138
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,805
in a very different way,

139
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:47,862
and you won't get pushed
in the line in the crowd.

140
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:52,628
So let's take you and let's travel
through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

141
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:56,239
so you can experience what we are doing
for every single object.

142
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:59,714
We want the image to speak
as much as it can

143
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,382
on a digital platform.

144
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:04,553
And all you need is an internet
connection and a computer

145
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:08,915
(Applause)

146
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,497
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

147
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,005
I'm sorry, this is all live,

148
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,464
so you have to give Cyril
a little bit of --

149
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,461
and this is available for every object:

150
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,200
modern art, contemporary art,
Renaissance -- you name it,

151
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,411
even sculpture.

152
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:27,397
Sometimes, you don't know
what can attract you

153
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:32,649
to an artwork or to a museum
or to a cultural discovery.

154
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:35,415
So for me, personally,
it was quite a challenge

155
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,661
because when I decided to make this
my full-time job at Google,

156
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:41,288
my mother was not very supportive.

157
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:42,559
I love my mother,

158
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,582
but she thought I was wasting my life
with this museum stuff.

159
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,918
And for her, a museum is what
you do when you go on vacation

160
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,909
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?

161
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,464
And it took around four and a half years

162
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,702
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother

163
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,379
that actually, this is worthwhile.

164
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:00,844
And the way I did it was,
I realized one day that she loves gold.

165
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:06,443
So I started showing her all objects
that have the material gold in them.

166
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,118
And the first thing my mom asks me is,

167
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:11,570
"How can we buy these?"

168
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,412
(Laughter)

169
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:16,578
And obviously, my salary is not that high,

170
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,980
so I was like, "We can't
actually do that, mom.

171
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:21,115
But you can explore them virtually."

172
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,558
And so now my mom -- every time
I meet her, she asks me,

173
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,048
"Any more gold, any more silver
in your project? Can you show me?"

174
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,246
And that's the idea
I'm trying to illustrate.

175
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,408
It does not matter how you get in,

176
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:33,794
as long as you get in.

177
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,428
Once you get in, you're hooked.

178
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:37,801
Moving on from here very quickly,

179
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,674
there is kind of a playful idea, actually,

180
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,333
to illustrate the point of access,

181
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,779
and I'm going to go
quite quickly on this one.

182
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:50,210
We all know that seeing the artwork
in person is amazing.

183
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:52,817
But we also know
that most of us can't do it,

184
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:55,599
and the ones that can afford
to do it, it's complicated.

185
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:59,430
So -- Cyril, can we load
up our art trip, what do we call it?

186
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,216
We don't have a good name for this.

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,211
But essentially, we have
around 1,000 amazing institutions,

188
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,402
68 countries.

189
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,126
But let's start with Rembrandt.

190
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,392
We might have time for only one example.

191
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,645
But thanks to the diversity,

192
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,573
we've got around 500 amazing
Rembrandt object artworks

193
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,866
from 46 institutions and 17 countries.

194
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,442
Let's say that on your next vacation,

195
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,516
you want to go see
every single one of them.

196
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,874
That is your itinerary,

197
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,552
you will probably travel
53,000 kilometers,

198
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:32,163
visit around, I think, 46 institutions,

199
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:36,378
and just FYI, you might release
10 tons of CO2 emissions.

200
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:37,865
(Laughter)

201
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,362
But remember, it's art,

202
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,051
so you can justify it,
perhaps, in some way.

203
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:44,759
Moving on swiftly from here,

204
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,718
is something a little bit
more technical and more interesting.

205
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:52,679
All that we've shown you so far
uses metadata to make the connections.

206
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:54,813
But obviously we have
something cool nowadays

207
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,749
that everyone likes to talk about,
which is machine learning.

208
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,847
So what we thought is,
let's strip out all the metadata,

209
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,483
let's look at what machine learning can do

210
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:08,830
based purely on visual recognition
of this entire collection.

211
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:13,047
What we ended up with
is this very interesting map,

212
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,381
these clusters that have
no reference point information,

213
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:21,370
but has just used visuals
to cluster things together.

214
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:24,976
Each cluster is an art to us
by itself of discovery.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,663
But one of the clusters we want
to show you very quickly

216
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,339
is this amazing cluster of portraits

217
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,765
that we found from museums
around the world.

218
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,972
If you could zoom in
a little bit more, Cyril.

219
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:38,828
Just to show you, you can
just travel through portraits.

220
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,626
And essentially, you can do nature,
you can do horses

221
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,406
and clusters galore.

222
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,857
When we saw all these portraits,

223
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:49,533
we were like, "Hey, can we do
something fun for kids,

224
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,239
or can we do something playful

225
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,288
to get people interested in portraits?"

226
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,492
Because I haven't really seen

227
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:58,883
young kids really excited
to go to a portrait gallery.

228
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,289
I wanted to try to figure something out.

229
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,780
So we created something
called the portrait matcher.

230
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,121
It's quite self-explanatory,

231
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,883
so I'm just going to let Cyril
show his beautiful face.

232
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:12,039
And essentially what's happening is,
with the movement of his head,

233
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:16,230
we are matching different portraits
around the world from museums.

234
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,450
(Applause)

235
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:31,151
And I don't know about you,

236
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,191
but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,

237
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,064
and the reaction is just phenomenal.

238
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,794
All they ask me is,
"When can we go see this?"

239
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,065
And by the way, if we're nice,

240
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,910
maybe, Cyril, you can smile
and find a happy one?

241
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,094
Oh, perfect.

242
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:48,106
By the way, this is not rehearsed.

243
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,054
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.

244
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,554
OK, let's move on; otherwise,
this will just take the whole time.

245
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,296
(Applause)

246
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,900
So, art and culture
can be fun also, right?

247
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,297
For our last quick experiment --

248
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,084
we call all of these "experiments" --

249
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,997
our last quick experiment
comes back to machine learning.

250
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,862
We show you clusters, visual clusters,

251
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:15,787
but what if we could ask the machine
to also name these clusters?

252
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:20,564
What if it could automatically tag
them, using no actual metadata?

253
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:24,688
So what we have is this kind of explorer,

254
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:28,323
where we have managed to match,
I think, around 4,000 labels.

255
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,511
And we haven't really
done anything special here,

256
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,193
just fed the collection.

257
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,987
And we found interesting categories.

258
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,916
We can start with horses,
a very straightforward category.

259
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,239
You would expect to see
that the machine has put

260
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:42,004
images of horses, right?

261
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,470
And it has, but you also notice,
right over there,

262
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:47,573
that it has a very abstract image

263
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:50,792
that it has still managed to recognize
and cluster as horses.

264
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:54,506
We also have an amazing head
in terms of a horse.

265
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,532
And each one has the tags
as to why it got categorized in this.

266
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:02,530
So let's move to another one
which I found very funny and interesting,

267
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,045
because I don't understand
how this category came up.

268
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,819
It's called "Lady in Waiting."

269
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:09,455
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,

270
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:13,021
you will see that we have
these amazing images

271
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,806
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.

272
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,276
I don't really understand it.

273
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,540
But I've been trying to ask
my museum contacts,

274
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,809
you know, "What is this?
What's going on here?"

275
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,445
And it's fascinating.

276
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,158
Coming back to gold very quickly,

277
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,745
I wanted to search for gold

278
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,871
and see how the machine
tagged all the gold.

279
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,975
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.

280
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,835
We are living in popular times.

281
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,962
It tags it as "bling-bling."

282
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:37,800
(Laughter)

283
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,121
I'm being hard on Cyril,
because I'm moving too fast.

284
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,772
Essentially, here you have
all the bling-bling

285
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:47,957
of the world's museums organized for you.

286
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,497
And finally, to end this talk
and these experiments,

287
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,838
what I hope you feel after this talk
is happiness and emotion.

288
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:57,301
And what would we see
when we see happiness?

289
00:13:57,325 --> 00:14:00,484
If we actually look at all the objects

290
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,452
that have been tagged under "happiness,"

291
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,540
you would expect happiness, I guess.

292
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:11,667
But there was one that came up
that was very fascinating and interesting,

293
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:16,066
which was this artwork
by Douglas Coupland,

294
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,185
our friend and artist
in residence as well,

295
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,470
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."

296
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:24,109
I don't know why the machine feels like
it misses its pre-Internet brain

297
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,403
and it's been tagged here,

298
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,341
but it's a very interesting thought.

299
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,548
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,

300
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:32,572
but not when it comes to exploring
arts and culture online.

301
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,909
So take out your phones,
take out your computers,

302
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,090
go visit museums.

303
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:38,793
And just a quick call-out
to all the amazing archivists,

304
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,201
historians, curators,

305
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:42,997
who are sitting in museums,
preserving all this culture.

306
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:46,339
And the least we can do is get
our daily dose of art and culture

307
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,694
for ourselves and our kids.

308
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:48,871
Thank you.

309
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:59,536
(Applause)
