00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:16,682
Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago,
I got a call from a woman in Texas,

1
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,354
Stacey Baker,

2
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:22,116
and she'd seen some of my photographs
in an art exhibition

3
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:26,852
and was wondering if she could commission
me to take a portrait of her parents.

4
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:31,335
Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey,
and I thought this was some sort of

5
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:35,367
wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,

6
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,242
but it was only later that I found out

7
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:40,449
she'd actually taken out a loan
to make this happen.

8
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,076
I took the picture of her parents,

9
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,074
but I was actually more excited
about photographing Stacey.

10
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,832
The picture I made that day

11
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,946
ended up becoming
one of my best-known portraits.

12
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:57,031
At the time I made this picture,
Stacey was working as an attorney

13
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:58,686
for the State of Texas.

14
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:03,386
Not long after, she left her job
to study photography in Maine,

15
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,651
and while she was there,
she ended up meeting

16
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,786
the director of photography
at the New York Times Magazine

17
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:12,153
and was actually offered a job.

18
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:14,982
Stacey Baker: In the years since,
Alec and I have done

19
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,214
a number of magazine projects together,

20
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,165
and we've become friends.

21
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:23,948
A few months ago, I started talking
to Alec about a fascination of mine.

22
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:27,338
I've always been obsessed
with how couples meet.

23
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,310
I asked Alec how he
and his wife Rachel met,

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,166
and he told me the story
of a high school football game

25
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,091
where she was 16 and he was 15,

26
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,181
and he asked her out.

27
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,015
He liked her purple hair.

28
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:43,173
She said yes, and that was it.

29
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:47,469
I then asked Alec if he'd be interested
in doing a photography project

30
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,280
exploring this question.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,320
AS: And I was interested in the question,
but I was actually much more interested

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,796
in Stacey's motivation for asking it,

33
00:01:56,796 --> 00:02:00,727
particularly since I'd never known
Stacey to have a boyfriend.

34
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:03,513
So as part of this project,
I thought it'd be interesting

35
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,626
if she tried to meet someone.

36
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,471
So my idea was to have Stacey here
go speed dating

37
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:14,542
in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.

38
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:20,463
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)

39
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:25,664
SB: We ended up at what was advertised
as the world's largest speed dating event.

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,684
I had 19 dates

41
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,679
and each date lasted three minutes.

42
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:34,616
Participants were given a list of ice-
breaker questions to get the ball rolling,

43
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:38,563
things like, "If you could be any kind
of animal, what would you be?"

44
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,444
That sort of thing.

45
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,858
My first date was Colin.

46
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,669
He's from England,

47
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,824
and he once married a woman he met
after placing an ad for a Capricorn.

48
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,169
Alec and I saw him
at the end of the evening,

49
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,092
and he said he'd kissed a woman in line
at one of the concession stands.

50
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:00,398
Zack and Chris came
to the date-a-thon together.

51
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,239
This is Carl.

52
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,663
I asked Carl, "What's the first thing
you notice about a woman?"

53
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,753
He said, "Tits."

54
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:15,190
(Laughter)

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,554
Matthew is attracted to women
with muscular calves.

56
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:24,385
We talked about running. He does
triathlons, I run half-marathons.

57
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:29,238
Alec actually liked his eyes and asked
if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,

58
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:32,219
and I don't think he was
attracted to me either.

59
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,715
Austin and Mike came together.

60
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,338
Mike asked me a hypothetical question.

61
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:43,959
He said, "You're in an elevator
running late for a meeting.

62
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,397
Someone makes a dash for the elevator.

63
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:49,346
Do you hold it open for them?"

64
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,343
And I said I would not.

65
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,926
(Laughter)

66
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,818
Cliff said the first thing he notices
about a woman is her teeth,

67
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,813
and we complimented each other's teeth.

68
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:05,181
Because he's an open mouth sleeper,

69
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:09,384
he says he has to floss more
to help prevent gum disease,

70
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,799
and so I asked him how often he flosses,

71
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,399
and he said, "Every other day."

72
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,214
(Laughter)

73
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,972
Now, as someone who flosses twice a day,

74
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,372
I wasn't really sure that
that was flossing more

75
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:24,894
but I don't think I said that out loud.

76
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,936
Bill is an auditor,

77
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:33,419
and we talked the entire three minutes
about auditing. (Laughter)

78
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,640
The first thing Spencer notices
about a woman is her complexion.

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,333
He feels a lot of women
wear too much makeup,

80
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,164
and that they should only wear enough
to accentuate the features that they have.

81
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,231
I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all

82
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,249
and he seemed to think
that that was a good thing.

83
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,404
Craig told me he didn't think
I was willing to be vulnerable.

84
00:04:55,404 --> 00:05:00,466
He was also frustrated when I couldn't
remember my most embarrassing moment.

85
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,768
He thought I was lying, but I wasn't.

86
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,852
I didn't think he liked me at all,
but at the end of the night,

87
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:09,173
he came back to me and he gave me
a box of chocolates.

88
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:12,540
William was really difficult to talk to.

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,676
I think he was drunk.

90
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:17,111
(Laughter)

91
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,875
Actor Chris McKenna
was the MC of the event.

92
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,336
He used to be on
"The Young and the Restless."

93
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,076
I didn't actually go on a date with him.

94
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,621
Alec said he saw several women
give their phone numbers to him.

95
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,620
Needless to say, I didn't fall in love.

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,614
I didn't feel a particular connection with
any of the men that I went on dates with,

97
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:44,262
and I didn't feel like they felt
a particular connection with me either.

98
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:48,043
AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --

99
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:53,626
(Laughter) -- as a photographer
is the quality of vulnerability.

100
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:57,330
The physical exterior reveals a crack
in which you can get a glimpse

101
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,511
at a more fragile interior.

102
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,878
At this date-a-thon event,
I saw so many examples of that,

103
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:08,499
but as I watched Stacey's dates
and talked to her about them,

104
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:14,512
I realized how different
photographic love is from real love.

105
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:18,162
What is real love? How does it work?

106
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:22,504
In order to work on this question
and to figure out how someone goes

107
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:27,078
from meeting on a date
to having a life together,

108
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,632
Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,

109
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:33,769
which is the largest
retirement community in Las Vegas.

110
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,638
Our contact there was George,
who runs the community's photography club.

111
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,447
He arranged for us to meet other couples
in their makeshift photo studio.

112
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,515
SB: After 45 years of marriage,
Anastasia's husband died two years ago,

113
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:52,667
so we asked if she had
an old wedding picture.

114
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:56,080
She met her husband
when she was a 15-year-old waitress

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,565
at a small barbecue place in Michigan.

116
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,237
He was 30.

117
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,512
She'd lied about her age.

118
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:05,321
He was the first person she'd dated.

119
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:09,780
Dean had been named photographer of
the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,660
and this caught Alec's attention,

121
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,238
as did the fact
that he met his wife, Judy,

122
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:17,767
at the same age when Alec met Rachel.

123
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,739
Dean admitted that he likes
to look at beautiful women,

124
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,686
but he's never questioned
his decision to marry Judy.

125
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:27,054
AS: George met Josephine
at a parish dance.

126
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,562
He was 18, she was 15.

127
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:33,115
Like a lot of the couples we met,
they weren't especially philosophical

128
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,460
about their early choices.

129
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,041
George said something
that really stuck with me.

130
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:43,565
He said, "When you get that feeling,
you just go with it."

131
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:49,675
Bob and Trudy met on a blind date
when she was still in high school.

132
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,445
They said they weren't particularly
attracted to each other

133
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:53,865
when the first met.

134
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,543
Nevertheless, they were
married soon after.

135
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:59,528
SB: The story that stayed with me the most

136
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:04,265
was that of George, the photography club
president, and his wife, Mary.

137
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,655
This was George and Mary's
second marriage.

138
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:12,345
They met at a country-western club
in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.

139
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:16,083
He was there alone drinking
and she was with friends.

140
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:21,795
When they started dating,
he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,

141
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,326
and she offered to help him
get out of debt,

142
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:28,296
so for the next year, he turned
his paychecks over to Mary,

143
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,804
and she got him out of debt.

144
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:35,239
George was actually an alcoholic
when they married, and Mary knew it.

145
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,072
At some point in their marriage,
he says he consumed

146
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:41,601
54 beers in one day.

147
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,434
Another time, when he was drunk,
he threatened to kill Mary

148
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,966
and her two kids,

149
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:50,412
but they escaped and a SWAT team
was called to the house.

150
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,583
Amazingly, Mary took him back,

151
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,905
and eventually things got better.

152
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,761
George has been involved
in Alcoholics Anonymous

153
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,664
and hasn't had a drink in 36 years.

154
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:01,778
(Music)

155
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:04,125
At the end of the day,
after we left Sun City,

156
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,539
I told Alec that I didn't actually think

157
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,672
that the stories of how these couples met
were all that interesting.

158
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,878
What was more interesting

159
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:16,593
was how they managed to stay together.

160
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:20,773
AS: They all had this beautiful
quality of endurance,

161
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,048
but that was true of the singles, too.

162
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:26,856
The world is hard,
and the singles were out there

163
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,201
trying to connect with other people,

164
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,825
and the couples
were holding onto each other

165
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,592
after all these decades.

166
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,151
My favorite pictures on this trip
were of Joe and Roseanne.

167
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,395
Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,

168
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:46,906
we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
if they had an old wedding photograph.

169
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:51,712
In their case, they simultaneously
pulled out of their wallets

170
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:56,008
the exact same photograph.

171
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:59,142
What's more beautiful,
I thought to myself,

172
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:03,438
this image of a young couple
who has just fallen in love

173
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:08,644
or the idea of these two people
holding onto this image for decades?

174
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,122
Thank you.

175
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:17,532
(Applause)
