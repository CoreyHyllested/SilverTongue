0
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,460
Thousands of years from now,

1
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:18,325
we'll look back at the first
century of computing

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,398
as a fascinating but very peculiar time --

3
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:28,102
the only time in history where humans
were reduced to live in 2D space,

4
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:32,045
interacting with technology
as if we were machines;

5
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:37,286
a singular, 100-year period
in the vastness of time

6
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,998
where humans communicated,

7
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:42,673
were entertained and managed their lives

8
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,371
from behind a screen.

9
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:49,976
Today, we spend most of our time
tapping and looking at screens.

10
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:54,349
What happened to interacting
with each other?

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,711
I don't know about you, but I feel limited

12
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:01,283
inside this 2D world
of monitors and pixels.

13
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,816
And it is this very limitation

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,256
and my desire to connect with people

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,268
that inspires me as a creator.

16
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:11,643
Put simply: I want
to create a new reality,

17
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:17,374
a reality where technology brings
us infinitely closer to each other,

18
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:20,588
a reality where people, not devices,

19
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,080
are the center of everything.

20
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:29,177
I dream of a reality where technology
senses what we see, touch and feel;

21
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:33,035
a reality where technology
no longer gets in our way,

22
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,804
but instead embraces who we are.

23
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:37,932
I dream of technology

24
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:40,447
on a human path.

25
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,886
We have all experienced technology

26
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,212
that enables people
to act more like people,

27
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:51,013
products that enable natural interactions,
voice controls or biometrics.

28
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:58,624
This is the next step in the evolution.

29
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,285
This is Microsoft HoloLens,

30
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:04,882
the first fully untethered
holographic computer.

31
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:09,837
Devices like this will bring
3D holographic content

32
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,780
right into our world,

33
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:13,861
enhancing the way we experience life

34
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:16,598
beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.

35
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:21,257
Now, I'm not thinking
about a distant future.

36
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,458
I'm talking about today.

37
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,102
We are already seeing
car companies like Volvo

38
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:30,053
designing cars differently with HoloLens;

39
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:34,808
universities like Case Western
redefining the way medical students learn;

40
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,252
and my personal favorite,

41
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:42,091
NASA is using HoloLens
to let scientists explore planets

42
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,345
holographically.

43
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,218
Now, this is important.

44
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,636
By bringing holograms into our world,

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,285
I'm not just talking about a new device
or a better computer.

46
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:57,801
I'm talking about freeing ourselves
from the 2D confines

47
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:00,308
of traditional computing.

48
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,937
Put it this way:

49
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:07,181
temporally adjusted, we're like
cave people in computer terms.

50
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:09,792
We've barely discovered charcoal

51
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:13,996
and started drawing
the first stick figures in our cave.

52
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:19,250
Now, this is the perspective
I apply to my work every single day.

53
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,967
And now for the next few minutes,

54
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:26,290
I invite all of you to apply
the same perspective

55
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:27,707
to the journey ahead of us.

56
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,381
Now, as I put this HoloLens on,

57
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,584
let me explain the setup a little bit.

58
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:41,980
It's probably the most risky demo
we have ever done on any stage

59
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,238
with HoloLens,

60
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:46,562
and I can't think of a better place
to do it than here at TED.

61
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:50,995
Momentarily, I am going
to be seeing holograms

62
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,341
right on this stage,

63
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,621
just as clearly as I can see all of you.

64
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:58,283
Now at the same time,
we have also this special camera

65
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,003
that just walked in onstage

66
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:03,259
so that all of you can share
in this experience with me

67
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,695
up on all the monitors.

68
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,272
So let's start our journey.

69
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,732
And what better place
to begin our journey,

70
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:12,859
than in the computer cave of 2D.

71
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:19,169
Let's explore the world
all around us with this new lens,

72
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,607
and understand the computer world
from a brand new perspective.

73
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:28,123
The computer universe
is both marvelous and primitive.

74
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,548
It's a universe based on causality.

75
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:35,280
As developers, we dream
the different causes

76
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,580
and then we program the different effects.

77
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,965
Double click on an icon, that's a cause.

78
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,243
Open an application, that's an effect.

79
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:49,511
Now when we compare this
to our physical universe,

80
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,550
it is overly constraining,

81
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,018
because our universe is not digital.

82
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:56,638
Our universe is analog.

83
00:04:56,662 --> 00:05:00,777
Our universe doesn't think
in terms of zero or one,

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,979
true or false, or black or white.

85
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:08,909
We exist in a world
governed by quantum physics,

86
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,276
a universe of zero and one
both at the same time,

87
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,392
a reality based on infinite
probabilities and shades of gray.

88
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:22,946
You can see how these two worlds collide.

89
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:29,051
So why are screens so pervasive
in our analog life?

90
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,967
We see screens from the moment we wake up,

91
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,672
to the moment we fall asleep.

92
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,334
Why?

93
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,821
I think it's because computers
give us superpowers.

94
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:44,099
Within the digital universe,
we have the power to displace space

95
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:45,874
and the power to displace time.

96
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:49,717
It doesn't matter if you're using
technology for entertainment,

97
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,966
productivity or communication.

98
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,861
Think of it this way:

99
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,265
let's all go home tonight

100
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,955
and watch our favorite show on television.

101
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:02,004
This is theater -- time
and space displaced.

102
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,734
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,

103
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:08,075
I'm going to immediately call
my lovely family in Seattle.

104
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,142
That's displacement of space.

105
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,311
Now, these are such great superpowers

106
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,284
that we put up with
the two-dimensional limitations

107
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,097
of our current digital world.

108
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,636
But what if we didn't have to?

109
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,360
What if we could have
these same digital powers

110
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,005
in our world?

111
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,362
You can already see glimmers of this,

112
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:35,038
but I believe our children's children

113
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,005
will grow up in a world
devoid of 2D technology.

114
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,494
It's remarkable to dream of this world,

115
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:46,707
a world where technology
truly understands us --

116
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,261
where we live, work and communicate --

117
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:52,407
with tools that enhance
the human experience,

118
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:56,618
not machines that limit our humanity.

119
00:06:58,642 --> 00:06:59,896
So how do we get there?

120
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:05,272
For me, the answer required
looking at the problem

121
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,771
from a different perspective.

122
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,736
It required sensing the world
from the perspective of a machine.

123
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:18,031
If you're a machine trying
to sense our world,

124
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,359
how would you actually
break the problem down?

125
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:23,832
You'd probably try to classify things

126
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,021
as a human,

127
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,380
an environment

128
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,189
or an object.

129
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:36,202
But how would that machine
then interact with reality?

130
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,688
And I can think of three ways.

131
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:40,878
First, as a machine,

132
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:44,820
I would observe or I would input reality.

133
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,529
Speech recognition
and biometric authentication

134
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,813
are great examples of a machine
interacting with humans

135
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,552
from an input perspective.

136
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,772
Secondly, as a machine,

137
00:07:56,796 --> 00:08:01,907
I could place digital information,
or output information,

138
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,096
into reality.

139
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,611
Holograms are examples of a machine
interacting with an environment

140
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,095
from an output perspective.

141
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,086
Finally, as a machine,

142
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,642
I could exchange energy
with the world via haptics.

143
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,392
Now, imagine being able to feel
the temperature of a virtual object,

144
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,635
or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram

145
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,492
and having it push you back
with equal force.

146
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:30,676
With this perspective,

147
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:36,148
we are able to collapse reality
into a simple matrix.

148
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,323
Now here's a secret:

149
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,405
as an engineer, I get really excited

150
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,283
anytime I can reduce
something to the matrix.

151
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,822
From self-driving cars

152
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:46,435
to smartphones

153
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,781
to this holographic computer on my head,

154
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:52,587
machines are becoming capable
of understanding our world.

155
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,828
And they are starting to interact with us

156
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,967
in significantly more personal ways.

157
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:03,822
Now, imagine having granular control

158
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:05,682
over everything in the world.

159
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,465
Move the dial one way,

160
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,145
and you get reality.

161
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,351
Move the dial the other way,

162
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:20,103
and you get virtual reality.

163
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:26,839
Now, imagine dialing
your entire environment

164
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,996
between virtual and real worlds.

165
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:35,877
I love it down here.

166
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:40,130
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you

167
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:43,564
and dial from real humans into elves.

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,524
When technology truly
understands our world,

169
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:51,195
it will again transform
the ways we interact,

170
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,147
the ways we work and the ways we play.

171
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:00,949
Less than half a century ago,

172
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:03,877
two courageous men landed on the moon,

173
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:08,507
using computers that were less powerful
than the phones in your pockets.

174
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,221
Six hundred million humans watched them

175
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,008
on grainy, black-and-white televisions.

176
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:16,737
And the world?

177
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,491
The world was mesmerized.

178
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,356
Now imagine how our children
and their children

179
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,523
will experience the continued
exploration of space

180
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:32,498
with technology
that understands this world.

181
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:37,689
We already live in a world where
real-time universal translators exist.

182
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:43,309
And I can squint, and I can already
see holographic telepresence

183
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,507
in our near future.

184
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,158
In fact, since we've been lucky
with our demo so far,

185
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,491
let's try doing something else
even more crazy.

186
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,906
I invite you to experience,

187
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,967
for the first time anywhere in the world,

188
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,476
here on the TED stage,

189
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,818
a real-life holographic teleportation,

190
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:07,660
between me and my friend,
Dr. Jeffrey Norris,

191
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,482
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

192
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,540
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.

193
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,680
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.

194
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:18,807
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.
How are you doing today, Jeff?

195
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,934
(Applause)

196
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,022
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.

197
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:26,498
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,
Jeff, about where you are?

198
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,198
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.

199
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,103
I'm standing in a room across the street,

200
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,131
while I'm standing on this stage with you,

201
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,957
while I'm standing on Mars,
a hundred million miles away.

202
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,673
AK: Wow, a hundred million
miles away. This is crazy!

203
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:48,483
Can you tell us a little bit more
about where all this data

204
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,196
from Mars is coming from?

205
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,457
JN: Absolutely.

206
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:57,567
This is a precise
holographic replica of Mars,

207
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,771
built from data captured
by the Curiosity Mars Rover,

208
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,850
that I can explore as easily
as a place on Earth.

209
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:08,310
Humans are natural explorers.

210
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,895
We can instantly
understand an environment,

211
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,666
just by being present in it.

212
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,793
We've built tools like our Mars Rover

213
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:19,417
to extend our vision
and lengthen our reach.

214
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,552
But for decades,

215
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:25,541
we've explored from a seat
behind screens and keyboards.

216
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,628
Now, we're leaping over all of that,

217
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,855
over the giant antennas
and the relay satellites

218
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,154
and the vastness between worlds

219
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:40,286
to take our first steps on this landscape
as if we were truly there.

220
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,090
Today, a group of scientists
on our mission

221
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:47,498
are seeing Mars as never before --

222
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:50,839
an alien world made
a little more familiar,

223
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:54,418
because they're finally exploring it
as humans should.

224
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:59,911
But our dreams don't have to end
with making it just like being there.

225
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,349
When we dial this real world
to the virtual,

226
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,672
we can do magical things.

227
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,483
We can see in invisible wavelengths

228
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:10,292
or teleport to the top of a mountain.

229
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:15,447
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals
in a rock just by touching it.

230
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,661
We're taking the first steps.

231
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:22,927
But we want the whole world
to join us in taking the next,

232
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,714
because this is not a journey for a few,

233
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,253
but for all of us.

234
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,225
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.

235
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,986
Thank you so much for joining us
on the TED stage today.

236
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:39,723
(Applause)

237
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:42,459
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.

238
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:43,656
AK: Bye, Jeff.

239
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:56,866
(Applause)

240
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:01,121
I dream about this future

241
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,873
every single day.

242
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,831
I take inspiration from our ancestors.

243
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:09,380
We used to live in tribes
where we interacted,

244
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,800
communicated and worked together.

245
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,502
We are all beginning to build technology
that will enable us to return

246
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:20,849
to the humanity that brought us
where we are today --

247
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,536
technology that will let us stop living
inside this 2D world

248
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,568
of monitors and pixels,

249
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:33,339
and let us start remembering
what it feels like

250
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:36,949
to live in our 3D world.

251
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:41,526
It's a phenomenal time to be human.

252
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,320
Thank you.

253
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:48,413
(Applause)

254
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,934
Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
I have some questions.

255
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,109
AK: OK.

256
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,555
HW: So there's been
some talk in the press.

257
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:57,605
And I'll just ask you straight,
then we have a straight answer.

258
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,311
There's been talk about the difference
between the demos

259
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,517
and the reality of the commercial product.

260
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,492
Talk about this field of view issue.

261
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:08,835
Is this type of experience what someone
who buys the product will get?

262
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,818
AK: It's a great question,

263
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:13,493
Or, said better, this is a question
we've been receiving

264
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:16,180
in the media for possibly the last year.

265
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:18,951
If you do your research,
I haven't answered that question.

266
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:20,381
I've purposely ignored it,

267
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:22,919
because ultimately,
it's the wrong question to ask.

268
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:29,959
That's the equivalent of me showing
holograms to someone for the first time,

269
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:33,793
and you then saying,
"What's the size of your television?"

270
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:36,511
The field of view for the product
is almost irrelevant.

271
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,033
What we should be talking about
is the density of lights,

272
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,843
or radiance, that shows up.

273
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,238
Better said, what the angular resolution
is of the things that you see.

274
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:47,262
So from that perspective, what you saw --

275
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,349
you know, the camera
is wearing a HoloLens.

276
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,357
So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.

277
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,947
HW: But the camera has a different lens
on it than our eye. Right?

278
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,891
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.

279
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,836
It's seeing a much wider view
than the human eye is.

280
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,165
So if you think about the points of light
that show up radially

281
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,703
from the vision of the camera,

282
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:08,448
which is the thing that matters:

283
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,030
how many points of light
can I get in a given volume?

284
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,181
That's the same as I get
on this HoloLens as I will on that one.

285
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:20,186
Now, this camera sees
a much wider view of the world, right?

286
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,433
HW: Jesus Christ!

287
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:22,458
(Laughter)

288
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,561
AK: He did show up!
I told you he'd show up.

289
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,784
Come this way.

290
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,672
(Laughter)

291
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,918
HW: Oh, shit.

292
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,731
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.

293
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,817
HW: I knew something was happening,
but I really wasn't sure what.

294
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,588
AK: So in short: to be super crisp,

295
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,628
the camera that you see on the screen
has a wider field of view

296
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:41,850
than the human eye.

297
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:45,081
But the angular resolution
of the holograms that you see,

298
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:49,074
the points of light per unit of area,

299
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:50,264
are actually the same.

300
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:53,427
HW: So you spent -- Jeff,
I'll get to you in a minute --

301
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:58,031
so you spent a lot of time
mapping the stage --

302
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,405
AK: That's right.

303
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,603
HW: So help me out here:

304
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,596
if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,

305
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,557
I don't need to map my apartment, right?

306
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:08,694
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time
at about five frames per second,

307
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,119
with this technology
that we call spatial mapping.

308
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,170
So in your home, as soon as you put it on,

309
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:16,124
holograms will start showing up,
and you'll start placing them

310
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,939
and they'll start learning your home.

311
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:21,472
In a stage environment where we're trying
to get something on my head

312
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:23,647
to communicate with something over there

313
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:27,642
with all of the wireless connectivity
that usually brings all conferences down,

314
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,630
we don't take the risk
of trying to do this live.

315
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:35,081
So what we do is pre-map the stage
at five frames per second

316
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,129
with the same spatial-mapping technology

317
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,140
that you'll use with the product at home,

318
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:40,315
and then we store it,

319
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,793
so that when there's shenanigans
of wireless in an environment like this,

320
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:46,834
between the camera's HoloLens
and the one on my head,

321
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,451
we don't have things disappear.

322
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:51,904
Because ultimately, the holograms
are coming from this HoloLens,

323
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,968
and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.

324
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,917
So if I lose connectivity,

325
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,468
you would stop seeing
beautiful things on the screen.

326
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,055
HW: And it was beautiful.

327
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,254
Um ... Jeff?

328
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:03,713
JN: Yes?

329
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,028
HW: Hi.

330
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:08,794
AK: I'll take a step back.

331
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,748
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,

332
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:14,279
you were here, you were
in a room across the street.

333
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:18,505
Tell me more about the fact that,
with holograms, you have sight

334
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,230
but you don't have touch,
you don't have smell.

335
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:23,790
Is this scientifically useful now?

336
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,552
That's my question for a hologram.

337
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:28,840
JN: Thanks for the question.

338
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,377
Absolutely, I believe
that these technologies

339
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,425
are scientifically useful right now,

340
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:38,053
and that's why we're using them
in multiple parts of our work at NASA.

341
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,696
So we're using it to improve
the ways that we explore Mars.

342
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,181
We're also using it for our astronauts
on the space station.

343
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,657
We're even using it now to design

344
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,866
the next generation of our spacecraft.

345
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,868
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away.
Thank you very much.

346
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,101
(Laughter)

347
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,612
Alex, really, that was amazing.
Thank you so much.

348
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:00,794
AK: Thank you.
