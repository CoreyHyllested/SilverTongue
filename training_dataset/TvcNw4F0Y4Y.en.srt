0
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,590
How much do you get paid?

1
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,043
Don't answer that out loud.

2
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,447
But put a number in your head.

3
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:24,660
Now: How much do you think the person
sitting next to you gets paid?

4
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,335
Again, don't answer out loud.

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,461
(Laughter)

6
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:31,502
At work, how much do you think

7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:35,464
the person sitting in the cubicle
or the desk next to you gets paid?

8
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:36,643
Do you know?

9
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:38,342
Should you know?

10
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:42,938
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me
to even ask you those questions.

11
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:46,112
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.

12
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:50,518
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea
of broadcasting our salary.

13
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:52,691
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,

14
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,907
and we're definitely not supposed
to tell our office neighbors.

15
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,445
The assumed reason is that if everybody
knew what everybody got paid,

16
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,259
then all hell would break loose.

17
00:01:01,283 --> 00:01:03,384
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,

18
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,597
there might even be a few people who quit.

19
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:09,400
But what if secrecy is actually
the reason for all that strife?

20
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:12,042
And what would happen
if we removed that secrecy?

21
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,590
What if openness actually increased
the sense of fairness and collaboration

22
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:17,836
inside a company?

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,446
What would happen if we had
total pay transparency?

24
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,571
For the past several years,

25
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:26,508
I've been studying the corporate
and entrepreneurial leaders

26
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:30,081
who question the conventional wisdom
about how to run a company.

27
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:32,557
And the question of pay keeps coming up.

28
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:35,555
And the answers keep surprising.

29
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,265
It turns out that pay transparency --

30
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,399
sharing salaries openly
across a company --

31
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,072
makes for a better workplace
for both the employee

32
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,683
and for the organization.

33
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:48,461
When people don't know how their pay
compares to their peers',

34
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,301
they're more likely to feel underpaid

35
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:52,260
and maybe even discriminated against.

36
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,221
Do you want to work at a place
that tolerates the idea

37
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:58,049
that you feel underpaid
or discriminated against?

38
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:01,207
But keeping salaries secret
does exactly that,

39
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:04,114
and it's a practice
as old as it is common,

40
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,766
despite the fact
that in the United States,

41
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,240
the law protects an employee's right
to discuss their pay.

42
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,975
In one famous example from decades ago,

43
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,105
the management of Vanity Fair magazine

44
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,249
actually circulated a memo entitled:

45
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,478
"Forbidding Discussion Among
Employees of Salary Received."

46
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:24,824
"Forbidding" discussion among
employees of salary received.

47
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,629
Now that memo didn't sit well
with everybody.

48
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:29,699
New York literary figures
Dorothy Parker,

49
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,485
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,

50
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,950
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,

51
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:35,755
decided to stand up for transparency

52
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,511
and showed up for work the next day

53
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:40,749
with their salary written on signs
hanging from their neck.

54
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:42,321
(Laughter)

55
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:44,291
Imagine showing up for work

56
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,805
with your salary just written
across your chest for all to see.

57
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:52,843
But why would a company even want
to discourage salary discussions?

58
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:56,199
Why do some people go along with it,
while others revolt against it?

59
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:00,950
It turns out that in addition
to the assumed reasons,

60
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:04,277
pay secrecy is actually a way
to save a lot of money.

61
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,212
You see, keeping salaries secret

62
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,187
leads to what economists call
"information asymmetry."

63
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,482
This is a situation where,
in a negotiation,

64
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:14,504
one party has loads more
information than the other.

65
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:18,297
And in hiring or promotion
or annual raise discussions,

66
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:21,979
an employer can use that secrecy
to save a lot of money.

67
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,142
Imagine how much better
you could negotiate for a raise

68
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,973
if you knew everybody's salary.

69
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:32,053
Economists warn that information asymmetry

70
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,724
can cause markets to go awry.

71
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,654
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,

72
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,096
and suddenly everybody
is shouting at each other.

73
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,572
In fact, they even warn

74
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:45,413
that information asymmetry
can lead to a total market failure.

75
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,109
And I think we're almost there.

76
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,299
Here's why:

77
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:54,251
first, most employees have no idea
how their pay compares to their peers'.

78
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,684
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,

79
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:02,089
two-thirds of everyone who is paid
at the market rate

80
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:04,345
said that they felt they were underpaid.

81
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,915
And of everybody who felt
that they were underpaid,

82
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,892
60 percent said
that they intended to quit,

83
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,804
regardless of where they were --
underpaid, overpaid

84
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,407
or right at the market rate.

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,660
If you were part of this survey,
what would you say?

86
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:19,960
Are you underpaid?

87
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:22,309
Well, wait -- how do you even know,

88
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,466
because you're not allowed
to talk about it?

89
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,510
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,

90
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,313
makes it easier to ignore
the discrimination

91
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,804
that's already present
in the market today.

92
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:37,914
In a 2011 report from the Institute
for Women's Policy Research,

93
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,062
the gender wage gap
between men and women

94
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,824
was 23 percent.

95
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:45,070
This is where that 77 cents
on the dollar comes from.

96
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,104
But in the Federal Government,

97
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:49,191
where salaries are pinned
to certain levels

98
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,255
and everybody knows
what those levels are,

99
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,364
the gender wage gap
shrinks to 11 percent --

100
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:55,964
and this is before controlling
for any of the factors

101
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,881
that economists argue over
whether or not to control for.

102
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,936
If we really want to close
the gender wage gap,

103
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,448
maybe we should start
by opening up the payroll.

104
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:08,086
If this is what total
market failure looks like,

105
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,378
then openness remains
the only way to ensure fairness.

106
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,775
Now, I realize that letting people
know what you make

107
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,445
might feel uncomfortable,

108
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:17,984
but isn't it less uncomfortable

109
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,888
than always wondering
if you're being discriminated against,

110
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:24,674
or if your wife or your daughter
or your sister is being paid unfairly?

111
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:29,293
Openness remains the best way
to ensure fairness,

112
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,230
and pay transparency does that.

113
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,671
That's why entrepreneurial leaders
and corporate leaders

114
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:37,488
have been experimenting
with sharing salaries for years.

115
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:38,925
Like Dane Atkinson.

116
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,828
Dane is a serial entrepreneur
who started many companies

117
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,434
in a pay secrecy condition

118
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,811
and even used that condition
to pay two equally qualified people

119
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,531
dramatically different salaries,

120
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:51,724
depending on how well
they could negotiate.

121
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,422
And Dane saw the strife
that happened as a result of this.

122
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,115
So when he started
his newest company, SumAll,

123
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,249
he committed to salary transparency
from the beginning.

124
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,559
And the results have been amazing.

125
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,046
And in study after study,

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,946
when people know
how they're being paid

127
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,999
and how that pay compares to their peers',

128
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:12,956
they're more likely to work hard
to improve their performance,

129
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,829
more likely to be engaged,
and they're less likely to quit.

130
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,255
That's why Dane's not alone.

131
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,450
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

132
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:23,261
to the tens of thousands
of employees at Whole Foods,

133
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:26,452
where not only is your salary
available for everyone to see,

134
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,476
but the performance data
for the store and for your department

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,419
is available on the company intranet

136
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:32,665
for all to see.

137
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,447
Now, pay transparency
takes a lot of forms.

138
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,069
It's not one size fits all.

139
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,589
Some post their salaries for all to see.

140
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,914
Some only keep it inside the company.

141
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:45,523
Some post the formula for calculating pay,

142
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,321
and others post the pay levels

143
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,123
and affix everybody to that level.

144
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,196
So you don't have to make signs

145
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,744
for all of your employees
to wear around the office.

146
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:56,682
And you don't have to be
the only one wearing a sign

147
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:57,928
that you made at home.

148
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:01,698
But we can all take greater steps
towards pay transparency.

149
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,261
For those of you that have the authority

150
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,079
to move forward towards transparency:

151
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,578
it's time to move forward.

152
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:10,411
And for those of you
that don't have that authority:

153
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,414
it's time to stand up for your right to.

154
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,988
So how much do you get paid?

155
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,813
And how does that compare
to the people you work with?

156
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,496
You should know.

157
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:22,587
And so should they.

158
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:25,104
Thank you.

159
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:28,306
(Applause)
