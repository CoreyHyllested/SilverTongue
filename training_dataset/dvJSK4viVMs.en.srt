0
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,779
This is a story about capitalism.

1
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,567
It's a system I love

2
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:23,291
because of the successes and opportunities
it's afforded me and millions of others.

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:30,056
I started in my 20s trading commodities,
cotton in particular, in the pits,

4
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:33,682
and if there was ever a free market
free-for-all, this was it,

5
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:37,300
where men wearing ties
but acting like gladiators

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,787
fought literally
and physically for a profit.

7
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:44,360
Fortunately, I was good enough
that by the time I was 30,

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,020
I was able to move into the upstairs
world of money management,

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,572
where I spent the next three decades
as a global macro trader.

10
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,846
And over that time, I've seen
a lot of crazy things in the markets,

11
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:59,529
and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.

12
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,638
And unfortunately,

13
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:04,938
I'm sad to report that right now
we might be in the grips

14
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:08,894
of one of the most disastrous,
certainly of my career,

15
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,115
and one consistent takeaway is
manias never end well.

16
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,581
Now, over the past 50 years,

17
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:21,432
we as a society have come to view
our companies and corporations

18
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:26,238
in a very narrow, almost
monomaniacal fashion

19
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:30,255
with regard to how we value them,

20
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:33,924
and we have put
so much emphasis on profits,

21
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:36,710
on short-term quarterly
earnings and share prices,

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,550
at the exclusion of all else.

23
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,319
It's like we've ripped the humanity
out of our companies.

24
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,313
Now, we don't do that --
conveniently reduce something

25
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:51,521
to a set of numbers that you
can play with like Lego toys --

26
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:53,869
we don't do that in our individual life.

27
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,072
We don't treat somebody or value them

28
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:01,213
based on their monthly income
or their credit score,

29
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,020
but we have this double standard

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,565
when it comes to the way
that we value our businesses,

31
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:07,050
and you know what?

32
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,215
It's threatening the very
underpinnings of our society.

33
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,817
And here's how you'll see.

34
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:16,322
This chart is corporate profit margins
going back 40 years

35
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:18,400
as a percentage of revenues,

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,707
and you can see that we're
at a 40-year high of 12,5 percent.

37
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:26,259
Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,

38
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,526
but if you're the other side of that,
and you're the average American worker,

39
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,833
then you can see it's not
such a good thing.

40
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,410
["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs.
CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]

41
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,527
Now, higher profit margins
do not increase societal wealth.

42
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:45,766
What they actually do is they
exacerbate income inequality,

43
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,166
and that's not a good thing.

44
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,627
But intuitively, that makes sense, right?

45
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:54,250
Because if the top 10 percent
of American families

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,610
own 90 percent of the stocks,

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,571
as they take a greater share
of corporate profits,

48
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:03,514
then there's less wealth left
for the rest of society.

49
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,300
Again, income inequality
is not a good thing.

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,761
This next chart,
made by The Equality Trust,

51
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:13,614
shows 21 countries from Austria
to Japan to New Zealand.

52
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:16,818
On the horizontal axis
is income inequality.

53
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:20,116
The further to the right you go,
the greater the income inequality.

54
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,459
On the vertical axis
are nine social and health metrics.

55
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,222
The more you go up that,
the worse the problems are,

56
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:31,470
and those metrics include life expectancy,
teenage pregnancy, literacy,

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,210
social mobility, just to name a few.

58
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,391
Now, those of you in the audience
who are Americans may wonder,

59
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,736
well, where does the United States rank?

60
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,593
Where does it lie on that chart?

61
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:43,288
And guess what?

62
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,370
We're literally off the chart.

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,793
Yes, that's us,

64
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,952
with the greatest income inequality

65
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:54,248
and the greatest social problems,
according to those metrics.

66
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,802
Now, here's a macro forecast
that's easy to make,

67
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,401
and that's, that gap between
the wealthiest and the poorest,

68
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,421
it will get closed.

69
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:04,010
History always does it.

70
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,159
It typically happens in one of three ways:

71
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,560
either through revolution,
higher taxes, or wars.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,889
None of those are on my bucket list.

73
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,025
(Laughter)

74
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,086
Now, there's another way to do it,

75
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:22,226
and that's by increasing justness
in corporate behavior,

76
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,989
but the way that we're
operating right now,

77
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,983
that would require
a tremendous change in behavior,

78
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:32,930
and like an addict trying to kick a habit,

79
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,436
the first step is to acknowledge
that you have a problem.

80
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:40,337
And let me just say,
this profits mania that we're on

81
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,636
is so deeply entrenched

82
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:45,167
that we don't even realize
how we're harming society.

83
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:49,184
Here's a small but startling example
of exactly how we're doing that:

84
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:52,247
this chart shows corporate giving

85
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:57,632
as a percentage of profits,
not revenues, over the last 30 years.

86
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:03,401
Juxtapose that to the earlier chart
of corporate profit margins,

87
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:07,528
and I ask you, does that feel right?

88
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:11,699
In all fairness, when I
started writing this, I thought,

89
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,160
"Oh wow, what does my company,
what does Tudor do?"

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,693
And I realized we give one percent
of corporate profits

91
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,423
to charity every year.

92
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:25,324
And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.

93
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:31,623
When I realized that, I literally
wanted to throw up.

94
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,101
But the point is, this mania
is so deeply entrenched

95
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:39,263
that well-intentioned people like myself
don't even realize that we're part of it.

96
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:42,274
Now, we're not going
to change corporate behavior

97
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:47,591
by simply increasing corporate
philanthropy or charitable contributions.

98
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,725
And oh, by the way,
we've since quadrupled that,

99
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,974
but -- (Applause) -- Please.

100
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:58,713
But we can do it by driving
more just behavior.

101
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,754
And one way to do it is actually trusting

102
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,169
the system that got us
here in the first place,

103
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,282
and that's the free market system.

104
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,975
About a year ago,
some friends of mine and I

105
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:12,025
started a not-for-profit
called Just Capital.

106
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,493
Its mission is very simple:

107
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:15,988
to help companies and corporations

108
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:21,263
learn how to operate in a more just
fashion by using the public's input

109
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:27,574
to define exactly what the criteria are
for just corporate behavior.

110
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:29,989
Now, right now, there's
no widely accepted standard

111
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,331
that a company or corporation can follow,
and that's where Just Capital comes in,

112
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:39,651
because beginning this year and every year
we'll be conducting a nationwide survey

113
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:43,781
of a representative sample
of 20,000 Americans

114
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,701
to find out exactly what they think

115
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:50,579
are the criteria for justness
in corporate behavior.

116
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,591
Now, this is a model that's going
to start in the United States

117
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,226
but can be expanded
anywhere around the globe,

118
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,107
and maybe we'll find out

119
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:00,975
that the most important
thing for the public

120
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:06,326
is that we create living wage jobs,
or make healthy products,

121
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,577
or help, not harm, the environment.

122
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:13,850
At Just Capital, we don't know,
and it's not for us to decide.

123
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,846
We're but messengers,

124
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:19,956
but we have 100 percent confidence
and faith in the American public

125
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,190
to get it right.

126
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,410
So we'll release the findings
this September for the first time,

127
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,850
and then next year, we'll poll again,

128
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,149
and we'll take the additive step this time

129
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,168
of ranking the 1,000
largest U.S. companies

130
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:37,720
from number one to number 1,000
and everything in between.

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,551
We're calling it the Just Index,

132
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:45,800
and remember, we're an independent
not-for-profit with no bias,

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,953
and we will be giving
the American public a voice.

134
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:55,156
And maybe over time, we'll find out
that as people come to know

135
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,176
which companies are the most just,

136
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:01,216
human and economic resources
will be driven towards them,

137
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,190
and they'll become the most prosperous

138
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,021
and help our country
be the most prosperous.

139
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:11,457
Now, capitalism has been responsible
for every major innovation

140
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,608
that's made this world a more inspiring
and wonderful place to live in.

141
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:19,443
Capitalism has to be based on justice.

142
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,649
It has to be, and now more than ever,

143
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,480
with economic divisions
growing wider every day.

144
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,498
It's estimated that 47 percent
of American workers

145
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,796
can be displaced in the next 20 years.

146
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,769
I'm not against progress.

147
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,650
I want the driverless car and the jet pack
just like everyone else.

148
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,500
But I'm pleading for recognition
that with increased wealth and profits

149
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,930
has to come greater
corporate social responsibility.

150
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,665
"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith,
the father of capitalism,

151
00:08:55,665 --> 00:09:01,419
"the great, the immense fabric
of human society must in a moment

152
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,626
crumble into atoms."

153
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:09,390
Now, when I was young,
and there was a problem,

154
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,573
my mama used to always
sigh and shake her head and say,

155
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:17,630
"Have mercy, have mercy."

156
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,181
Now's not the time for us,
for the rest of us to show them mercy.

157
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:25,370
The time is now for us
to show them fairness,

158
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,846
and we can do that, you and I,

159
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:33,100
by starting where we work,
in the businesses that we operate in.

160
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,460
And when we put justness
on par with profits,

161
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,408
we'll get the most wonderful thing
in all the world.

162
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,774
We'll take back our humanity.

163
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:46,421
Thank you.

164
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:50,246
(Applause)
