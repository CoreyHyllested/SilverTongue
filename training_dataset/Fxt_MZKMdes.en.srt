0
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,808
I am failing as a woman,

1
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:17,127
I am failing as a feminist.

2
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:20,229
I have passionate opinions
about gender equality,

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:24,290
but I worry that to freely accept
the label of "feminist,"

4
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,613
would not be fair to good feminists.

5
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,557
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

6
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,445
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.

7
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,802
Or at least, I wrote an essay,

8
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,001
and then I wrote a book
called "Bad Feminist,"

9
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,461
and then in interviews, people started
calling me The Bad Feminist.

10
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,651
(Laughter)

11
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,712
So, what started as a bit
of an inside joke with myself

12
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,417
and a willful provocation,

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:49,091
has become a thing.

14
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,456
Let me take a step back.

15
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,312
When I was younger,

16
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,249
mostly in my teens and 20s,

17
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,678
I had strange ideas about feminists

18
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:01,478
as hairy, angry, man-hating,
sex-hating women --

19
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,081
as if those are bad things.

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,834
(Laughter)

21
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:10,416
These days, I look at how
women are treated the world over,

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,726
and anger, in particular, seems
like a perfectly reasonable response.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,495
But back then,

24
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,322
I worried about the tone people used

25
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:21,322
when suggesting I might be a feminist.

26
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,880
The feminist label was an accusation,

27
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:26,293
it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.

28
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,658
I was labeled a woman
who doesn't play by the rules,

29
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,303
who expects too much,

30
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,320
who thinks far too highly of myself,

31
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:37,458
by daring to believe I'm equal --
(Coughs) -- superior to a man.

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,885
You don't want to be that rebel woman,

33
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,394
until you realize that you
very much are that woman,

34
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,915
and cannot imagine being anyone else.

35
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,364
As I got older, I began to accept

36
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:50,721
that I am, indeed, a feminist,
and a proud one.

37
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,539
I hold certain truths to be self-evident:

38
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,015
Women are equal to men.

39
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,820
We deserve equal pay for equal work.

40
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,828
We have the right to move
through the world as we choose,

41
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,819
free from harassment or violence.

42
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,787
We have the right to easy,
affordable access to birth control,

43
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,708
and reproductive services.

44
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,303
We have the right to make choices
about our bodies,

45
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:16,480
free from legislative oversight
or evangelical doctrine.

46
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,988
We have the right to respect.

47
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,885
There's more.

48
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,124
When we talk about the needs of women,

49
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:25,553
we have to consider
the other identities we inhabit.

50
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:27,034
We are not just women.

51
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,365
We are people with different bodies,

52
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,404
gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,

53
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:35,319
class backgrounds, abilities,
and so much more.

54
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,105
We need to take into account

55
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,565
these differences and how they affect us,

56
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,291
as much as we account for
what we have in common.

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,299
Without this kind of inclusion,
our feminism is nothing.

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,871
I hold these truths to be self-evident,
but let me be clear:

59
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,032
I'm a mess.

60
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,313
I am full of contradictions.

61
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,257
There are many ways in which
I'm doing feminism wrong.

62
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,392
I have another confession.

63
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,752
When I drive to work, I listen
to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.

64
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:05,283
(Laughter)

65
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:07,636
Even though the lyrics
are degrading to women --

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,455
these lyrics offend me to my core --

67
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,479
the classic Yin Yang Twins
song "Salt Shaker" --

68
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,955
it is amazing.

69
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,445
(Laughter)

70
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,397
"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.

71
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:24,181
Bitch, you gotta shake it
'til your camel starts to hurt!"

72
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,363
(Laughter)

73
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,412
Think about it.

74
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:29,324
(Laughter)

75
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:30,666
Poetry, right?

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,350
I am utterly mortified
by my music choices.

77
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,286
(Laughter)

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,594
I firmly believe in man work,

79
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,027
which is anything I don't
want to do, including --

80
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,932
(Laughter) --

81
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,110
all domestic tasks,

82
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:49,443
but also: bug killing, trash removal,
lawn care and vehicle maintenance.

83
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,881
I want no part of any of that.

84
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:52,978
(Laughter)

85
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,899
Pink is my favorite color.

86
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,951
I enjoy fashion magazines
and pretty things.

87
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,278
I watch "The Bachelor"
and romantic comedies,

88
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:03,409
and I have absurd fantasies
about fairy tales coming true.

89
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,445
Some of my transgressions
are more flagrant.

90
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,280
If a woman wants to take
her husband's name,

91
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,992
that is her choice, and it is not
my place to judge.

92
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:15,598
If a woman chooses to stay home
to raise her children,

93
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,713
I embrace that choice, too.

94
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:21,808
The problem is not that she makes herself
economically vulnerable in that choice;

95
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,002
the problem is that our society is set up

96
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,982
to make women economically vulnerable
when they choose.

97
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,632
Let's deal with that.

98
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:32,979
(Applause)

99
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,484
I reject the mainstream feminism

100
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:40,135
that has historically ignored
or deflected the needs

101
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:44,547
of women of color, working-class women,
queer women and transgender women,

102
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:47,944
in favor of supporting white, middle-
and upper-class straight women.

103
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,624
Listen, if that's good feminism --
I am a very bad feminist.

104
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:52,738
(Laughter)

105
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,214
There is also this:

106
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,960
As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.

107
00:04:56,984 --> 00:05:00,653
We have this tendency to put
visible feminists on a pedestal.

108
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,740
We expect them to pose perfectly.

109
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:04,447
When they disappoint us,

110
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,933
we gleefully knock them
from the very pedestal we put them on.

111
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,992
Like I said, I am a mess --

112
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,846
consider me knocked off that pedestal

113
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,867
before you ever try to put me up there.

114
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:14,935
(Laughter)

115
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:16,434
Too many women,

116
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,483
particularly groundbreaking women
and industry leaders,

117
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,845
are afraid to be labeled as feminists.

118
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:25,575
They're afraid to stand up and say,
"Yes, I am a feminist,"

119
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,844
for fear of what that label means,

120
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:31,736
for fear of being unable to live up to
unrealistic expectations.

121
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,341
Take, for example, Beyoncé,
or as I call her, The Goddess.

122
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,301
(Laughter)

123
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:41,757
She has emerged, in recent years,
as a visible feminist.

124
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,598
At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,

125
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:48,388
she performed in front of the word
"feminist" 10 feet high.

126
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,643
It was a glorious spectacle to see

127
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:53,643
this pop star openly embracing feminism

128
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,372
and letting young women and men know

129
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,499
that being a feminist
is something to celebrate.

130
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:02,644
As the moment faded, cultural critics
began endlessly debating

131
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,328
whether or not Beyoncé was,
indeed, a feminist.

132
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,574
They graded her feminism,

133
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,866
instead of simply taking a grown,
accomplished woman at her word.

134
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,528
(Laughter)

135
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:17,226
(Applause)

136
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,767
We demand perfection from feminists,

137
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,148
because we are still fighting for so much,

138
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,469
we want so much,

139
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:25,026
we need so damn much.

140
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:28,575
We go far beyond reasonable,
constructive criticism,

141
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,348
to dissecting any given woman's feminism,

142
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:33,753
tearing it apart
until there's nothing left.

143
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,642
We do not need to do that.

144
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:40,559
Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive
feminism -- is a starting point.

145
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,036
But what happens next?

146
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:46,074
We go from acknowledging
our imperfections to accountability,

147
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,200
or walking the walk,
and being a little bit brave.

148
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,192
If I listen to degrading music,

149
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:55,742
I am creating a demand for which
artists are more than happy

150
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,676
to contribute a limitless supply.

151
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
These artists are not going to change

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,955
how they talk about women in their songs

153
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,616
until we demand that change
by affecting their bottom line.

154
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:08,125
Certainly, it is difficult.

155
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,124
Why must it be so catchy?

156
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:13,317
(Laughter)

157
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,320
It's hard to make the better choice,

158
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:19,140
and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.

159
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,202
But --

160
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,981
when I justify bad choices,

161
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:24,924
I make it harder for women
to achieve equality,

162
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,812
the equality that we all deserve,

163
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,153
and I need to own that.

164
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,802
I think of my nieces, ages three and four.

165
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,265
They are gorgeous
and headstrong, brilliant girls,

166
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,863
who are a whole lot of brave.

167
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:39,201
I want them to thrive in a world
where they are valued

168
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,553
for the powerful creatures they are.

169
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,632
I think of them,

170
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:46,315
and suddenly, the better choice
becomes far easier to make.

171
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,865
We can all make better choices.

172
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,830
We can change the channel
when a television show

173
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,524
treats sexual violence
against women like sport,

174
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,976
Game of Thrones.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,810
We can change the radio station

176
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:01,039
when we hear songs
that treat women as nothing.

177
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,746
We can spend our
box office dollars elsewhere

178
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,320
when movies don't treat women

179
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,743
as anything more than decorative objects.

180
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,984
We can stop supporting professional sports

181
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:13,258
where the athletes treat
their partners like punching bags.

182
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:17,649
(Applause)

183
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,542
In other ways, men --
and especially straight white men --

184
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,653
can say, "No, I will not publish
with your magazine,

185
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,963
or participate in your project,
or otherwise work with you,

186
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:31,384
until you include a fair number of women,

187
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,955
both as participants and decision makers.

188
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,797
I won't work with you
until your publication,

189
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:40,582
or your organization, is more inclusive
of all kinds of difference."

190
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,518
Those of us who are underrepresented

191
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,711
and invited to participate
in such projects,

192
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,104
can also decline to be included

193
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,131
until more of us are invited
through the glass ceiling,

194
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,107
and we are tokens no more.

195
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,227
Without these efforts,

196
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,053
without taking these stands,

197
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:59,659
our accomplishments
are going to mean very little.

198
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,978
We can commit these small acts of bravery

199
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,905
and hope that our choices trickle
upward to the people in power --

200
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,540
editors, movie and music producers,

201
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:11,937
CEOs, lawmakers --

202
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,174
the people who can make
bigger, braver choices

203
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:16,979
to create lasting, meaningful change.

204
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:20,201
We can also boldly claim our feminism --

205
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,590
good, bad, or anywhere in between.

206
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,781
The last line of my book
"Bad Feminist" says,

207
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:29,724
"I would rather be a bad feminist
than no feminist at all."

208
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
This is true for so many reasons,

209
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:35,864
but first and foremost, I say this
because once upon a time,

210
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,717
my voice was stolen from me,

211
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,666
and feminism helped me
to get my voice back.

212
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,605
There was an incident.

213
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,335
I call it an incident so I can carry
the burden of what happened.

214
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,136
Some boys broke me,

215
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,950
when I was so young, I did not know

216
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,400
what boys can do to break a girl.

217
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,542
They treated me like I was nothing.

218
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,040
I began to believe I was nothing.

219
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,103
They stole my voice, and in the after,

220
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,484
I did not dare to believe

221
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:02,924
that anything I might say could matter.

222
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:03,957
But --

223
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,353
I had writing.

224
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,813
And there, I wrote myself back together.

225
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:11,256
I wrote myself toward a stronger
version of myself.

226
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,004
I read the words of women

227
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,360
who might understand a story like mine,

228
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,155
and women who looked like me,

229
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:21,279
and understood what it was like to move
through the world with brown skin.

230
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:25,578
I read the words of women
who showed me I was not nothing.

231
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,284
I learned to write like them,

232
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,490
and then I learned to write as myself.

233
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,000
I found my voice again,

234
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:35,080
and I started to believe that my voice
is powerful beyond measure.

235
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:37,586
Through writing and feminism,

236
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,364
I also found that if I was
a little bit brave,

237
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,989
another woman might hear me
and see me and recognize

238
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:47,604
that none of us are the nothing
the world tries to tell us we are.

239
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,668
In one hand,

240
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,716
I hold the power to accomplish anything.

241
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,741
And in my other,

242
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,449
I hold the humbling reality
that I am just one woman.

243
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,597
I am a bad feminist,

244
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,263
I am a good woman,

245
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,662
I am trying to become better
in how I think,

246
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,946
and what I say, and what I do,

247
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,755
without abandoning everything
that makes me human.

248
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:11,676
I hope that we can all do the same.

249
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,943
I hope that we can all be
a little bit brave,

250
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,054
when we most need such bravery.

251
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,537
(Applause)
