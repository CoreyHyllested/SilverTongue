0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,666
(Mosquito buzzing)

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,240
(Swat)

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,630
Gotcha.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,160
Mosquitoes.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,080
I hate them.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,320
Don't you?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,576
That awful buzzing sound at night
around your ears

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
that drives you absolutely crazy?

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,776
Knowing that she wants
to stick a needle in your skin

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
and suck out your blood?

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,720
That's awful, right?

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
In fact, there's only one good thing
I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
When they fly into our bedroom at night,

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,134
they prefer to bite my wife.

15
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,816
(Laughter)

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,296
But that's fascinating, right?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
Why does she receive more bites than I do?

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,016
And the answer is smell,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
the smell of her body.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,976
And since we all smell different
and produce chemicals on our skin

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,936
that either attract or repel mosquitoes,

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,640
some of us are just
more attractive than others.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,600
So my wife smells nicer than I do,
or I just stink more than she does.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,776
Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark
by sniffing us out. They smell us.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,096
And during my PhD,
I wanted to know exactly

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,200
what chemicals from our skin
African malaria mosquitoes use

27
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:38,464
to track us down at night.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
And there's a whole range
of compounds that they do use.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,800
And this was not going to be an easy task.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,640
And therefore we set up
various experiments.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,816
Why did we set up these experiments?

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,136
Because half the world's population

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,456
runs the risk of contracting
a killer disease like malaria

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
through a simple mosquito bite.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,256
Every 30 seconds,
somewhere on this planet,

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,736
a child dies of malaria,

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,656
and Paul Levy this morning,
he was talking about the metaphor

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,176
of the 727 crashing
into the United States.

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,856
Well, in Africa, we have
the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,160
crashing every day.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,615
But perhaps if we can attract
these mosquitoes to traps,

42
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,216
bait it with our smell,

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,160
we may be able
to stop transmission of disease.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,576
Now, solving this puzzle
was not an easy thing,

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,576
because we produce hundreds
of different chemicals on the skin,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,256
but we undertook
some remarkable experiments

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,576
that managed us to resolve
this puzzle very quickly indeed.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,936
First, we observed
that not all mosquito species

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
bite on the same part of the body.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,816
Strange.

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,416
So we set up an experiment

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,797
where we put a naked volunteer
in a large cage,

53
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,836
(Laughter)

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,296
and in that cage, we released mosquitoes

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,000
to see where they were biting
on the body of that person.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
And we found some remarkable differences.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,016
On the left here you see the bites

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,296
by the Dutch malaria mosquito
on this person.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,000
They had a very strong preference
for biting on the face.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,336
In contrast, the African malaria mosquito

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,536
had a very strong preference for biting
the ankles and feet of this person.

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,016
And that, of course,
we should have known all along,

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,176
because they're called
mosqui-toes, you see?

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,536
(Laughter)

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,776
That's right.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,056
(Applause)

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,440
And so we started
focusing on the smell of feet ...

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,056
on the smell of human feet,

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,816
until we came across
a remarkable statement in the literature

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,616
that said that cheese smells after feet

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,240
rather than the reverse.

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,296
Think of it.

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,749
And this triggered us
to do a remarkable experiment.

74
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:53,816
We tried, with a tiny little piece
of Limburger cheese,

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,600
which smells badly after feet,

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,376
to attract African malaria mosquitoes.

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
And you know what? It worked.

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,416
In fact, it worked so well

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,976
that now we have a synthetic mixture
of the aroma of Limburger cheese

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,776
that we're using in Tanzania

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,016
and has been shown there

82
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,000
to be two to three times
more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.

83
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,256
Limburg, be proud of your cheese,

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,416
as it is now used
in the fight against malaria.

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,698
(Applause)

86
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,399
That's the cheese, just to show you.

87
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,880
My second story is remarkable as well.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,080
It's about man's best friend.
It's about dogs.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,320
And I will show you how we can use dogs
in the fight against malaria.

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,736
One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,056
is not to wait until
they fly around like adults

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,960
and bite people and transmit disease.

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,200
It's to kill them when they're still
in the water as larvae.

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,136
Why?

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Because they are just like the CIA.

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,456
In that pool of water,
these larvae are concentrated.

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,136
They're all together there.
They are immobile.

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,816
They can't escape from that water.

99
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,416
They can't fly.

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,136
And they're accessible.

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,200
You can actually walk up to that pool
and you can kill them there, right?

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,736
So the problem that we face with this

103
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,656
is that, throughout the landscape,
all these pools of water with the larvae,

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,656
they are scattered all over the place,

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,896
which makes it very hard
for an inspector like this

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,480
to actually find all these breeding sites
and treat them with insecticides.

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,240
And last year we thought very, very hard,
how can we resolve this problem?

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,416
Until we realized that just like us --
we have a unique smell --

109
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,720
mosquito larvae
also have a very unique smell.

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,656
And so we set up another crazy experiment,

111
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,016
because we collected
the smell of these larvae,

112
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,320
put it on pieces of cloth,
and then did something very remarkable.

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,376
Here we have a bar with four holes

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,176
and we put the smell
of these larvae in the left hole.

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,416
Oh, that was very quick.

116
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,576
And then you see the dog.
It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,216
He's examining these holes
and now he's got it already.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,576
He's going back to check
the control holes again,

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,456
but he's coming back to the first one,

120
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,296
and now he's locking into that smell,

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,936
which means that now,
we can use dogs with these inspectors

122
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,176
to much better find the breeding sites
of mosquitoes in the field,

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,600
and therefore have
a much bigger impact on malaria.

124
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,936
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.

125
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,199
She's one of the best
dog trainers in the world,

126
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,263
and she believes
that we can do a lot more.

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,616
Since we also know that people
that carry malaria parasites

128
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,496
smell different compared to people
that are uninfected,

129
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,920
she's convinced that we can train dogs
to find people that carry the parasite.

130
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,216
That means that in a population
where malaria has gone down all the way

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,656
and there's few people
remaining with parasites,

132
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,416
that the dogs can find these people,

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,336
we can treat them with antimalarial drugs
and give the final blow to malaria.

134
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,640
Man's best friend
in the fight against malaria.

135
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,446
My third story is perhaps
even more remarkable ...

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,756
and, I should say, has never been shown
to the public until today.

137
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,781
(Audience cheers)

138
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,005
Yeah.

139
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,736
It's a crazy story, but I believe
it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge

140
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
against mosquitoes ever.

141
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,936
In fact, people have told me

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,440
that now they will enjoy
being bitten by mosquitoes.

143
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,056
And the question of course is,

144
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,240
what would make someone
enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,120
And the answer I have right here ...

146
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,522
in my pocket --

147
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,547
(Laughter)

148
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,771
if I get it.

149
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,160
It's a tablet.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,216
A simple tablet,

151
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,600
and when I take it with water ...

152
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
it does miracles.

153
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Thank you.

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Now, let me show you how this works.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,680
Here in this box, I have a cage

156
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:10,992
with several hundred
hungry female mosquitoes ...

157
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:12,296
(Laughter)

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,776
that I'm just about to release.

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,576
(Laughter)

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,941
Just kidding, just kidding.

161
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,336
(Laughter)

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,416
What I'm going to show you
is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it

163
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
and I will show you
how quickly they will bite.

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,680
There we go.

165
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,671
Don't worry, I do this
all the time in the lab.

166
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,520
There we go.

167
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,760
OK.

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Now, on the video --

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,136
on the video here,

170
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,296
I'm going to show you
exactly the same thing,

171
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,456
except that what
I'm showing you on the video

172
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,280
happened one hour after I took the tablet.

173
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,000
Have a look.

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,936
That doesn't work.

175
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,159
OK. Sorry about that.

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,576
I'm sticking in my arm,
I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,

177
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,096
I'm shaking them off,
and we follow them through time

178
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,616
to see these mosquitoes
get very, very sick indeed,

179
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,160
here shown in fast motion.

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,856
And three hours later,
what we see at the bottom of the cage

181
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
is dead mosquitoes ...

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
very dead mosquitoes.

183
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,816
And I'm going to say,
ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.

185
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,416
They don't kill us. We kill them.

186
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,440
(Applause)

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
Now --

188
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,136
(Laughter)

189
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,680
Maastricht, be prepared.

190
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,296
Now, think of what we can do with this.

191
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,456
We can actually use this
to contain outbreaks

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,560
of mosquito-born diseases,
of epidemics, right?

193
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,176
And better still,
imagine what would happen

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
if, in a very large area, everyone would
take these drugs, for just three weeks.

195
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,536
That would give us an opportunity

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,680
to actually eliminate
malaria as a disease.

197
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,296
So cheese, dogs and a pill
to kill mosquitoes.

198
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,280
That's the kind of out-of-the-box
science that I love doing ...

199
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,136
for the betterment of mankind,

200
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,776
but especially for her,

201
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,696
so that she can grow up
in a world without malaria.

202
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,936
Thank you.

203
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,341
(Applause)
