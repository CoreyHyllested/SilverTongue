0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,816
It has been 128 years

1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,400
since the last country
in the world abolished slavery

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,656
and 53 years

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,760
since Martin Luther King pronounced
his "I Have A Dream" speech.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,976
But we still live in a world

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,200
where the color of our skin
not only gives a first impression,

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,760
but a lasting one that remains.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,376
I was born in a family full of colors.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,416
My father is the son of a maid

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,520
from whom he inherited
an intense dark chocolate tone.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,976
He was adopted by those
who I know as my grandparents.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,256
The matriarch, my grandma,

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,296
My grandpa was somewhere between
a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,960
like my uncle and my cousin.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,536
My mother is a cinnamon-skin
daughter of a native Brazilian,

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,240
with a pinch of hazel and honey,

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,856
and a man [who is]
a mix of coffee with milk,

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
but with a lot of coffee.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,656
She has two sisters.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,576
One in a toasted-peanut skin

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,016
and the other,

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,576
also adopted,

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,496
more on the beige side,

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,816
like a pancake.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,216
(Laughter)

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,096
Growing up in this family,

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,720
color was never important for me.

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,040
Outside home, however,
things were different soon.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,880
Color had many other meanings.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,936
I remember my first
drawing lessons in school

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,896
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,856
It was exciting and creative

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
but I never understood
the unique flesh-colored pencil.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,735
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

35
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,536
My skin was brown,
and people said I was black.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,720
I was seven years old
with a mess of colors in my head.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
Later,

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,376
when I took my cousin to school,

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
I was usually taken for the nanny.

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,976
By helping in the kitchen
at a friend's party,

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
people thought I was the maid.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,696
I was even treated like a prostitute

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,240
just because I was walking alone
on the beach with European friends.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,256
And many times,

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,856
visiting my grandma or friends
in upper class buildings,

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,816
I was invited not to use
the main elevator.

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,216
Because in the end,

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,936
with this color and this hair,

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,880
I cannot belong to some places.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,616
In some way,

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,176
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,000
However, something inside of me
keeps revolving and struggling.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,880
Years later I married a Spaniard.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,616
But not any Spaniard.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,536
I chose one with the skin color
of a lobster when sunburnt.

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,576
(Laughter)

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,936
Since then, a new question
started to chase me.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,320
What will be the color of your children?

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
As you can understand,
this is my last concern.

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,976
But thinking about it,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,936
with my previous background,

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,056
my story led me to make
my personal exercise as a photographer.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,920
And that is how Humanae was born.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,576
Humanae is a pursuit
to highlight our true colors,

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,256
rather than the untrue

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,696
white, red, black or yellow
associated with race.

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,056
It's a kind of game to question our codes.

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,136
It's a work in progress
from a personal story to a global history.

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
I portray the subjects
in a white background.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,776
Then I choose an 11-pixel
square from the nose,

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,440
paint the background,

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,320
and look for the corresponding color
in the industrial palette, Pantone.

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,456
I started with my family and friends,

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,376
then more and more people
joined the adventure,

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,160
thanks to public calls
coming through the social media.

76
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,016
I thought that the main space
to show my work was the Internet

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,576
because I want an open concept
that invites everybody

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,880
to push the share button
in both the computer and their brain.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,120
The snowball started to roll.

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,000
The project had a great welcome --

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,216
invitations, exhibitions,

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,976
physical formats,

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
galleries and museums ...

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,536
just happened.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,120
And among them, my favorite:

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,320
when Humanae occupies public spaces

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,480
and appears in the street,

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,040
it fosters a popular debate

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
and creates a feeling of community.

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,896
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,536
in 13 different countries,

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,616
19 different cities around the world.

93
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,176
Just to mention some of them --

94
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,736
from someone included in the Forbes list,

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,216
to refugees who crossed
the Mediterranean by boat.

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,656
In Paris, from the UNESCO
Headquarters to a shelter.

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,600
And students both in Switzerland
and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

98
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,336
All kinds of beliefs,

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,896
gender identities

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,520
or physical impairments,

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,136
a newborn or terminally ill.

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,000
We all together build Humanae.

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,640
Those portraits make us rethink
how we see each other.

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,976
When modern science
is questioning the race concept,

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,880
what does it mean for us
to be black, white, yellow, red?

106
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,080
Is it the eye, the nose,
the mouth, the hair?

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,056
Or does it have to do with our origin,

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,336
nationality

109
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
or bank account?

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,240
This personal exercise
turned out to be a discovery.

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,856
Suddenly I realized that Humanae
was useful for many people.

112
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,136
It represents a sort of mirror

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
for those who cannot find
themselves reflected in any label.

114
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,616
It was amazing

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,000
that people started to share
their thoughts about the work with me.

116
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,056
I have hundreds of that,

117
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
I will share with you, too.

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
A mother of 11 years --

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,400
A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,856
"Very good for me as a tool
to work on her confidence,

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,936
as this past weekend

122
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,896
one of her girlfriends argued with her
that she does not belong

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,160
and should not be allowed
to live in Norway.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,936
So your work has
a very special place in my heart

125
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,760
and it's very important for me."

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,560
A woman shared her portrait
on Facebook and wrote,

127
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,856
"All my life,

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,976
people from across the globe
had difficulties to place me in a group,

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,456
a stereotype,

130
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,776
a box.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,976
Perhaps we should stop.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,136
Instead of framing, ask the individual,

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,456
'How would you label yourself?'

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,296
Then I would say,

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,336
'Hi. I'm Massiel.

136
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,896
I'm a Dominican-Dutch,

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,936
I grew up in a mixed family

138
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,840
and I'm a bisexual woman.' "

139
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,976
Besides these unexpected
and touching reactions,

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,656
Humanae finds a new life
in a different variety of fields.

141
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,840
Just to show you some examples,

142
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,895
illustrators and art students

143
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,015
using it as a reference
for their sketches and their studies.

144
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,080
It's a collection of faces.

145
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,776
Researchers in the fields of anthropology,

146
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,096
physics and neuroscience

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,256
use Humanae with different
scientific approaches

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,896
related to human ethnicity,

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,656
optophysiology,

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,416
face recognition

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
or Alzheimer's.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,416
One of the most important
impacts of the project

153
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,096
is that Humanae was chosen
to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,

154
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,200
one of the most relevant
political publications.

155
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,256
And talking about foreign affairs,

156
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,000
I found the perfect
ambassadors for my project ...

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,896
teachers.

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,880
They are the ones that use Humanae
as a tool for educational purposes.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,336
Their passion encourages me
to go back to drawing classes,

160
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,200
but this time as a teacher myself.

161
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,656
My students,

162
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,936
both adults and kids,

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,736
paint their self-portraits,

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,240
trying to discover
their own unique color.

165
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,736
As a photographer,

166
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,360
I realize that I can be a channel
for others to communicate.

167
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,856
As an individual,

168
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
as Angélica,

169
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,256
every time I take a picture,

170
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,480
I feel that I am sitting
in front of a therapist.

171
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,416
All the frustration, fear and loneliness

172
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,880
that I once felt ...

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,600
becomes love.

174
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,800
The last country --

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,016
the last country in the world
who abolished slavery

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
is the country where I was born,

177
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Brazil.

178
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,200
We still have to work hard
to abolish discrimination.

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,056
That remains a common practice worldwide,

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,680
