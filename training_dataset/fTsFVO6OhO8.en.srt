0
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:17,701
These dragons from deep time
are incredible creatures.

1
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,146
They're bizzarre,

2
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,856
they're beautiful,

3
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,841
and there's very little
we know about them.

4
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,131
These thoughts were going
through my head

5
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:30,574
when I looked at the pages of
my first dinosaur book.

6
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:33,078
I was about five years old at the time,

7
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:35,031
and I decided there and then

8
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,876
that I would become a paleontologist.

9
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:41,213
Paleontology allowed me
to combine my love for animals

10
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:45,941
with my desire to travel to
far-flung corners of the world.

11
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,964
And now, a few years later,
I've led several expeditions

12
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:54,146
to the ultimate far-flung corner
on this planet, the Sahara.

13
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:58,195
I've worked in the Sahara because
I've been on a quest

14
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:03,300
to uncover new remains of
a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,451
called Spinosaurus.

16
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,804
A few bones of this animal
have been found

17
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,184
in the deserts of Egypt

18
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:16,537
and were described about 100 years ago
by a German paleontologist.

19
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:21,485
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones
were destroyed in World War II.

20
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:25,789
So all we're left with are just
a few drawings and notes.

21
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,050
From these drawings,

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,461
we know that this creature, which lived
about 100 million years ago,

23
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,012
was very big,

24
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,425
it had tall spines on its back,
forming a magnificent sail,

25
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:40,172
and it had long, slender jaws,
a bit like a crocodile,

26
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,760
with conical teeth,

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,647
that may have been used
to catch slippery prey, like fish.

28
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,704
But that was pretty much
all we knew

29
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:54,303
about this animal for the next 100 years.

30
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:03,365
My fieldwork took me to the border region
between Morocco and Algeria,

31
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:05,938
a place called the Kem Kem.

32
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,251
It's a difficult place to work in.

33
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,940
You have to deal with sandstorms
and snakes and scorpions,

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,084
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.

35
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,900
But our hard work paid off.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,115
We discovered many incredible specimens.

37
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:21,867
There's the largest dinosaur bone

38
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,375
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.

39
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:28,969
We found remains of giant
predatory dinosaurs,

40
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,632
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,

41
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:37,231
and seven or eight different kinds
of crocodile-like hunters.

42
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,233
These fossils were deposited
in a river system.

43
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:44,403
The river system was also home
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,

44
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:47,863
a monster sawfish,

45
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:51,563
and the skies over the river system
were filled with pterosaurs,

46
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:53,591
flying reptiles.

47
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,210
It was a pretty dangerous place,

48
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,929
not the kind of place where you'd want
to travel to if you had a time machine.

49
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,079
So we're finding all these
incredible fossils of animals

50
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,769
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,

51
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,538
but Spinosaurus itself proved
to be very elusive.

52
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,285
We were just finding bits and pieces

53
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:14,700
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,357
Finally, very recently,

55
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:20,467
we were able to track down a dig site

56
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:25,431
where a local fossil hunter found
several bones of Spinosaurus.

57
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:28,291
We returned to the site,
we collected more bones.

58
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,364
And so after 100 years we finally
had another partial skeleton

59
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,525
of this bizarre creature.

60
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,196
And we were able to reconstruct it.

61
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,090
We now know that
Spinosaurus had a head

62
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,886
a little bit like a crocodile,

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,081
very different from other
predatory dinosaurs,

64
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,818
very different from the T. rex.

65
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,671
But the really interesting information
came from the rest of the skeleton.

66
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,004
We had long spines,

67
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,632
the spines forming the big sail.

68
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,877
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,

69
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:59,325
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --

70
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,140
again, very unusual, no other
dinosaur has feet like this --

71
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,251
and we think they may have been
used to walk on soft sediment,

72
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:07,943
or maybe for paddling in the water.

73
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:11,381
We also looked at the fine
microstructure of the bone,

74
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,377
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,

75
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,136
and it turns out that they're
very dense and compact.

76
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:19,994
Again, this is something we see in animals
that spend a lot of time in the water,

77
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,186
it's useful for buoyancy
control in the water.

78
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:28,559
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.

79
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,770
And when we looked
at the digital skeleton,

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,206
we realized that yes, this was
a dinosaur unlike any other.

81
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,805
It's bigger than a T. rex,

82
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:39,530
and yes, the head has "fish-eating"
written all over it,

83
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,629
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --

84
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,464
dense bone, paddle-like feet,
and the hind limbs are reduced in size,

85
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,672
and again, this is something
we see in animals

86
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:53,551
that spend a substantial amount
of time in the water.

87
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,104
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --

88
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:02,268
I'm looking at muscle attachments
and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --

89
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,148
we realize that we're dealing
with a river monster,

90
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,477
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,

91
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:11,253
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,

92
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,503
feeding on the many aquatic animals
I showed you earlier on.

93
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:17,369
So that's really what makes this
an incredible discovery.

94
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,874
It's a dinosaur like no other.

95
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,441
And some people told me, "Wow,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

96
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:25,703
There are not many things left
to discover in the world."

97
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:29,975
Well, I think nothing could be
further from the truth.

98
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,246
I think the Sahara's
still full of treasures,

99
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:35,431
and when people tell me there are
no places left to explore,

100
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:39,468
I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,
Roy Chapman Andrews,

101
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:45,084
and he said, "Always, there has been
an adventure just around the corner --

102
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:47,896
and the world is still full of corners."

103
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,815
That was true many decades ago

104
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,857
when Roy Chapman Andrews
wrote these lines.

105
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:53,839
And it is still true today.

106
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,727
Thank you.

107
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,421
(Applause)
