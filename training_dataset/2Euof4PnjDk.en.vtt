00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.640
Interpreter: Piano, "p,"
is my favorite musical symbol.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.170
It means to play softly.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.349
If you're playing a musical instrument
and you notice a "p" in the score,

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.279
you need to play softer.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.080
Two p's -- even softer.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.570
Four p's -- extremely soft.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.910
This is my drawing of a p-tree,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.149
which demonstrates

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.460
no matter how many thousands
upon thousands of p's there may be,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.739
you'll never reach complete silence.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.100
That's my current definition of silence:

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.129
a very obscure sound.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.030
I'd like to share a little bit

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.809
about the history
of American Sign Language, ASL,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.970
plus a bit of my own background.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.260
French sign language was brought
to America during the early 1800s,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.330
and as time went by,
mixed with local signs,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.290
it evolved into the language
we know today as ASL.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.890
So it has a history of about 200 years.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.460
I was born deaf,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.930
and I was taught to believe
that sound wasn't a part of my life.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.030
And I believed it to be true.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.780
Yet, I realize now
that that wasn't the case at all.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.470
Sound was very much a part of my life,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.720
really, on my mind every day.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.910
As a Deaf person living
in a world of sound,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.560
it's as if I was living
in a foreign country,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.750
blindly following its rules,
customs, behaviors and norms

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:13.590
without ever questioning them.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.700
So how is it that I understand sound?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.840
Well, I watch how people
behave and respond to sound.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.380
You people are like my loudspeakers,
and amplify sound.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.500
I learn and mirror that behavior.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.900
At the same time,
I've learned that I create sound,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.240
and I've seen how people respond to me.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.090
Thus I've learned, for example ...

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.320
"Don't slam the door!"

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.650
(Laughter)

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.320
"Don't burp,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.040
and when you're eating,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.230
make sure you don't scrape
your utensils on the plate."

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.380
All of these things
I term "sound etiquette."

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.040
more than the average hearing person does.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.740
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.400
And I'm always waiting
in eager nervous anticipation

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.450
around sound, about what's to come next.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300
Hence, this drawing.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.760
TBD, to be decided.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.660
TBC, to be continued.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.240
TBA, to be announced.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.700
And you notice the staff --

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.150
there are no notes contained in the lines.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.480
That's because the lines
already contain sound

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.610
through the subtle smudges and smears.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.850
In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.080
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.970
A typical staff contains five lines.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.550
Yet for me, signing it
with my thumb sticking up like that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.200
doesn't feel natural.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.690
That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
I stick to four lines on paper.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.310
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
to travel to Berlin, Germany,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.140
for an artist residency there.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.320
Prior to this time,
I had been working as a painter.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.370
During this summer, I visited
different museums and gallery spaces,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.220
and as I went from one place to the next,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.820
I noticed there was no visual art there.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.940
At that time, sound was trending,
and this struck me ...

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.160
there was no visual art,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.680
everything was auditory.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.350
Now sound has come into my art territory.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.669
Is it going to further
distance me from art?

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.470
I realized that doesn't
have to be the case at all.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.790
I actually know sound.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.530
I know it so well

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.910
that it doesn't have to be something
just experienced through the ears.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.800
It could be felt tactually,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.350
or experienced as a visual,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.180
or even as an idea.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.370
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.210
and to put it into my art practice.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.669
And everything that I had been
taught regarding sound,

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.180
I decided to do away with and unlearn.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.970
I started creating a new body of work.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.560
And when I presented this
to the art community,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.590
I was blown away with the amount
of support and attention I received.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.490
I realized:

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.460
sound is like money,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.639
power, control --

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.440
social currency.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.510
In the back of my mind, I've always felt
that sound was your thing,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.220
a hearing person's thing.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.570
And sound is so powerful

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.360
that it could either
disempower me and my artwork,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.229
or it could empower me.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.550
I chose to be empowered.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.470
There's a massive culture
around spoken language.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.100
And just because I don't use
my literal voice to communicate,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.050
in society's eyes
it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.919
So I need to work with individuals
who can support me as an equal

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.760
and become my voice.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.880
And that way, I'm able to maintain
relevancy in society today.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.160
So at school, at work and institutions,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.500
I work with many
different ASL interpreters.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.500
And their voice becomes
my voice and identity.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.720
They help me to be heard.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.350
And their voices hold value and currency.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.509
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.620
I'm able to maintain
a temporary form of currency,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:18.240
kind of like taking out a loan
with a very high interest rate.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.130
If I didn't continue this practice,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.080
I feel that I could just
fade off into oblivion

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.660
and not maintain
any form of social currency.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.220
So with sound as my new art medium,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.440
I delved into the world of music.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.330
And I was surprised to see
the similarities between music and ASL.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.770
For example,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.290
a musical note

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.960
cannot be fully captured
and expressed on paper.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.770
And the same holds true
for a concept in ASL.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.320
They're both highly spatial
and highly inflected --

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.419
meaning that subtle changes

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.360
can affect the entire meaning

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.080
of both signs and sounds.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.270
I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.070
to have you have a better
understanding of how ASL works.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.979
So, envision a piano.

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:23.900
ASL is broken down into
many different grammatical parameters.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.880
If you assign a different parameter
to each finger as you play the piano --

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.009
such as facial expression, body movement,

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:37.860
speed, hand shape and so on,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.939
as you play the piano --

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:41.939
English is a linear language,

00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:44.860
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.309
However, ASL is more like a chord --

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:51.730
all 10 fingers need
to come down simultaneously

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:57.740
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.079
If just one of those keys
were to change the chord,

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:04.269
it would create a completely
different meaning.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:12.679
The same applies to music
in regards to pitch, tone and volume.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:16.269
In ASL, by playing around with these
different grammatical parameters,

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.929
you can express different ideas.

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:20.420
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.550
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:28.259
I'm looking at you.

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:30.889
Staring at you.

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:32.759
(Laughter)

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.619
(Laughter)

00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:38.350
Oh -- busted.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.220
(Laughter)

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.079
Uh-oh.

00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:47.490
What are you looking at?

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.170
Aw, stop.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.509
(Laughter)

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:53.730
I then started thinking,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.709
"What if I was to look at ASL
through a musical lens?"

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:00.369
If I was to create a sign
and repeat it over and over,

00:10:00.369 --> 00:10:04.110
it could become
like a piece of visual music.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.850
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.100
as the sun rises and sets.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.569
This is "all day."

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:20.100
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.369
visually it looks like a piece of music.

00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:27.249
All ... day.

00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:32.730
I feel the same holds true
for "all night."

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.079
"All night."

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:42.759
This is ALL-NIGHT,
represented in this drawing.

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:47.470
And this led me to thinking
about three different kinds of nights:

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.809
"last night,"

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:50.980
"overnight,"

00:10:50.980 --> 00:11:00.649
(Sings) "all night long."

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:07.970
(Laughter)

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.129
I feel like the third one has
a lot more musicality than the other two.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:13.639
(Laughter)

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.670
This represents how time
is expressed in ASL

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:21.059
and how the distance from your body
can express the changes in time.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:22.119
For example,

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:25.959
1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:29.069
present tense happens closest
and in front of the body,

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:34.179
future is in front of the body
and the past is to your back.

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:40.439
So, the first example
is "a long time ago."

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:41.989
Then "past,"

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:44.949
"used to"

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:48.489
and the last one, which is my favorite,

00:11:48.489 --> 00:11:51.139
with the very romantic
and dramatic notion to it,

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:52.379
"once upon a time."

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.230
(Laughter)

00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:00.939
"Common time"

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:02.549
is a musical term

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:07.709
with a specific time signature
of four beats per measure.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:09.509
Yet when I see the word "common time,"

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:13.739
what automatically comes to mind for me
is "at the same time."

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:17.709
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.999
We have the staff
across the head and the chest.

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:22.319
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:23.470
[Common time]

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.790
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.920
I'm now going to demonstrate
a hand shape called the "flash claw."

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.679
Can you please follow along with me?

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:38.929
Everybody, hands up.

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:41.739
Now we're going to do it
in both the head and the chest,

00:12:41.739 --> 00:12:44.730
kind of like "common time"
or at the same time.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.529
Yes, got it.

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:52.819
That means "to fall in love"
in International [Sign].

00:12:52.819 --> 00:12:54.259
(Laughter)

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:56.160
International [Sign], as a note,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.679
is a visual tool to help communicate

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:02.160
across cultures and sign languages
around the world.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.129
The second one I'd like
to demonstrate is this --

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:08.309
please follow along with me again.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:17.579
And now this.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:22.179
This is "colonization" in ASL.

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:23.549
(Laughter)

00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:24.819
Now the third --

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:25.470
please follow along again.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:37.170
And again.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.639
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:42.179
So let's do all three together.

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.129
"Fall in love,"

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.199
"colonization"

00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:49.339
and "enlightenment."

00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:52.529
Good job, everyone.

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:53.600
(Laughter)

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.410
Notice how all three signs
are very similar,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.629
they all happen at the head and the chest,

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.399
but they convey quite different meanings.

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:03.179
So it's amazing to see
how ASL is alive and thriving,

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:05.470
just like music is.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.189
However, in this day and age,

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:11.829
we live in a very audio-centric world.

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:14.279
And just because ASL has no sound to it,

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:19.449
it automatically holds no social currency.

00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:23.989
We need to start thinking harder
about what defines social currency

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:27.959
and allow ASL to develop
its own form of currency --

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:30.449
without sound.

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:38.639
And this could possibly be a step
to lead to a more inclusive society.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.489
And maybe people will understand

00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:44.279
that you don't need
to be deaf to learn ASL,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:47.869
nor do you have to be hearing
to learn music.

00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:51.639
ASL is such a rich treasure

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:54.589
that I'd like you
to have the same experience.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:57.350
And I'd like to invite you
to open your ears,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.350
to open your eyes,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.819
take part in our culture

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:03.629
and experience our visual language.

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:04.999
And you never know,

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:08.189
you might just fall in love with us.

00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.790
(Applause)

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.499
Thank you.

00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:11.489
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:11.889
(Applause)
