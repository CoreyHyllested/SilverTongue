0
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:19,398
When I was a kid,

1
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,959
the disaster we worried about most
was a nuclear war.

2
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:27,085
That's why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement,

3
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,656
filled with cans of food and water.

4
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,901
When the nuclear attack came,

5
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:36,637
we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.

6
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:41,597
Today the greatest risk
of global catastrophe

7
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:44,457
doesn't look like this.

8
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,238
Instead, it looks like this.

9
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:53,929
If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades,

10
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,314
it's most likely to be
a highly infectious virus

11
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,792
rather than a war.

12
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,679
Not missiles, but microbes.

13
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,878
Now, part of the reason for this is that

14
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:10,081
we've invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents.

15
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:15,179
But we've actually invested very little
in a system to stop an epidemic.

16
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:19,093
We're not ready for the next epidemic.

17
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:21,758
Let's look at Ebola.

18
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,615
I'm sure all of you read about it
in the newspaper,

19
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,221
lots of tough challenges.

20
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,876
I followed it carefully
through the case analysis tools

21
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:35,721
we use to track polio eradication.

22
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,573
And as you look at what went on,

23
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:42,081
the problem wasn't that there was a system
that didn't work well enough,

24
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,649
the problem was that we
didn't have a system at all.

25
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:51,028
In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces.

26
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:55,940
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists
ready to go, who would have gone,

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,696
seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread.

28
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,452
The case reports came in on paper.

29
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:04,808
It was very delayed
before they were put online

30
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,782
and they were extremely inaccurate.

31
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,858
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

32
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,453
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

33
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:17,784
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières
did a great job orchestrating volunteers.

34
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,880
But even so, we were far slower
than we should have been

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,022
getting the thousands of workers
into these countries.

36
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:31,007
And a large epidemic would require us
to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

37
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,155
There was no one there
to look at treatment approaches.

38
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,946
No one to look at the diagnostics.

39
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,243
No one to figure out
what tools should be used.

40
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:45,723
As an example, we could have
taken the blood of survivors,

41
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:51,158
processed it, and put that plasma
back in people to protect them.

42
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:53,764
But that was never tried.

43
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,520
So there was a lot that was missing.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,415
And these things
are really a global failure.

45
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:05,873
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,
but not to do these things I talked about.

46
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,842
Now, in the movies it's quite different.

47
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:14,674
There's a group of handsome
epidemiologists ready to go,

48
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:20,446
they move in, they save the day,
but that's just pure Hollywood.

49
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:25,887
The failure to prepare
could allow the next epidemic

50
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:29,695
to be dramatically
more devastating than Ebola

51
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:35,531
Let's look at the progression
of Ebola over this year.

52
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,149
About 10,000 people died,

53
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:43,846
and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.

54
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,433
There's three reasons why
it didn't spread more.

55
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:50,874
The first is that there was a lot
of heroic work by the health workers.

56
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:54,136
They found the people and they
prevented more infections.

57
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:56,621
The second is the nature of the virus.

58
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,697
Ebola does not spread through the air.

59
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,810
And by the time you're contagious,

60
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,550
most people are so sick
that they're bedridden.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,411
Third, it didn't get
into many urban areas.

62
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,115
And that was just luck.

63
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:14,355
If it had gotten into a lot
more urban areas,

64
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,877
the case numbers
would have been much larger.

65
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:21,466
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

66
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:26,530
You can have a virus where people
feel well enough while they're infectious

67
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,842
that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.

68
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,846
The source of the virus could be
a natural epidemic like Ebola,

69
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:34,826
or it could be bioterrorism.

70
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:39,474
So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.

71
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:45,475
In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,

72
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:49,070
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,560
So here's what would happen:

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,558
It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.

75
00:04:55,558 --> 00:05:00,683
And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.

76
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,496
So this is a serious problem.

77
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:04,257
We should be concerned.

78
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:08,692
But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.

79
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:13,836
We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.

80
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:14,883
We've got cell phones

81
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:18,140
to get information from the public
and get information out to them.

82
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,319
We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they're moving.

83
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,627
We have advances in biology

84
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:28,453
that should dramatically change
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

85
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,322
and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.

86
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,888
So we can have tools,

87
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:39,500
but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,793
And we need preparedness.

89
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,257
The best lessons, I think,
on how to get prepared

90
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:46,758
are again, what we do for war.

91
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:51,005
For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.

92
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,316
We have reserves that can scale
us up to large numbers.

93
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:58,005
NATO has a mobile unit
that can deploy very rapidly.

94
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:01,455
NATO does a lot of war games
to check, are people well trained?

95
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,883
Do they understand
about fuel and logistics

96
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,241
and the same radio frequencies?

97
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,779
So they are absolutely ready to go.

98
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:13,134
So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.

99
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,301
What are the key pieces?

100
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:20,591
First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.

101
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,778
That's where mothers
can give birth safely,

102
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,295
kids can get all their vaccines.

103
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:29,634
But, also where we'll see
the outbreak very early on.

104
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,935
We need a medical reserve corps:

105
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,501
lots of people who've got
the training and background

106
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:37,853
who are ready to go, with the expertise.

107
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:42,266
And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.

108
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:46,417
taking advantage of the military's ability
to move fast, do logistics

109
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,220
and secure areas.

110
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,129
We need to do simulations,

111
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,927
germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.

112
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,723
The last time a germ game
was done in the United States

113
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:02,443
was back in 2001,
and it didn't go so well.

114
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:07,490
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.

115
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,609
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

116
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,246
There are some big breakthroughs,
like the Adeno-associated virus,

117
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:21,229
that could work very, very quickly.

118
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,599
Now I don't have an exact budget
for what this would cost,

119
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,095
but I'm quite sure it's very modest
compared to the potential harm.

120
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:33,740
The World Bank estimates that
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

121
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,465
global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars

122
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:41,332
and we'd have millions
and millions of deaths.

123
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:44,317
These investments
offer significant benefits

124
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,518
beyond just being ready for the epidemic.

125
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,982
The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D,

126
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:51,812
those things would reduce
global health equity

127
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:55,502
and make the world more just
as well as more safe.

128
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:58,864
So I think this should absolutely
be a priority.

129
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:00,980
There's no need to panic.

130
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,469
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti
or go down into the basement.

131
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:09,309
But we need to get going,
because time is not on our side.

132
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:15,524
In fact, if there's one positive thing
that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,

133
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:21,330
it's that it can serve as an early
warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.

134
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,978
If we start now, we can be ready
for the next epidemic.

135
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,574
Thank you.

136
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,868
(Applause)
