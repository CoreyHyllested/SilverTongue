00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,018
When we're designing new products,

1
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,032
services or businesses,

2
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,574
the only time you'll know
if they're any good,

3
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,296
if the designs are good,

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,055
is to see how they're used
in the real world, in context.

5
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,695
I'm reminded of that every time
I walk past Highbury Fields

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,159
in north London.

7
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:33,501
It's absolutely beautiful.

8
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:35,222
There's a big open green space.

9
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,814
There's Georgian buildings
around the side.

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,736
But then there's this mud trap
that cuts across the middle.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,844
People clearly don't want to walk
all the way around the edge.

12
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:47,332
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,

13
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:49,812
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.

14
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,162
Now, this shortcut
is called a desire path,

15
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,686
and it's often the path
of least resistance.

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,043
I find them fascinating,

17
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:03,532
because they're often the point
where design and user experience diverge.

18
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,017
Now at this point, I should apologize,

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,913
because you guys are going to start
seeing these everywhere.

20
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,599
But today, I'm going to pick
three I find interesting

21
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:13,734
and share what actually it reminds me

22
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:16,566
about launching new products and services.

23
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:20,800
The first is in the capital city
of Brazil -- Brasilia.

24
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:23,341
And it reminds me that sometimes,

25
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:26,493
you have to just focus
on designing for a real need

26
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,786
at low friction.

27
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,764
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.

28
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:32,930
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.

29
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:35,162
It was the golden age of flying,

30
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:38,450
so he laid it out like a plane,
as you can see there.

31
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,639
Slightly worryingly,

32
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:43,411
he put most of the important
government buildings in the cockpit.

33
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:45,882
But if you zoom in,
in the very center of Brasilia,

34
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,068
just where the point is there,

35
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,492
you see it's littered with desire paths.

36
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:53,046
They're absolutely everywhere.

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,940
Now, they thought that they
had future-proofed this design.

38
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,979
They thought in the future
we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --

39
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,551
we'd be able to drive --

40
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,532
so there was little need
for walkways or pavements.

41
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,691
But as you can see, there's a real need.

42
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:09,386
These are very dangerous desire paths.

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,447
If we just pick one, in the middle,

44
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:14,878
you can see it crosses
15 lanes of traffic.

45
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,658
It won't surprise you guys

46
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:20,222
that Brasilia has five times
the pedestrian accident rate

47
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,124
of your average US city.

48
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,455
People are resourceful.

49
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,513
They'll always find the low-friction route

50
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:29,932
to save money, save time.

51
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,476
Not all these desire paths are dangerous,

52
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,893
I was reminded flying here
when I was in Heathrow.

53
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,437
Many of us get frustrated
when we're confronted

54
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,130
with the obligatory walk
through duty-free.

55
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,175
It was amazing to me

56
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,334
how many people refused to take
the long, meandering path to the left,

57
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:50,435
and just cut through to the right,

58
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,180
cut through the desire path.

59
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,521
The question that's interesting is:

60
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,735
What do designers think
when they see our behavior here?

61
00:02:58,198 --> 00:02:59,989
Do they think we're stupid?

62
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,809
Do they think we're lazy?

63
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:04,957
Or do they accept
that this is the only truth?

64
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,739
This is their product.

65
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,667
We're effectively
co-designing their product.

66
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,466
So our job is to design
for real needs at low friction,

67
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,386
because if you don't,
the customer will, anyway.

68
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,458
The second desire path I wanted to share

69
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:23,734
is at the University of California.

70
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:24,910
And it reminds me

71
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:28,092
that sometimes the best way
to come up with a great design

72
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,800
is just to launch it.

73
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:34,738
Now, university campuses are fantastic
for spotting desire paths.

74
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:38,100
I think it's because students
are always late and they're pretty smart.

75
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:39,606
So they're dashing to lectures.

76
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,723
They'll always find the shortcut.

77
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,506
And the designers here knew that.

78
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,503
So they built the buildings

79
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,441
and then they waited a few months
for the paths to form.

80
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,354
They then paved them.

81
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,417
(Laughter)

82
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,346
Incredibly smart approach.

83
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,842
In fact, often, just launching
the straw man of a service

84
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,007
can teach you what people really want.

85
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,861
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston
knew he wanted to open a restaurant.

86
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,293
But where should it be?

87
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,236
What should the menu be?

88
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:10,150
He launched a service,

89
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,860
in this case a food truck,

90
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,259
and he changed the location each day.

91
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,827
He'd write a different menu
on the side in a whiteboard marker

92
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,763
to figure out what people wanted.

93
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,637
He now has a chain of restaurants.

94
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,692
So it can be incredibly efficient

95
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,481
to launch something
to spot the desire paths.

96
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:31,314
The third and final desire path
I wanted to share with you

97
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,961
is the UNIH.

98
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,883
It reminds me that the world's in flux,

99
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,207
and we have to respond to those changes.

100
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,837
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.

101
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:44,378
I've marked for you on the left
the Oncology Department.

102
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:49,083
The patients would usually stay
in the hotels down on the bottom right.

103
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,243
This was a patient-centered organization,

104
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,895
so they laid on cars for their patients.

105
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:59,263
But what they realized when they started
offering chemotherapy

106
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:02,064
is the patients rarely
wanted to get in cars.

107
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:05,990
They were too nauseous,
so they'd walk back to their hotels.

108
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,953
This desire path that you see
diagonally, formed.

109
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:12,133
The patients even called it
"The Chemo Trail."

110
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,999
Now, when the hospital
saw this originally,

111
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,917
they tried to lay turf
back over it, ignore it.

112
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:21,860
But after a while, they realized
it was an important need

113
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,661
they were meeting for their patients,

114
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:24,993
so they paved it.

115
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:28,866
And I think our job is often
to pave these emerging desire paths.

116
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,016
If we look back at the one
in North London again,

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,410
that desire path hasn't always been there.

118
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,372
The reason it sprung up

119
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:40,494
is people were traveling to the mighty
Arsenal Football Club stadium

120
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:41,669
on game days,

121
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,470
from the Underground station
you see on the bottom right.

122
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,104
So you see the desire path.

123
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,942
If we just wind the clock
back a few years,

124
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,163
when the stadium was being constructed,

125
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:52,746
there is no desire path.

126
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,943
So our job is to watch
for these desire paths emerging,

127
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,331
and, where appropriate, pave them,

128
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,530
as someone did here.

129
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,839
Someone installed a barrier,

130
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:09,296
people started walking across
and round the bottom as you see,

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,518
and they paved it.

132
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,122
(Laughter)

133
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,534
But I think this is a wonderful
reminder as well,

134
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,410
that, actually, the world is in flux.

135
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:17,656
It's constantly changing,

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,912
because if you look
at the top of this image,

137
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,928
there's another desire path forming.

138
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,943
So these three desire paths remind me

139
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,114
we need to design for real human needs.

140
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,062
I think empathy for what
your customers want

141
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:35,820
is probably the biggest leading indicator
of business success.

142
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:37,989
Design for real needs

143
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:40,417
and design them in low friction,

144
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:43,790
because if you don't offer them
in low friction,

145
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:46,409
someone else will, often the customer.

146
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:51,035
Secondly, often the best way
to learn what people really want

147
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,923
is to launch your service.

148
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,727
The answer is rarely inside the building.

149
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,224
Get out there and see
what people really want.

150
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,149
And finally, in part
because of technology,

151
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,986
the world is incredibly flux
at the moment.

152
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,969
It's changing constantly.

153
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,238
These desire paths are going
to spring up faster than ever.

154
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,677
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones

155
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:13,946
and pave over them.

156
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:15,723
Thank you very much.

157
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:19,712
(Applause)
