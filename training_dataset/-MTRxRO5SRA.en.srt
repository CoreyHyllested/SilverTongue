00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm here today to talk about
the two ideas that,

1
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,262
at least based on
my observations at Khan Academy,

2
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:22,164
are kind of the core,
or the key leverage points for learning.

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,204
And it's the idea of mastery

4
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,013
and the idea of mindset.

5
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:28,871
I saw this in the early days
working with my cousins.

6
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,375
A lot of them were having trouble
with math at first,

7
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,453
because they had all of these gaps
accumulated in their learning.

8
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:37,466
And because of that, at some point
they got to an algebra class

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,892
and they might have been a little bit
shaky on some of the pre-algebra,

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,361
and because of that, they thought
they didn't have the math gene.

11
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:46,048
Or they'd get to a calculus class,

12
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:48,834
and they'd be a little bit
shaky on the algebra.

13
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,428
I saw it in the early days

14
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:53,980
when I was uploading
some of those videos on YouTube,

15
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:57,281
and I realized that people
who were not my cousins were watching.

16
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,170
(Laughter)

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:03,060
And at first, those comments
were just simple thank-yous.

18
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:05,053
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

19
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:07,529
I don't know how much time
you all spend on YouTube.

20
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,640
Most of the comments are not "Thank you."

21
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,121
(Laughter)

22
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,783
They're a little edgier than that.

23
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,238
But then the comments
got a little more intense,

24
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:19,718
student after student saying
that they had grown up not liking math.

25
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:22,941
It was getting difficult as they got
into more advanced math topics.

26
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:24,493
By the time they got to algebra,

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,845
they had so many gaps in their knowledge
they couldn't engage with it.

28
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,942
They thought they didn't
have the math gene.

29
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,446
But when they were a bit older,

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,713
they took a little agency
and decided to engage.

31
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:35,589
They found resources like Khan Academy

32
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:38,763
and they were able to fill in those gaps
and master those concepts,

33
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:41,377
and that reinforced their mindset
that it wasn't fixed;

34
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,966
that they actually were capable
of learning mathematics.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,043
And in a lot of ways, this is how
you would master a lot of things in life.

36
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,366
It's the way you would
learn a martial art.

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,556
In a martial art, you would
practice the white belt skills

38
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,993
as long as necessary,

39
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,568
and only when you've mastered it

40
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,727
you would move on to become a yellow belt.

41
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,822
It's the way you learn
a musical instrument:

42
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,140
you practice the basic piece
over and over again,

43
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,752
and only when you've mastered it,

44
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,447
you go on to the more advanced one.

45
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,811
But what we point out --

46
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:13,320
this is not the way a traditional
academic model is structured,

47
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:16,679
the type of academic model
that most of us grew up in.

48
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,245
In a traditional academic model,

49
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,688
we group students together,
usually by age,

50
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:21,991
and around middle school,

51
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:23,861
by age and perceived ability,

52
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:26,443
and we shepherd them all
together at the same pace.

53
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,335
And what typically happens,

54
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,860
let's say we're in a middle school
pre-algebra class,

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,678
and the current unit is on exponents,

56
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,892
the teacher will give
a lecture on exponents,

57
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,201
then we'll go home, do some homework.

58
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,279
The next morning,
we'll review the homework,

59
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,651
then another lecture, homework,
lecture, homework.

60
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,936
That will continue for about
two or three weeks,

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,135
and then we get a test.

62
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,477
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,

63
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,918
maybe you get a 90 percent,

64
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,926
maybe you get a 95 percent.

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,697
And even though the test identified
gaps in our knowledge,

66
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,680
I didn't know 25 percent of the material.

67
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:59,676
Even the A student, what was
the five percent they didn't know?

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,513
Even though we've identified the gaps,

69
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:04,075
the whole class will then
move on to the next subject,

70
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,501
probably a more advanced subject
that's going to build on those gaps.

71
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,898
It might be logarithms
or negative exponents.

72
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,953
And that process continues,
and you immediately start to realize

73
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,152
how strange this is.

74
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,947
I didn't know 25 percent
of the more foundational thing,

75
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:20,416
and now I'm being pushed
to the more advanced thing.

76
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,152
And this will continue for months, years,
all the way until at some point,

77
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,616
I might be in an algebra class
or trigonometry class

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,897
and I hit a wall.

79
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,575
And it's not because algebra
is fundamentally difficult

80
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,591
or because the student isn't bright.

81
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,926
It's because I'm seeing an equation
and they're dealing with exponents

82
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,679
and that 30 percent
that I didn't know is showing up.

83
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:43,532
And then I start to disengage.

84
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,895
To appreciate how absurd that is,

85
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,664
imagine if we did other things
in our life that way.

86
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,578
Say, home-building.

87
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:55,275
(Laughter)

88
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,272
So we bring in the contractor and say,

89
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,844
"We were told we have
two weeks to build a foundation.

90
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,204
Do what you can."

91
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,531
(Laughter)

92
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,777
So they do what they can.

93
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,957
Maybe it rains.

94
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,950
Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.

95
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:15,284
And two weeks later,
the inspector comes, looks around,

96
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,973
says, "OK, the concrete
is still wet right over there,

97
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:19,849
that part's not quite up to code ...

98
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,196
I'll give it an 80 percent."

99
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,284
(Laughter)

100
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:26,043
You say, "Great! That's a C.
Let's build the first floor."

101
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,085
(Laughter)

102
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,263
Same thing.

103
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,126
We have two weeks, do what you can,
inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.

104
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,309
Great, that's a D-plus.

105
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,579
Second floor, third floor,

106
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,381
and all of a sudden,
while you're building the third floor,

107
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:38,841
the whole structure collapses.

108
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:42,109
And if your reaction is the reaction
you typically have in education,

109
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,474
or that a lot of folks have,

110
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,604
you might say, maybe
we had a bad contractor,

111
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:48,721
or maybe we needed better inspection
or more frequent inspection.

112
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,994
But what was really broken
was the process.

113
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:54,047
We were artificially constraining
how long we had to something,

114
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,444
pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,

115
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:59,992
and we took the trouble of inspecting
and identifying those gaps,

116
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,949
but then we built right on top of it.

117
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,910
So the idea of mastery learning
is to do the exact opposite.

118
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,402
Instead of artificially
constraining, fixing

119
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,414
when and how long you work on something,

120
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,656
pretty much ensuring
that variable outcome,

121
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,353
the A, B, C, D, F --

122
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,464
do it the other way around.

123
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:17,636
What's variable is when and how long

124
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,754
a student actually has
to work on something,

125
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,025
and what's fixed is that
they actually master the material.

126
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,096
And it's important to realize

127
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,485
that not only will this make the student
learn their exponents better,

128
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,467
but it'll reinforce
the right mindset muscles.

129
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,919
It makes them realize that if you got
20 percent wrong on something,

130
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:38,332
it doesn't mean that you have
a C branded in your DNA somehow.

131
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,790
It means that you should just
keep working on it.

132
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:43,306
You should have grit;
you should have perseverance;

133
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,471
you should take agency over your learning.

134
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:48,898
Now, a lot of skeptics might say,
well, hey, this is all great,

135
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,643
philosophically, this whole idea
of mastery-based learning

136
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,103
and its connection to mindset,

137
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,226
students taking agency
over their learning.

138
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,385
It makes a lot of sense,
but it seems impractical.

139
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,806
To actually do it, every student
would be on their own track.

140
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,454
It would have to be personalized,

141
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,660
you'd have to have private tutors
and worksheets for every student.

142
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,183
And these aren't new ideas --

143
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,033
there were experiments
in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,

144
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:13,875
where they did mastery-based learning
and saw great results,

145
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,196
but they said it wouldn't scale
because it was logistically difficult.

146
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,127
The teacher had to give different
worksheets to every student,

147
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:21,439
give on-demand assessments.

148
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,724
But now today, it's no longer impractical.

149
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,114
We have the tools to do it.

150
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,733
Students see an explanation
at their own time and pace?

151
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,352
There's on-demand video for that.

152
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,448
They need practice? They need feedback?

153
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:35,912
There's adaptive exercises
readily available for students.

154
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,905
And when that happens,
all sorts of neat things happen.

155
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,702
One, the students can actually
master the concepts,

156
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,921
but they're also building
their growth mindset,

157
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,742
they're building grit, perseverance,

158
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,789
they're taking agency over their learning.

159
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:50,370
And all sorts of beautiful things
can start to happen

160
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,030
in the actual classroom.

161
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,112
Instead of it being focused
on the lecture,

162
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,954
students can interact with each other.

163
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,136
They can get deeper mastery
over the material.

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,513
They can go into simulations,
Socratic dialogue.

165
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:03,216
To appreciate what we're talking about

166
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,287
and the tragedy of lost potential here,

167
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:10,454
I'd like to give a little bit
of a thought experiment.

168
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:16,051
If we were to go 400 years
into the past to Western Europe,

169
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:19,239
which even then, was one of the more
literate parts of the planet,

170
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:22,990
you would see that about 15 percent
of the population knew how to read.

171
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:27,194
And I suspect that if you asked someone
who did know how to read,

172
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:29,114
say a member of the clergy,

173
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:32,750
"What percentage of the population
do you think is even capable of reading?"

174
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:36,335
They might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

175
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,603
maybe 20 or 30 percent."

176
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,011
But if you fast forward to today,

177
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:44,050
we know that that prediction
would have been wildly pessimistic,

178
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:48,199
that pretty close to 100 percent
of the population is capable of reading.

179
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,774
But if I were to ask you
a similar question:

180
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:55,033
"What percentage of the population
do you think is capable

181
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,930
of truly mastering calculus,

182
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:00,967
or understanding organic chemistry,

183
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,277
or being able to contribute
to cancer research?"

184
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:07,198
A lot of you might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

185
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,244
maybe 20, 30 percent."

186
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:11,091
But what if that estimate

187
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,502
is just based on your own experience
in a non-mastery framework,

188
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,358
your own experience with yourself
or observing your peers,

189
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:20,171
where you're being pushed
at this set pace through classes,

190
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,534
accumulating all these gaps?

191
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,199
Even when you got that 95 percent,

192
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,035
what was that five percent you missed?

193
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:27,786
And it keeps accumulating --
you get to an advanced class,

194
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,682
all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,

195
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:31,709
"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;

196
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,661
not meant to be a physicist;
not meant to be a mathematician."

197
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,662
I suspect that that actually is the case,

198
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:40,512
but if you were allowed to be operating
in a mastery framework,

199
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,953
if you were allowed to really
take agency over your learning,

200
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:45,573
and when you get something wrong,

201
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:48,389
embrace it -- view that failure
as a moment of learning --

202
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:52,370
that number, the percent
that could really master calculus

203
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,154
or understand organic chemistry,

204
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,680
is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.

205
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:00,458
And this isn't even just a "nice to have."

206
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,082
I think it's a social imperative.

207
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:07,362
We're exiting what you could call
the industrial age

208
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:11,190
and we're going into
this information revolution.

209
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:13,820
And it's clear that some
things are happening.

210
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,957
In the industrial age,
society was a pyramid.

211
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:20,633
At the base of the pyramid,
you needed human labor.

212
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:24,418
In the middle of the pyramid,
you had an information processing,

213
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,040
a bureaucracy class,

214
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,738
and at the top of the pyramid,
you had your owners of capital

215
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,761
and your entrepreneurs

216
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,237
and your creative class.

217
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:35,700
But we know what's happening already,

218
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,739
as we go into this information revolution.

219
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:40,716
The bottom of that pyramid,
automation, is going to take over.

220
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,065
Even that middle tier,
information processing,

221
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:44,715
that's what computers are good at.

222
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,486
So as a society, we have a question:

223
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,628
All this new productivity is happening
because of this technology,

224
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,982
but who participates in it?

225
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:54,201
Is it just going to be that very top
of the pyramid, in which case,

226
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,566
what does everyone else do?

227
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,756
How do they operate?

228
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,200
Or do we do something
that's more aspirational?

229
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:02,691
Do we actually attempt
to invert the pyramid,

230
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,716
where you have a large creative class,

231
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,421
where almost everyone
can participate as an entrepreneur,

232
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,390
an artist, as a researcher?

233
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,780
And I don't think that this is utopian.

234
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,168
I really think that this
is all based on the idea

235
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,376
that if we let people
tap into their potential

236
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,364
by mastering concepts,

237
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:22,965
by being able to exercise agency
over their learning,

238
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,331
that they can get there.

239
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:28,672
And when you think of it
as just a citizen of the world,

240
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,959
it's pretty exciting.

241
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:32,611
I mean, think about
the type of equity we can we have,

242
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:35,839
and the rate at which civilization
could even progress.

243
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,552
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.

244
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:42,139
I think it's going to be
a pretty exciting time to be alive.

245
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,329
Thank you.

246
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:48,830
(Applause)
