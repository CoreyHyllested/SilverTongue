0
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:13,988
Is there a real you?

1
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:16,338
This might seem to you
like a very odd question.

2
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,897
Because, you might ask,

3
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:21,225
how do we find the real you,

4
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:23,259
how do you know what the real you is?

5
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,223
And so forth.

6
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:27,591
But the idea that there must be a real you,

7
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,634
surely that's obvious.

8
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:31,895
If there's anything real
in the world, it's you.

9
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,840
Well, I'm not quite sure.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,457
At least we have to understand
a bit better what that means.

11
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:40,291
Now certainly, I think there are
lots of things in our culture around us

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,498
which sort of reinforce the idea

13
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:46,249
that for each one of us,
we have a kind of a core, an essence.

14
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,683
There is something about what it means
to be you which defines you,

15
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,003
and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.

16
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,813
The most kind of crude way
in which we have it,

17
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,107
are things like horoscopes.

18
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,147
You know, people are very wedded
to these, actually.

19
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,111
People put them on their Facebook profile

20
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,594
as though they are meaningul,

21
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,271
you even know
your Chinese horoscope as well.

22
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:06,724
There are also
more scientific versions of this,

23
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:09,781
all sorts of ways of profiling
personality type,

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,454
such as the Myers-Briggs tests,
for example.

25
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:13,835
I don't know if you've done those.

26
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,739
A lot of companies
use these for recruitment.

27
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,036
You answer a lot of questions,

28
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:22,792
and this is supposed to reveal
something about your core personality.

29
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:26,093
And of course, the popular fascination
with this is enormous.

30
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,761
In magazines like this, you'll see,

31
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:31,223
in the bottom left corner,
they'll advertise in virtually every issue

32
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,333
some kind of personality thing.

33
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,113
And if you pick up one of those magazines,

34
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,361
it's hard to resist, isn't it?

35
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,226
Doing the test to find
what is your learning style,

36
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,354
what is your loving style,
or what is your working style?

37
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,954
Are you this kind of person or that?

38
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,987
So I think that we have a common-sense idea

39
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,634
that there is a kind of core
or essence of ourselves

40
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:53,168
to be discovered.

41
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,424
And that this is kind of a permanent truth
about ourselves,

42
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,864
something that's the same throughout life.

43
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:02,615
Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.

44
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:04,457
And I have to say now,
I'll say it a bit later,

45
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,285
but I'm not challenging this
just because I'm weird,

46
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:11,082
the challenge actually has a very,
very long and distinguished history.

47
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:13,251
Here's the common-sense idea.

48
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,287
There is you.

49
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,595
You are the individuals you are,
and you have this kind of core.

50
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:22,227
Now in your life, what happens
is that you, of course,

51
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,446
accumulate different experiences
and so forth.

52
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,716
So you have memories,

53
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,966
and these memories help
to create what you are.

54
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,623
You have desires, maybe for a cookie,

55
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:34,418
maybe for something
that we don't want to talk about

56
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,293
at 11 o'clock in the morning
in a school.

57
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:38,274
You will have beliefs.

58
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,187
This is a number plate
from someone in America.

59
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:42,959
I don't know whether this number plate,
which says "messiah 1,"

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,251
indicates that the driver
believes in the messiah,

61
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:47,445
or that they are the messiah.

62
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,158
Either way, they have beliefs
about messiahs.

63
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:51,620
We have knowledge.

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,878
We have sensations and experiences as well.

65
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,395
It's not just intellectual things.

66
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,998
So this is kind of
the common-sense model, I think,

67
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,150
of what a person is.

68
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,441
There is a person who has all the things
that make up our life experiences.

69
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,960
But the suggestion
I want to put to you today

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,395
is that there's something
fundamentally wrong with this model.

71
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,853
And I can show you what's wrong
with one click.

72
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:21,708
Which is there isn't actually a "you"
at the heart of all these experiences.

73
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,321
Strange thought?
Well, maybe not.

74
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,079
What is there, then?

75
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,348
Well, clearly there are memories,
desires, intentions, sensations,

76
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,291
and so forth.

77
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,549
But what happens is
these things exist,

78
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,618
and they're kind of all integrated,

79
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:38,407
they're overlapped, they're connected
in various different ways.

80
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,997
They're connecting partly,
and perhaps even mainly,

81
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:44,324
because they all belong to one body
and one brain.

82
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,387
But there's also a narrative,
a story we tell about ourselves,

83
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:50,282
the experiences we have
when we remember past things.

84
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:52,514
We do things because of other things.

85
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:56,126
So what we desire
is partly a result of what we believe,

86
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,692
and what we remember is also
informing us what we know.

87
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,354
And so really, there are all these things,

88
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:05,393
like beliefs, desires,
sensations, experiences,

89
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,823
they're all related to each other,

90
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,371
and that just is you.

91
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:16,208
In some ways, it's a small difference
from the common-sense understanding.

92
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,462
In some ways, it's a massive one.

93
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:20,638
It's the shift between thinking of yourself

94
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:24,034
as a thing which has
all the experiences of life,

95
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:26,977
and thinking of yourself
as simply that collection

96
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,999
of all experiences in life.

97
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,847
You are the sum of your parts.

98
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:33,969
Now those parts are also physical parts,
of course,

99
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,871
brains, bodies and legs and things,

100
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:38,174
but they aren't so important, actually.

101
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,847
If you have a heart transplant,
you're still the same person.

102
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,227
If you have a memory transplant,
are you the same person?

103
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:46,602
If you have a belief transplant,
would you be the same person?

104
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:51,501
Now this idea, that what we are,
the way to understand ourselves,

105
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:55,962
is as not of some permanent being,
which has experiences,

106
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,360
but is kind of a collection of experiences,

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,971
might strike you as kind of weird.

108
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,055
But actually, I don't think
it should be weird.

109
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,914
In a way, it's common sense.

110
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:09,215
Because I just invite you
to think about, by comparison,

111
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:12,172
think about pretty much anything else
in the universe,

112
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,922
maybe apart from the
very most fundamental forces or powers.

113
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,657
Let's take something like water.

114
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:20,198
Now my science isn't very good.

115
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:23,213
We might say something like
water has two parts hydrogen

116
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:25,099
and one parts oxygen, right?

117
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,747
We all know that.

118
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:30,212
I hope no one in this room
thinks that what that means

119
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:34,414
is there is a thing called water,
and attached to it

120
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:37,051
are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,

121
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,244
and that's what water is.

122
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,099
Of course we don't.

123
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,351
We understand, very easily,
very straightforwardly,

124
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,083
that water is nothing more

125
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:49,117
than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules
suitably arranged.

126
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,030
Everything else in the universe is the same.

127
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,199
There's no mystery about my watch,
for example.

128
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,562
We say the watch has a face, and hands,

129
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,362
and a mechanism and a battery,

130
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,523
But what we really mean is,

131
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,128
we don't think
there is a thing called the watch

132
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,861
to which we then attach all these bits.

133
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,897
We understand very clearly
that you get the parts of the watch,

134
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,994
you put them together,
and you create a watch.

135
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,638
Now if everything else
in the universe is like this,

136
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:15,944
why are we different?

137
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,508
Why think of ourselves

138
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:21,460
as somehow not just being
a collection of all our parts,

139
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,328
but somehow being a separate,
permanent entity which has those parts?

140
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:29,438
Now this view is not particularly new,
actually.

141
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:31,113
It has quite a long lineage.

142
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,463
You find it in Buddhism,

143
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:35,009
you find it in 17th,
18th-century philosophy

144
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,604
going through to the current day,
people like Locke and Hume.

145
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,687
But interestingly, it's also a view

146
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:44,731
increasingly being heard reinforced
by neuroscience.

147
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:48,375
This is Paul Broks,
he's a clinical neuropsychologist,

148
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,574
and he says this:

149
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,956
"We have a deep intuition
that there is a core,

150
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,505
an essence there,
and it's hard to shake off,

151
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:57,516
probably impossible to shake off,
I suspect.

152
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:01,443
But it's true that neuroscience shows
that there is no centre in the brain

153
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,733
where things do all come together."

154
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,203
So when you look at the brain,

155
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:10,220
and you look at how the brain
makes possible a sense of self,

156
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,004
you find that there isn't
a central control spot in the brain.

157
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:17,303
There is no kind of center
where everything happens.

158
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,888
There are lots of different processes
in the brain,

159
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,987
all of which operate, in a way,
quite independently.

160
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:26,097
But it's because of the way
that they relate

161
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,958
that we get this sense of self.

162
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,447
The term I use in the book,
I call it the ego trick.

163
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:37,106
It's like a mechanical trick.

164
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,586
It's not that we don't exist,

165
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:42,870
it's just that the trick is
to make us feel that inside of us

166
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,356
is something more unified
than is really there.

167
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,493
Now you might think
this is a worrying idea.

168
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:51,825
You might think that if it's true,

169
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:55,576
that for each one of us there is
no abiding core of self,

170
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,561
no permanent essence,

171
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,493
does that mean that really,
the self is an illusion?

172
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:03,807
Does it mean that we really don't exist?

173
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,615
There is no real you.

174
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,696
Well, a lot of people actually do use
this talk of illusion and so forth.

175
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,674
These are three psychologists,
Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,

176
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,978
Susan Blackmore,

177
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:17,963
a lot of these people do talk
the language of illusion,

178
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,029
the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.

179
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,075
But I don't think this is
a very helpful way of looking at it.

180
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:23,852
Go back to the watch.

181
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:27,904
The watch isn't an illusion,
because there is nothing to the watch

182
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:30,152
other than a collection of its parts.

183
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,109
In the same way,
we're not illusions either.

184
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:37,552
The fact that we are, in some ways,
just this very, very complex collection,

185
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,137
ordered collection of things,

186
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,012
does not mean we're not real.

187
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,911
I can give you
a very sort of rough metaphor for this.

188
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,516
Let's take something like a waterfall.

189
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:50,123
These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.

190
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:52,625
Now if you take something like this,

191
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,919
you can appreciate the fact
that in lots of ways,

192
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,029
there's nothing permanent about this.

193
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,462
For one thing, it's always changing.

194
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:02,309
The waters
are always carving new channels.

195
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,600
with changes and tides and the weather,

196
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,024
some things dry up,
new things are created.

197
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:12,511
Of course the water that flows
through the waterfall

198
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,413
is different every single instance.

199
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,165
But it doesn't mean that
the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.

200
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:19,798
It doesn't mean it's not real.

201
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:23,132
What it means is we have
to understand what it is

202
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,361
as something which has a history,

203
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:28,003
has certain things that keep it together,

204
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:30,799
but it's a process, it's fluid,
it's forever changing.

205
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,531
Now that, I think, is a model
for understanding ourselves,

206
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,195
and I think it's a liberating model.

207
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:39,231
Because if you think that you have
this fixed, permanent essence,

208
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:42,237
which is always the same,
throughout your life, no matter what,

209
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,807
in a sense you're kind of trapped.

210
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,418
You're born with an essence,

211
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:50,101
that's what you are until you die,

212
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:53,130
if you believe in an afterlife,
maybe you continue.

213
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,100
But if you think of yourself
as being, in a way,

214
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,880
not a thing as such,
but a kind of a process,

215
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,407
something that is changing,

216
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:02,944
then I think that's quite liberating.

217
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:05,812
Because unlike the the waterfalls,

218
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,307
we actually have the capacity to channel

219
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,929
the direction of our development for ourselves
to a certain degree.

220
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:14,302
Now we've got to be careful here, right?

221
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:17,392
If you watch the X-Factor too much,
you might buy into this idea

222
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,721
that we can all be whatever we want to be.

223
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:21,039
That's not true.

224
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,209
I've heard some fantastic musicians
this morning,

225
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,927
and I am very confident
that I could in no way be as good as them.

226
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,324
I could practice hard
and maybe be good,

227
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:32,328
but I don't have
that really natural ability.

228
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:34,985
There are limits to what we can achieve.

229
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,460
There are limits to what
we can make of ourselves.

230
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,122
But nevertheless, we do have
this capacity

231
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:44,112
to, in a sense, shape ourselves.

232
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,368
The true self, as it were then,

233
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:50,429
is not something that is just there
for you to discover,

234
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,078
you don't sort of look into your soul
and find your true self,

235
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,899
What you are partly doing, at least,

236
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,290
is actually creating your true self.

237
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,213
And this, I think, is very,
very significant,

238
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,179
particularly at this stage of life you're at.

239
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,578
You'll be aware of the fact

240
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,132
how much of you changed over recent years.

241
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,371
If you have any videos of yourself,
three or four years ago,

242
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,651
you probably feel embarrassed
because you don't recognize yourself.

243
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,532
So I want to get that message over,
that what we need to do

244
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,592
is think about ourselves as things
that we can shape,

245
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,645
and channel and change.

246
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,941
This is the Buddha, again:

247
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,360
"Well-makers lead the water,

248
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,761
fletchers bend the arrow,

249
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,226
carpenters bend a log of wood,

250
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:31,000
wise people fashion themselves."

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,461
And that's the idea
I want to leave you with,

252
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:39,668
that your true self is not something
that you will have to go searching for,

253
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,873
as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.

254
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,574
To the extent you have a true self,

255
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,308
it's something that you in part discover,

256
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,701
but in part create.

257
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:54,197
and that, I think,
is a liberating and exciting prospect.

258
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,313
Thank you very much.
