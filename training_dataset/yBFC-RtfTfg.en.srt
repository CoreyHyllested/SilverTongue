0
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,223
Along the ancient path
of the Monongahela River,

1
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:22,981
Braddock, Pennsylvania sits
in the eastern region of Allegheny County,

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,348
approximately nine miles
outside of Pittsburgh.

3
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,829
An industrial suburb,

4
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,570
Braddock is home
to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill,

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,238
the Edgar Thomson Works.

6
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,560
Operating since 1875,

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,738
it is the last functioning
steel mill in the region.

8
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,101
For 12 years, I have produced
collaborative portraits,

9
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:54,373
still lifes, landscapes and aerial views

10
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:59,724
in order to build a visual archive
to address the intersection

11
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,571
of the steel industry,

12
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,429
the environment,

13
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:10,071
and the health care system's impact
on the bodies of my family and community.

14
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:14,644
The tradition and grand
narrative of Braddock

15
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:20,439
is mostly comprised of stories
of industrialists and trade unions.

16
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:25,027
Currently, the new narrative
about Braddock,

17
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:28,564
a poster child for Rust Belt
revitalization,

18
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:33,548
is a story of urban pioneers
discovering a new frontier.

19
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:40,131
Mass media has omitted the fact
that Braddock is predominantly black.

20
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:46,640
Our existence has been co-opted,
silenced and erased.

21
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,967
Fourth generation in a lineage of women,

22
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:56,657
I was raised under the protection
and care of Grandma Ruby,

23
00:01:56,657 --> 00:02:01,032
off 8th Street
at 805 Washington Avenue.

24
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:06,120
She worked as a manager for Goodwill.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,814
Mom was a nurse's aid.

26
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:15,161
She watched the steel mills close
and white flight to suburban developments.

27
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,332
By the time my generation
walked the streets,

28
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:24,586
disinvestment at the local,
state and federal level,

29
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,483
eroded infrastructure,

30
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:32,764
and the War on Drugs
dismantled my family and community.

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,305
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps

32
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:40,994
was one of few black men to retire
from Carnegie's mill with his pension.

33
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,201
He worked in high temperatures,

34
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:48,930
tearing down and rebuilding furnaces,
cleaning up spilt metal and slag.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:56,039
The history of a place is written
on the body and the landscape.

36
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,244
Areas of heavy truck traffic,

37
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:04,609
exposure to benzene and atomized metals,

38
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,742
risk cancer and lupus.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,847
One hundred twenty-three licensed beds,
652 employees,

40
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:20,349
rehabilitation programs decimated.

41
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:27,363
A housing discrimination lawsuit
against Allegheny County

42
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:33,215
removed where the projects
Talbot Towers once stood.

43
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:38,957
Recent rezoning for more light industry
has since appeared.

44
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:45,595
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations
conceal the flammable waste

45
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:50,890
being used to squeeze the Bunn family
off their home and land.

46
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,545
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter

47
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:03,101
with my cameras to document
this aggressive dispossession.

48
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:10,252
In flight, my observation reveals
thousands of plastic white bundles

49
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:13,728
owned by a conservation industry

50
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,981
that claims it's eco-friendly

51
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,697
and recycles millions of tires

52
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:21,484
to preserve people's lives

53
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:24,560
and to improve people's lives.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,461
My work spirals from the micro
to the macro level,

55
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,688
excavating hidden histories.

56
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,196
Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum,

57
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:40,166
Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition,

58
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:46,133
and the exhibition was used
as a platform to launch his voice.

59
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,820
Through reclamation of our narrative,

60
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,319
we will continue to fight historic erasure
and socioeconomic inequality.

61
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,370
Thank you.

62
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,400
(Applause)
