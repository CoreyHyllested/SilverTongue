00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:15,482
Just after Christmas last year,

1
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,320
132 kids in California got the measles

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,333
by either visiting Disneyland

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,282
or being exposed to someone
who'd been there.

4
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:27,486
The virus then hopped the Canadian border,

5
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,922
infecting more than
100 children in Quebec.

6
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:33,871
One of the tragic things
about this outbreak

7
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:39,490
is that measles, which can be fatal
to a child with a weakened immune system,

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,275
is one of the most easily
preventable diseases in the world.

9
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:45,272
An effective vaccine against it

10
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:48,638
has been available for more
than half a century,

11
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:51,912
but many of the kids involved
in the Disneyland outbreak

12
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,886
had not been vaccinated

13
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,138
because their parents were afraid

14
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:59,157
of something allegedly even worse:

15
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,875
autism.

16
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,658
But wait -- wasn't the paper
that sparked the controversy

17
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,981
about autism and vaccines

18
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:08,978
debunked, retracted,

19
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:11,450
and branded a deliberate fraud

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,158
by the British Medical Journal?

21
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,201
Don't most science-savvy people

22
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,520
know that the theory
that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,377
I think most of you do,

24
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,955
but millions of parents worldwide

25
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:28,573
continue to fear that vaccines
put their kids at risk for autism.

26
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,047
Why?

27
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:32,290
Here's why.

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,375
This is a graph of autism
prevalence estimates rising over time.

29
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,488
For most of the 20th century,

30
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:43,180
autism was considered
an incredibly rare condition.

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,500
The few psychologists and pediatricians
who'd even heard of it

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,217
figured they would get through
their entire careers

33
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,724
without seeing a single case.

34
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:55,602
For decades, the prevalence estimates
remained stable

35
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:58,853
at just three or four children in 10,000.

36
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,919
But then, in the 1990s,

37
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,380
the numbers started to skyrocket.

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,608
Fundraising organizations
like Autism Speaks

39
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:09,696
routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,

40
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,365
as if you could catch it
from another kid at Disneyland.

41
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:14,967
So what's going on?

42
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,194
If it isn't vaccines, what is it?

43
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:22,165
If you ask the folks down at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta

44
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,860
what's going on,

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,370
they tend to rely on phrases like
"broadened diagnostic criteria"

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,134
and "better case finding"

47
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,711
to explain these rising numbers.

48
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,731
But that kind of language

49
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,680
doesn't do much to allay
the fears of a young mother

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,324
who is searching her
two-year-old's face for eye contact.

51
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:45,319
If the diagnostic criteria
had to be broadened,

52
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,152
why were they so narrow
in the first place?

53
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:51,147
Why were cases of autism
so hard to find

54
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,437
before the 1990s?

55
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:59,172
Five years ago, I decided to try
to uncover the answers to these questions.

56
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,216
I learned that what happened

57
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:05,116
has less to do with the slow and cautious
progress of science

58
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:08,354
than it does with the seductive
power of storytelling.

59
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,750
For most of the 20th century,

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,211
clinicians told one story

61
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,763
about what autism is
and how it was discovered,

62
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,573
but that story turned out to be wrong,

63
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,384
and the consequences of it

64
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:25,285
are having a devastating impact
on global public health.

65
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,814
There was a second,
more accurate story of autism

66
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,430
which had been lost and forgotten

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,410
in obscure corners
of the clinical literature.

68
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,427
This second story tells us everything
about how we got here

69
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,032
and where we need to go next.

70
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:45,996
The first story starts with a child
psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital

71
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,946
named Leo Kanner.

72
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:51,499
In 1943, Kanner published a paper

73
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:56,212
describing 11 young patients
who seemed to inhabit private worlds,

74
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,302
ignoring the people around them,

75
00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:00,462
even their own parents.

76
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:02,737
They could amuse themselves for hours

77
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,384
by flapping their hands
in front of their faces,

78
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,358
but they were panicked by little things

79
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:10,970
like their favorite toy
being moved from its usual place

80
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,977
without their knowledge.

81
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:15,693
Based on the patients
who were brought to his clinic,

82
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:19,269
Kanner speculated
that autism is very rare.

83
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,727
By the 1950s, as the world's
leading authority on the subject,

84
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:29,300
he declared that he had seen
less than 150 true cases of his syndrome

85
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,363
while fielding referrals from
as far away as South Africa.

86
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:35,754
That's actually not surprising,

87
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:39,130
because Kanner's criteria
for diagnosing autism

88
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,443
were incredibly selective.

89
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:46,621
For example, he discouraged giving
the diagnosis to children who had seizures

90
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,382
but now we know that epilepsy
is very common in autism.

91
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:53,424
He once bragged that he had turned
nine out of 10 kids

92
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:57,255
referred to his office as autistic
by other clinicians

93
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,883
without giving them an autism diagnosis.

94
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,944
Kanner was a smart guy,

95
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,113
but a number of his theories
didn't pan out.

96
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:08,888
He classified autism as a form
of infantile psychosis

97
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:12,858
caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.

98
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:14,995
These children, he said,

99
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:19,313
had been kept neatly
in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.

100
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:21,264
At the same time, however,

101
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:24,189
Kanner noticed that some
of his young patients

102
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,602
had special abilities
that clustered in certain areas

103
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:30,853
like music, math and memory.

104
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,734
One boy in his clinic

105
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:37,328
could distinguish between 18 symphonies
before he turned two.

106
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,443
When his mother put on
one of his favorite records,

107
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:43,809
he would correctly declare,
"Beethoven!"

108
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,665
But Kanner took a dim view
of these abilities,

109
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:50,242
claiming that the kids
were just regurgitating things

110
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,865
they'd heard their pompous parents say,

111
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:55,465
desperate to earn their approval.

112
00:05:55,465 --> 00:06:00,829
As a result, autism became
a source of shame and stigma for families,

113
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,406
and two generations of autistic children

114
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,889
were shipped off to institutions
for their own good,

115
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,163
becoming invisible to the world at large.

116
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:14,400
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,567
that researchers began to test
Kanner's theory that autism was rare.

118
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,305
Lorna Wing was a cognitive
psychologist in London

119
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:26,509
who thought that Kanner's theory
of refrigerator parenting

120
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,528
were "bloody stupid," as she told me.

121
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:33,707
She and her husband John were warm
and affectionate people,

122
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,520
and they had a profoundly
autistic daughter named Susie.

123
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,822
Lorna and John knew how hard it was
to raise a child like Susie

124
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,784
without support services,

125
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:45,386
special education,

126
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:49,635
and the other resources that are
out of reach without a diagnosis.

127
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:52,259
To make the case
to the National Health Service

128
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,507
that more resources were needed
for autistic children and their families,

129
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,643
Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould

130
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:04,193
decided to do something that should
have been done 30 years earlier.

131
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:09,139
They undertook a study of autism
prevalence in the general population.

132
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,435
They pounded the pavement
in a London suburb called Camberwell

133
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:17,100
to try to find autistic children
in the community.

134
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,767
What they saw made clear
that Kanner's model was way too narrow,

135
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:26,293
while the reality of autism
was much more colorful and diverse.

136
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,806
Some kids couldn't talk at all,

137
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:33,542
while others waxed on at length
about their fascination with astrophysics,

138
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:37,486
dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.

139
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:42,176
In other words, these children
didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,

140
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:43,871
as Judith put it,

141
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,752
and they saw lots of them,

142
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:49,537
way more than Kanner's monolithic model
would have predicted.

143
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,252
At first, they were at a loss
to make sense of their data.

144
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,380
How had no one noticed
these children before?

145
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,899
But then Lorna came upon a reference
to a paper that had been published

146
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,554
in German in 1944,

147
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,899
the year after Kanner's paper,

148
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,617
and then forgotten,

149
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:09,194
buried with the ashes of a terrible time

150
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:12,445
that no one wanted to remember
or think about.

151
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:15,115
Kanner knew about this competing paper,

152
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:19,860
but scrupulously avoided
mentioning it in his own work.

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,322
It had never even
been translated into English,

154
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:25,285
but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,

155
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,932
and he translated it for her.

156
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:31,624
The paper offered
an alternate story of autism.

157
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,317
Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,

158
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:37,591
who ran a combination clinic
and residential school

159
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,331
in Vienna in the 1930s.

160
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:44,302
Asperger's ideas about teaching children
with learning differences

161
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:47,436
were progressive even
by contemporary standards.

162
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:51,848
Mornings at his clinic began
with exercise classes set to music,

163
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:55,354
and the children put on plays
on Sunday afternoons.

164
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:58,349
Instead of blaming parents
for causing autism,

165
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:03,202
Asperger framed it as a lifelong,
polygenetic disability

166
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:07,103
that requires compassionate forms
of support and accommodations

167
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:10,510
over the course of one's whole life.

168
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,395
Rather than treating the kids
in his clinic like patients,

169
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:16,460
Asperger called them
his little professors,

170
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,245
and enlisted their help in developing
methods of education

171
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:22,729
that were particularly suited to them.

172
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:28,460
Crucially, Asperger viewed autism
as a diverse continuum

173
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,114
that spans an astonishing range
of giftedness and disability.

174
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:37,116
He believed that autism
and autistic traits are common

175
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,982
and always have been,

176
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:44,276
seeing aspects of this continuum
in familiar archetypes from pop culture

177
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,612
like the socially awkward scientist

178
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,306
and the absent-minded professor.

179
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,419
He went so far as to say,

180
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,646
it seems that for success
in science and art,

181
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:57,592
a dash of autism is essential.

182
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:03,214
Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner
had been as wrong about autism being rare

183
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,907
as he had been about parents causing it.

184
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,951
Over the next several years,

185
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,364
they quietly worked with
the American Psychiatric Association

186
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:13,964
to broaden the criteria for diagnosis

187
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:17,981
to reflect the diversity of what
they called "the autism spectrum."

188
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,559
In the late '80s and early 1990s,

189
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,857
their changes went into effect,

190
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,226
swapping out Kanner's narrow model

191
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:28,801
for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.

192
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,472
These changes weren't
happening in a vacuum.

193
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:35,326
By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith
worked behind the scenes

194
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,160
to reform the criteria,

195
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,176
people all over the world were seeing
an autistic adult for the first time.

196
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,550
Before "Rain Man" came out in 1988,

197
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,209
only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts
knew what autism looked like,

198
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,969
but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable
performance as Raymond Babbitt

199
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:58,104
earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,

200
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,844
pediatricians, psychologists,

201
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:05,534
teachers and parents all over the world
knew what autism looked like.

202
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,459
Coincidentally, at the same time,

203
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,589
the first easy-to-use clinical tests
for diagnosing autism were introduced.

204
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,629
You no longer had to have a connection
to that tiny circle of experts

205
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,207
to get your child evaluated.

206
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,320
The combination of "Rain Man,"

207
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,499
the changes to the criteria,
and the introduction of these tests

208
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,774
created a network effect,

209
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,304
a perfect storm of autism awareness.

210
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:36,322
The number of diagnoses started to soar,

211
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:41,990
just as Lorna and Judith predicted,
indeed hoped, that it would,

212
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,106
enabling autistic people
and their families

213
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:47,798
to finally get the support
and services they deserved.

214
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,864
Then Andrew Wakefield came along

215
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:53,719
to blame the spike
in diagnoses on vaccines,

216
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,832
a simple, powerful,

217
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,618
and seductively believable story

218
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,986
that was as wrong as Kanner's theory

219
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,239
that autism was rare.

220
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:06,710
If the CDC's current estimate,

221
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,133
that one in 68 kids in America
are on the spectrum, is correct,

222
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:15,340
autistics are one of the largest
minority groups in the world.

223
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,167
In recent years, autistic people
have come together on the Internet

224
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,812
to reject the notion that they
are puzzles to be solved

225
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,995
by the next medical breakthrough,

226
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,456
coining the term "neurodiversity"

227
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,744
to celebrate the varieties
of human cognition.

228
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,655
One way to understand neurodiversity

229
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:37,324
is to think in terms
of human operating systems.

230
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:42,240
Just because a P.C. is not running Windows
doesn't mean that it's broken.

231
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,869
By autistic standards,
the normal human brain

232
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,889
is easily distractable,

233
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,677
obsessively social,

234
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:52,997
and suffers from a deficit
of attention to detail.

235
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,992
To be sure, autistic people
have a hard time

236
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,268
living in a world not built for them.

237
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:02,520
[Seventy] years later, we're still
catching up to Asperger,

238
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,603
who believed that the "cure"
for the most disabling aspects of autism

239
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:09,529
is to be found in understanding teachers,

240
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,665
accommodating employers,

241
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,522
supportive communities,

242
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:16,866
and parents who have faith
in their children's potential.

243
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:19,908
An autistic [man]
named Zosia Zaks once said,

244
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:25,211
"We need all hands on deck
to right the ship of humanity."

245
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,764
As we sail into an uncertain future,

246
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:31,502
we need every form
of human intelligence on the planet

247
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:37,469
working together to tackle
the challenges that we face as a society.

248
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,791
We can't afford to waste a brain.

249
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,136
Thank you.

250
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:46,136
(Applause)
