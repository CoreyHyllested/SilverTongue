00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:14,715
Last year,

1
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:17,246
three of my family members
were gruesomely murdered

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,713
in a hate crime.

3
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,428
It goes without saying
that it's really difficult

4
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:24,175
for me to be here today,

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,782
but my brother Deah,

6
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,222
his wife Yusor,

7
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,777
and her sister Razan

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,510
don't give me much of a choice.

9
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,663
I'm hopeful that by the end
of this talk you will make a choice,

10
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:37,130
and join me in standing up against hate.

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,746
It's December 27, 2014:

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,002
the morning of my brother's wedding day.

13
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:46,090
He asks me to come over and comb his hair

14
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,254
in preparation
for his wedding photo shoot.

15
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:53,947
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball,
particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,874
(Laughter)

17
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,830
An American kid in dental school
ready to take on the world.

18
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:04,482
When Deah and Yusor
have their first dance,

19
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,312
I see the love in his eyes,

20
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:07,966
her reciprocated joy,

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,277
and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.

22
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,945
I move to the back of the hall
and burst into tears.

23
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,545
And the second the song finishes playing,

24
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,756
he beelines towards me,

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,031
buries me into his arms

26
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,475
and rocks me back and forth.

27
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,123
Even in that moment,

28
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:24,024
when everything was so distracting,

29
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:25,901
he was attuned to me.

30
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,756
He cups my face and says,

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,960
"Suzanne,

32
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:31,268
I am who I am because of you.

33
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,843
Thank you for everything.

34
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,038
I love you."

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,663
About a month later, I'm back home
in North Carolina for a short visit,

36
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,398
and on the last evening,
I run upstairs to Deah's room,

37
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:48,717
eager to find out how he's feeling
being a newly married man.

38
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,042
With a big boyish smile he says,

39
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:54,780
"I'm so happy. I love her.
She's an amazing girl."

40
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,438
And she is.

41
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:59,840
At just 21, she'd recently
been accepted to join Deah

42
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:01,439
at UNC dental school.

43
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:05,249
She shared his love for basketball,
and at her urging,

44
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:09,196
they started their honeymoon off
attending their favorite team of the NBA,

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,625
the LA Lakers.

46
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,401
I mean, check out that form.

47
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:15,652
(Laughter)

48
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:22,004
I'll never forget that moment
sitting there with him --

49
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:24,528
how free he was in his happiness.

50
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:27,017
My littler brother,
a basketball-obsessed kid,

51
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,847
had become and transformed
into an accomplished young man.

52
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,599
He was at the top
of his dental school class,

53
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,200
and alongside Yusor and Razan,

54
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:39,440
was involved in local and international
community service projects

55
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:41,793
dedicated to the homeless and refugees,

56
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,104
including a dental relief trip
they were planning

57
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,026
for Syrian refugees in Turkey.

58
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,796
Razan, at just 19,

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,974
used her creativity
as an architectural engineering student

60
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,689
to serve those around her,

61
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,960
making care packages
for the local homeless,

62
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,650
among other projects.

63
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,631
That is who they were.

64
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:02,663
Standing there that night,

65
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,628
I take a deep breath
and look at Deah and tell him,

66
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,141
"I have never been more proud of you
than I am in this moment."

67
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,380
He pulls me into his tall frame,

68
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,567
hugs me goodnight,

69
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,821
and I leave the next morning
without waking him

70
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,285
to go back to San Francisco.

71
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,245
That is the last time I ever hug him.

72
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:25,615
Ten days later, I'm on call
at San Francisco General Hospital

73
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,485
when I receive a barrage of vague
text messages expressing condolences.

74
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,317
Confused, I call my father,
who calmly intones,

75
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:35,342
"There's been a shooting
in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.

76
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,358
It's on lock-down. That's all we know."

77
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,822
I hang up and quickly Google,
"shooting in Chapel Hill."

78
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,877
One hit comes up.

79
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,323
Quote:

80
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,608
"Three people were shot
in the back of the head

81
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,376
and confirmed dead on the scene."

82
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,466
Something in me just knows.

83
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,610
I fling out of my chair and faint
onto the gritty hospital floor,

84
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,884
wailing.

85
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,757
I take the first red-eye
out of San Francisco,

86
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,018
numb and disoriented.

87
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:02,948
I walk into my childhood home
and faint into my parents' arms,

88
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,154
sobbing.

89
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,096
I then run up to Deah's room
as I did so many times before,

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,168
just looking for him,

91
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,785
only to find a void
that will never be filled.

92
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,006
Investigation and autopsy reports
eventually revealed

93
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,549
the sequence of events.

94
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,776
Deah had just gotten
off the bus from class,

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,379
Razan was visiting for dinner,

96
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:27,978
already at home with Yusor.

97
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,384
As they began to eat,
they heard a knock on the door.

98
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,436
When Deah opened it,

99
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,211
their neighbor proceeded
to fire multiple shots at him.

100
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:40,317
According to 911 calls,

101
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,378
the girls were heard screaming.

102
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,173
The man turned towards the kitchen
and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,

103
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,347
immobilizing her.

104
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,139
He then approached her from behind,

105
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,408
pressed the barrel of his gun
against her head,

106
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:55,147
and with a single bullet,
lacerated her midbrain.

107
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,454
He then turned towards Razan,
who was screaming for her life,

108
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,640
and, execution-style, with a single bullet

109
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,368
to the back of the head,

110
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,572
killed her.

111
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,905
On his way out,

112
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:12,206
he shot Deah one last time --
a bullet in the mouth --

113
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,081
for a total of eight bullets:

114
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,959
two lodged in the head,

115
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,494
two in his chest

116
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,548
and the rest in his extremities.

117
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,662
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed

118
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:27,044
in a place that was meant
to be safe: their home.

119
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,315
For months, this man
had been harassing them:

120
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,744
knocking on their door,

121
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,200
brandishing his gun
on a couple of occasions.

122
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,624
His Facebook was cluttered
with anti-religion posts.

123
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:40,950
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.

124
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,471
As she was moving in,

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,998
he told Yusor and her mom
that he didn't like the way they looked.

126
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,281
In response, Yusor's mom told her
to be kind to her neighbor,

127
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:53,662
that as he got to know them,

128
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,429
he'd see them for who they were.

129
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,796
I guess we've all become
so numb to the hatred

130
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,355
that we couldn't have ever imagined
it turning into fatal violence.

131
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:08,656
The man who murdered my brother
turned himself in to the police

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,492
shortly after the murders,

133
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,746
saying he killed three kids,

134
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,317
execution-style,

135
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,066
over a parking dispute.

136
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,204
The police issued a premature
public statement that morning,

137
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:22,672
echoing his claims
without bothering to question it

138
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,147
or further investigate.

139
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:27,750
It turns out there was no parking dispute.

140
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:29,380
There was no argument.

141
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,682
No violation.

142
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:32,852
But the damage was already done.

143
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,382
In a 24-hour media cycle,

144
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:38,843
the words "parking dispute" had already
become the go-to sound bite.

145
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:44,173
I sit on my brother's bed
and remember his words,

146
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:48,002
the words he gave me
so freely and with so much love,

147
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,257
"I am who I am because of you."

148
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,956
That's what it takes for me
to climb through my crippling grief

149
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,137
and speak out.

150
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,943
I cannot let my family's deaths
be diminished to a segment

151
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,065
that is barely discussed on local news.

152
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,159
They were murdered by their neighbor
because of their faith,

153
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,641
because of a piece of cloth
they chose to don on their heads,

154
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,658
because they were visibly Muslim.

155
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,419
Some of the rage I felt at the time

156
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,364
was that if roles were reversed,

157
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:21,203
and an Arab, Muslim
or Muslim-appearing person

158
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:26,081
had killed three white American
college students execution-style,

159
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,261
in their home,

160
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,779
what would we have called it?

161
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,492
A terrorist attack.

162
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:35,475
When white men commit
acts of violence in the US,

163
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:36,719
they're lone wolves,

164
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:37,933
mentally ill

165
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,781
or driven by a parking dispute.

166
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,911
I know that I have to give
my family voice,

167
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:48,131
and I do the only thing I know how:

168
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:50,970
I send a Facebook message
to everyone I know in media.

169
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,704
A couple of hours later,

170
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:58,522
in the midst of a chaotic house
overflowing with friends and family,

171
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:01,596
our neighbor Neal comes over,
sits down next to my parents

172
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,749
and asks, "What can I do?"

173
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:08,535
Neal had over two decades
of experience in journalism,

174
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,964
but he makes it clear that he's not
there in his capacity as journalist,

175
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,841
but as a neighbor who wants to help.

176
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,208
I ask him what he thinks we should do,

177
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:19,286
given the bombardment
of local media interview requests.

178
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,122
He offers to set up a press conference
at a local community center.

179
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,867
Even now I don't have
the words to thank him.

180
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,345
"Just tell me when, and I'll have
all the news channels present," he said.

181
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,138
He did for us what we
could not do for ourselves

182
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:36,814
in a moment of devastation.

183
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,332
I delivered the press statement,

184
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,483
still wearing scrubs
from the previous night.

185
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,518
And in under 24 hours from the murders,

186
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:46,291
I'm on CNN being interviewed
by Anderson Cooper.

187
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,902
The following day, major newspapers --

188
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,677
including the New York Times,
Chicago Tribune --

189
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,332
published stories about Deah,
Yusor and Razan,

190
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:56,531
allowing us to reclaim the narrative

191
00:08:56,555 --> 00:09:00,048
and call attention the mainstreaming
of anti-Muslim hatred.

192
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,491
These days,

193
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:09,095
it feels like Islamophobia
is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.

194
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,299
We just have to put up with it and smile.

195
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,503
The nasty stares,

196
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,930
the palpable fear when boarding a plane,

197
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:21,250
the random pat downs at airports
that happen 99 percent of the time.

198
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:23,495
It doesn't stop there.

199
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,264
We have politicians reaping political
and financial gains off our backs.

200
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,448
Here in the US,

201
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,839
we have presidential candidates
like Donald Trump,

202
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,266
casually calling to register
American Muslims,

203
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,725
and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees
from entering this country.

204
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:41,077
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise

205
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,590
in parallel with election cycles.

206
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,032
Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,

207
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,856
a Lebanese-American Christian,

208
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,636
was murdered in Oklahoma
by his neighbor --

209
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,910
a man who called him a "filthy Arab."

210
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:59,338
This man was previously jailed
for a mere 8 months,

211
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:02,485
after attempting run over
Khalid's mother with his car.

212
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:06,481
Chances are you haven't heard
Khalid's story,

213
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,860
because it didn't make it
to national news.

214
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:12,005
The least we can do is call it what it is:

215
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,345
a hate crime.

216
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:15,607
The least we can do is talk about it,

217
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:19,563
because violence and hatred
doesn't just happen in a vacuum.

218
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,454
Not long after coming back to work,

219
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,456
I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,

220
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,096
when one of my patients
looks over at my colleague,

221
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,673
gestures around her face
and says, "San Bernardino,"

222
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,674
referencing a recent terrorist attack.

223
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:40,160
Here I am having just lost three
family members to Islamophobia,

224
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,356
having been a vocal advocate
within my program

225
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,607
on how to deal with such microaggressions,

226
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:45,790
and yet --

227
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,976
silence.

228
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:48,801
I was disheartened.

229
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,539
Humiliated.

230
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,348
Days later rounding on the same patient,

231
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,688
she looks at me and says,

232
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:57,802
"Your people are killing
people in Los Angeles."

233
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:01,279
I look around expectantly.

234
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,624
Again:

235
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:03,848
silence.

236
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,595
I realize that yet again,

237
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,394
I have to speak up for myself.

238
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,284
I sit on her bed and gently ask her,

239
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:16,277
"Have I ever done anything
but treat you with respect and kindness?

240
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,581
Have I done anything but give
you compassionate care?"

241
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:23,578
She looks down and realizes
what she said was wrong,

242
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,337
and in front of the entire team,

243
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,877
she apologizes and says,

244
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,487
"I should know better.
I'm Mexican-American.

245
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,943
I receive this kind
of treatment all the time."

246
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,618
Many of us experience
microaggressions on a daily basis.

247
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,501
Odds are you may have experienced it,

248
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,924
whether for your race,

249
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,099
gender,

250
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,274
sexuality

251
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:46,707
or religious beliefs.

252
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,864
We've all been in situations
where we've witnessed something wrong

253
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,148
and didn't speak up.

254
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:54,829
Maybe we weren't equipped
with the tools to respond in the moment.

255
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:58,289
Maybe we weren't even aware
of our own implicit biases.

256
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:02,585
We can all agree that bigotry
is unacceptable,

257
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:03,814
but when we see it,

258
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:05,005
we're silent,

259
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,810
because it makes us uncomfortable.

260
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,988
But stepping right into that discomfort

261
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,580
means you are also stepping
into the ally zone.

262
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:16,648
There may be over three million
Muslims in America.

263
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:19,747
That's still just one percent
of the total population.

264
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:22,567
Martin Luther King once said,

265
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,931
"In the end,

266
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,461
we will remember not
the words of our enemies,

267
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:29,239
but the silence of our friends."

268
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,688
So what made my neighbor
Neal's allyship so profound?

269
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:38,633
A couple of things.

270
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,327
He was there as a neighbor who cared,

271
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,543
but he was also bringing in
his professional expertise and resources

272
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,110
when the moment called for it.

273
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,548
Others have done the same.

274
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,574
Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform

275
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:55,086
as the first tenured African-American
professor at Wheaton College

276
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,764
to wear a hijab in solidarity

277
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:59,614
with Muslim women who face
discrimination every day.

278
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,483
As a result, she lost her job.

279
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:04,971
Within a month,

280
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,518
she joined the faculty
at the University of Virginia,

281
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:11,183
where she now works on pluralism,
race, faith and culture.

282
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,922
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,

283
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:18,674
demonstrated that not all active
allyship needs to be so serious.

284
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:21,933
He stepped up to support
a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission

285
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:24,004
to introduce a hijab emoji.

286
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,541
(Laughter)

287
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,624
It's a simple gesture,

288
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:30,185
but it has a significant
subconscious impact

289
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,448
on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,

290
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:36,117
including the community
as a part of an "us"

291
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,825
instead of an "other."

292
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,669
The editor in chief
of Women's Running magazine

293
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:45,780
just put the first hijabi to ever be
on the cover of a US fitness magazine.

294
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,763
These are all very different examples

295
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,742
of people who drew upon
their platforms and resources

296
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,099
in academia, tech and media,

297
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:56,312
to actively express their allyship.

298
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,690
What resources and expertise
do you bring to the table?

299
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:03,665
Are you willing to step
into your discomfort

300
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,201
and speak up when you witness
hateful bigotry?

301
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,173
Will you be Neal?

302
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:11,552
Many neighbors appeared in this story.

303
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:15,344
And you, in your respective communities,
all have a Muslim neighbor,

304
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,521
colleague

305
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,876
or friend your child plays with at school.

306
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,368
Reach out to them.

307
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,968
Let them know you stand
with them in solidarity.

308
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:24,724
It may feel really small,

309
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:27,543
but I promise you it makes a difference.

310
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,117
Nothing will ever bring back
Deah, Yusor and Razan.

311
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:36,070
But when we raise our collective voices,

312
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:37,809
that is when we stop the hate.

313
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,512
Thank you.

314
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:47,833
(Applause)
