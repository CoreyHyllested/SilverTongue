0
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:14,792
It's funny the things you forget.

1
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,499
I went to see my mother the other day,
and she told me this story

2
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,691
that I'd completely
forgotten about

3
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,101
how, when we were driving together,
she would pull the car over,

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,281
and by the time she had
gotten out of the car,

5
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,749
and gone around the car
to let me out of the car,

6
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,851
I would have already gotten out of the car

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,114
and pretended to have died.

8
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:37,084
(Laughter)

9
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:41,456
(Applause)

10
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:48,903
Because that's how you die.

11
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,860
(Laughter)

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,987
And I remember, that was a game
I used to play with myself

13
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:57,407
to entertain myself whenever
I was bored or frustrated.

14
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:59,570
(Laughter)

15
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:01,516
Settle down.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,533
(Laughter)

17
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,817
People say we live in an age
of information overload. Right?

18
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,005
I don't know about that,

19
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:10,592
but I just know that I get
too many marketing emails.

20
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:13,065
I got a marketing email
from a supermarket firm,

21
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,898
which will remain nameless

22
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,868
for predominantly legal reasons,

23
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:19,373
but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."

24
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:21,455
(Laughter)

25
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,677
I got an email from them,
and it went like this, it said:

26
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,942
"Just three weeks until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

27
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,378
And I resented this,

28
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:34,573
because not only do I not remember
signing up to that,

29
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:37,309
but I resent the fact
that they appear to think

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,475
that I should be excited
about a shop opening.

31
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,244
So what I did was I scrolled down
to the bottom of the email,

32
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:45,825
and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."

33
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,071
And I thought that'd be the end of it.

34
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:50,251
But a week later,
I got another one that said,

35
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,713
"Just two weeks

36
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,579
until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

37
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:57,230
And I thought, obviously,
I haven't clicked hard enough.

38
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,143
So I tried it again. Right?

39
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,739
Lo and behold, a week passes,
you guessed it,

40
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:06,820
"Just one week until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

41
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:08,686
And here's the problem:

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,032
The internet gave us access to everything;

43
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:14,193
but it also gave everything access to us.

44
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,750
It's hard enough to discriminate

45
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:19,329
between the things that genuinely
matter in this world

46
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:20,877
and the minutiae of life,

47
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,576
without having emails
about supermarket chains

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,043
and Candy Crush Saga.

49
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,403
And I was really annoyed with them,

50
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:31,605
and I thought, OK, I was about to write
a strongly worded email,

51
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,890
which I can do quite well.

52
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,707
(Laughter)

53
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:36,366
And I thought, no --

54
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:38,948
I'm going to find the game.

55
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,081
So I replied to it, and I said,

56
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,905
"I literally cannot wait!!!!"

57
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,455
(Laughter)

58
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,693
"What do you need from me?"

59
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,211
They got back to me;
a guy called Dan said,

60
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:56,149
"Hi James. I've asked a colleague
to help me with your query."

61
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,193
(Laughter)

62
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:58,849
Like it needs help.

63
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,119
And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?

64
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:04,436
I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,655
(Laughter)

66
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:09,751
"I'm not sure what you mean."

67
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,982
(Laughter)

68
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,309
I said, "I'm just tremendously
excited about the opening!"

69
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,768
(Laughter)

70
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,891
"Do you want to book
the bouncy castle or shall I?"

71
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,839
He said, "I think you have misunderstood."

72
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:27,378
(Laughter)

73
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:30,393
"A new store is opening,
but there is no celebration planned."

74
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,579
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks
until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?

75
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:37,742
I was getting excited."

76
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,249
(Laughter)

77
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,850
"I'm sorry you're disappointed."

78
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:43,874
(Laughter)

79
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,029
I said, "Not to worry.

80
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,989
Let's do something anyway!

81
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,369
Besides, the deposit on the bouncy
castle was non-refundable."

82
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,497
(Laughter)

83
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,632
"If we don't use it, we're out
a few hundred quid, Dan."

84
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,346
(Laughter)

85
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:08,249
He said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible
for anything you have ordered."

86
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:12,778
I said, "Let's not get into who did what.

87
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:16,811
Bottom line: you and I
are in this together."

88
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:19,079
(Laughter)

89
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,733
(Applause)

90
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,830
"Question: Will you be there
to make sure people take their shoes off?"

91
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,980
(Laughter)

92
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:34,875
I'll be honest, then my relationship
with Dan deteriorated somewhat,

93
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,224
because the next email I got was this:

94
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:39,630
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

95
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,654
(Laughter)

96
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,132
That's outrageous.

97
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,307
I said, "Dan?"

98
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,171
(Laughter)

99
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,117
And I got -- and I was just like,
this is ... -- and I, I ....

100
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,937
And I said, "Danny?"

101
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:56,023
And I thought, this is terrible.
All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.

102
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,594
I said, "D-Dog?"

103
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,444
(Laughter)

104
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,326
"The store is now open."

105
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,350
(Laughter)

106
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,618
I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered
why there was no bouncy castle."

107
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,896
And then we were back to this.

108
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,730
And that might have been
the end of the story,

109
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,806
but I remembered
that anything -- everything --

110
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,402
even something as mundane
as getting out of a car,

111
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,352
can be fun if you find the right game.

112
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:30,626
So,

113
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:33,253
this is what I replied:

114
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,670
[Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is #0000001.]

115
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,980
(Laughter)

116
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,339
(Applause)

117
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,238
And we just, uh ...

118
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,263
(Laughter)

119
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,440
It was like we were dancing.

120
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:52,707
It was just a beautiful relationship.

121
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,126
We just kept going.

122
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,592
It was lovely.

123
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:59,501
But to be honest, guys,
it was quite labor-intensive,

124
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,570
and I had other stuff to do,

125
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:03,983
believe it or not.

126
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:10,991
So what I did is I have a little email
auto-replier program.

127
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:15,493
And I set it up so every time
it receives an email from SafeMart,

128
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:16,667
it just pings one back.

129
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,042
So I set it up, and it says,

130
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,427
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

131
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:24,305
Then it has a little formula that I wrote
to up the case number every time.

132
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,614
And I put it on the server

133
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,820
and set it running.

134
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,446
(Laughter)

135
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,075
I'll be honest, guys --

136
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,495
then I forgot about it.

137
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,519
(Laughter)

138
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,592
I checked back on it the other day,

139
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:48,899
and it appears there have been
a number of emails going back and forth.

140
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,646
We're on 21,439.

141
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,852
(Applause)

142
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,304
It gives me an immense
sense of satisfaction to know

143
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:06,249
that these computer programs
are just going to be pinging one another

144
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:07,742
for eternity.

145
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,271
And as legacies go,
I don't think that's bad.

146
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:15,383
So guys, just remember:

147
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:18,860
if ever you feel weighed down
by the bureaucracy

148
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:21,025
and often mundanity of modern life,

149
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:23,898
don't fight the frustration.

150
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,763
Let it be the catalyst

151
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:29,890
for whimsy.

152
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,254
(Laughter)

153
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,437
Thank you.

154
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,293
(Applause)
