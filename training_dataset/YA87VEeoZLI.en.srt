00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:16,268
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.

1
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,101
They're exactly what they sound like.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,654
They are these huge collections of galaxies,

3
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,909
bound together by their mutual gravity.

4
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:25,571
So most of the points that you see on the screen

5
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:28,100
are not individual stars,

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,936
but collections of stars, or galaxies.

7
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:33,267
Now, by showing you some of these images,

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,014
I hope that you will quickly see that

9
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:37,694
galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,

10
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:39,187
but more than that,

11
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,850
I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,403
they are surprising,

13
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:44,820
and they're useful.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,351
Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.

15
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,987
And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters

16
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:53,852
is to describe the experiments

17
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:55,405
that you can do with them.

18
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,685
And I think there are four major types,

19
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,269
and the first type that I want to describe

20
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,488
is probing the very big.

21
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:04,183
So, how big?

22
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:08,434
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.

23
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,403
It is so massive that the light passing through it

24
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:14,018
is being bent, it's being distorted

25
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:16,527
by the extreme gravity of this cluster.

26
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:18,331
And, in fact, if you look very carefully

27
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:21,031
you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.

28
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,580
Now, to give you a number,

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,363
this particular galaxy cluster

30
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:28,571
has a mass of over one million billion suns.

31
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,884
It's just mind-boggling how
massive these systems can get.

32
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,385
But more than their mass,

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,359
they have this additional feature.

34
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,703
They are essentially isolated systems,

35
00:01:37,703 --> 00:01:39,925
so if we like, we can think of them

36
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:43,195
as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.

37
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,197
And many of the questions that we might have

38
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:47,165
about the universe at large scales,

39
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,080
such as, how does gravity work?

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,112
might be answered by studying these systems.

41
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,445
So that was very big.

42
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,330
The second things is very hot.

43
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,113
Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,

44
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:01,030
and I subtract away all of the starlight,

45
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,825
what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.

46
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,310
This is in false color.

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,659
It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.

48
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,320
And the question is, if it's not galaxies,

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,519
what is emitting this light?

50
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,419
The answer is hot gas,

51
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,242
million-degree gas --

52
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,899
in fact, it's plasma.

53
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,558
And the reason why it's so hot

54
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,538
goes back to the previous slide.

55
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:24,278
The extreme gravity of these systems

56
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,320
is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,902
and great speeds means great temperatures.

58
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,621
So this is the main idea,

59
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,987
but science is a rough draft.

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,538
There are many basic properties about this plasma

61
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,236
that still confuse us,

62
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:39,569
still puzzle us,

63
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,655
and still push our understanding

64
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:43,694
of the physics of the very hot.

65
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:47,121
Third thing: probing the very small.

66
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:49,967
Now, to explain this, I need to tell you

67
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,987
a very disturbing fact.

68
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,777
Most of the universe's matter

69
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:56,588
is not made up of atoms.

70
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,538
You were lied to.

71
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,665
Most of it is made up of something
very, very mysterious,

72
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,787
which we call dark matter.

73
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:07,454
Dark matter is something that
doesn't like to interact very much,

74
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,122
except through gravity,

75
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,734
and of course we would like to learn more about it.

76
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,277
If you're a particle physicist,

77
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,786
you want to know what happens
when we smash things together.

78
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:16,776
And dark matter is no exception.

79
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,436
Well, how do we do this?

80
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:19,927
To answer that question,

81
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm going to have to ask another one,

82
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,486
which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?

83
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,796
Here is an image.

84
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,987
Since galaxy clusters are representative

85
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:33,111
slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.

86
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:35,234
They are mostly made up of dark matter,

87
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,787
and that's what you see in this bluish purple.

88
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:39,404
The red represents the hot gas,

89
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:41,371
and, of course, you can see many galaxies.

90
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,736
What's happened is a particle accelerator

91
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:45,627
at a huge, huge scale.

92
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,404
And this is very important,

93
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,287
because what it means is that very, very small

94
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:52,371
effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,

95
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,550
might be compounded and compounded

96
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,359
into something that we could
possibly observe in nature.

97
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,871
So, it's very funny.

98
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:01,819
The reason why galaxy clusters

99
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,485
can teach us about dark matter,

100
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,235
the reason why galaxy clusters

101
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,788
can teach us about the physics of the very small,

102
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,819
is precisely because they are so very big.

103
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,904
Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.

104
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,954
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.

105
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,237
Okay, if there's anything stranger

106
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,654
I think it has to be dark energy.

107
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,371
If I throw a ball into the air,

108
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,169
I expect it to go up.

109
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,293
What I don't expect is that it go up

110
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:30,459
at an ever-increasing rate.

111
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,204
Similarly, cosmologists understand why

112
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,786
the universe is expanding.

113
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,954
They don't understand why it's expanding

114
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,892
at an ever-increasing rate.

115
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,570
They give the cause of this

116
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,162
accelerated expansion a name,

117
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,046
and they call it dark energy.

118
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:46,734
And, again, we want to learn more about it.

119
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:49,121
So, one particular question that we have is,

120
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,816
how does dark energy affect the universe

121
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,434
at the largest scales?

122
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,893
Depending on how strong it is,

123
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,154
maybe structure forms faster or slower.

124
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:00,703
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure

125
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,041
of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.

126
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,370
Here is a computer simulation.

127
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,498
And we need a way to simplify it.

128
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:11,069
Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.

129
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,787
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,

130
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:15,453
the most important thing to do

131
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,234
is not to model the little positions

132
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,155
of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.

133
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,820
The most important thing to do is

134
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,821
to track the two biggest parts.

135
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:27,653
Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe

136
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,120
at the largest scales

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,871
by tracking its biggest pieces

138
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:34,862
and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.

139
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:37,818
So, as I come to a close,

140
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:39,820
you might feel slightly cheated.

141
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,070
I mean, I began by talking about

142
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,153
how galaxy clusters are useful,

143
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,653
and I've given some reasons,

144
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:48,253
but what is their use really?

145
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:50,370
Well, to answer this,

146
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,986
I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford

147
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,472
when he was asked about cars.

148
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:55,831
He had this to say:

149
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,120
"If I had asked people what they wanted,

150
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,903
they would have said faster horses."

151
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,404
Today, we as a society are faced

152
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,622
with many, many difficult problems.

153
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:09,453
And the solutions to these
problems are not obvious.

154
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,620
They are not faster horses.

155
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,862
They will require an enormous amount of

156
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:15,568
scientific ingenuity.

157
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,154
So, yes, we need to focus,

158
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,904
yes, we need to concentrate,

159
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:20,870
but we also need to remember that

160
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,705
innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --

161
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,037
these things come

162
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:26,725
when we broaden our field of vision

163
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,065
when we step back

164
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,414
when we zoom out.

165
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,237
And I can't think of a better way to do this than

166
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:34,992
by studying the universe around us. Thanks.

167
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,941
(Applause)
