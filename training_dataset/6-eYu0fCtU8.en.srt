0
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,096
I'm a painter.

1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,696
I make large-scale figurative paintings,

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,120
which means I paint people

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,039
like this.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,616
But I'm here tonight to tell you
about something personal

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,320
that changed my work and my perspective.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,216
It's something we all go through,

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,840
and my hope is that my experience
may be helpful to somebody.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,096
To give you some background on me,
I grew up the youngest of eight.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,296
Yes, eight kids in my family.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,656
I have six older brothers and a sister.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
To give you a sense of what that's like,

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,736
when my family went on vacation,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,456
we had a bus.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,680
(Laughter)

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,656
My supermom would drive us all over town

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,416
to our various after-school activities --

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,640
not in the bus.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,640
We had a regular car, too.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,736
She would take me to art classes,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,016
and not just one or two.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,616
She took me to every available art class
from when I was eight to 16,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,280
because that's all I wanted to do.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,400
She even took a class with me
in New York City.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,736
Now, being the youngest of eight,
I learned a few survival skills.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,296
Rule number one:

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,280
don't let your big brother
see you do anything stupid.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,096
So I learned to be quiet and neat

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,760
and careful to follow the rules
and stay in line.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,616
But painting was where I made the rules.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,280
That was my private world.

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,440
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,200
My big plan was to be a waitress
to support my painting.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,296
So I continued honing my skills.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,456
I went to graduate school
and I got an MFA,

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,776
and at my first solo show,
my brother asked me,

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,776
"What do all these red dots
mean next to the paintings?"

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Nobody was more surprised than me.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,016
The red dots meant
that the paintings were sold

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,136
and that I'd be able to pay my rent

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,480
with painting.

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,376
Now, my apartment
had four electrical outlets,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,696
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,960
but still, I could pay my rent.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,680
So I was very happy.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,120
Here's a painting
from back around that time.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,536
I needed it to be
as realistic as possible.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
It had to be specific and believable.

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,720
This was the place where I was
isolated and in total control.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,376
Since then, I've made a career
of painting people in water.

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,416
Bathtubs and showers were
the perfect enclosed environment.

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,176
It was intimate and private,

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,416
and water was this complicated challenge
that kept me busy for a decade.

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,976
I made about 200 of these paintings,

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,720
some of them six to eight feet,

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
like this one.

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,736
For this painting, I mixed flour in
with the bathwater to make it cloudy

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,736
and I floated cooking oil on the surface

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,096
and stuck a girl in it,

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,736
and when I lit it up,

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,520
it was so beautiful
I couldn't wait to paint it.

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
I was driven by this
kind of impulsive curiosity,

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,496
always looking for something new to add:

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,480
vinyl, steam, glass.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,776
I once put all this Vaseline
in my head and hair

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
just to see what that would look like.

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,416
Don't do that.

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,880
(Laughter)

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,816
So it was going well.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
I was finding my way.

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,776
I was eager and motivated

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
and surrounded by artists,

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,800
always going to openings and events.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,216
I was having some success and recognition

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,600
and I moved into an apartment
with more than four outlets.

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,136
My mom and I would stay up very late

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,296
talking about our latest ideas
and inspiring each other.

77
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
She made beautiful pottery.

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,416
I have a friend named Bo
who made this painting

79
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,816
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,507
and he called it "The Light Years."

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,576
I asked him what that meant, and he said,

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,160
"Well, that's when you've stepped
into adulthood, you're no longer a child,

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,320
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
That was it. It was the light years.

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,536
On October 8, 2011,

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,616
the light years came to an end.

87
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,520
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,610
It had spread to her bones,
and it was in her brain.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,935
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.

90
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,200
I totally lost it.

91
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,136
And when I got myself together
and I looked at her,

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,736
I realized, this isn't about me.

93
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,800
This is about figuring out
how to help her.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,416
My father is a doctor,

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,016
and so we had a great advantage
having him in charge,

96
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,200
and he did a beautiful job
taking care of her.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,496
But I, too, wanted to do
everything I could to help,

98
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,096
so I wanted to try everything.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
We all did.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,656
I researched alternative medicines,

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,760
diets, juicing, acupuncture.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,976
Finally, I asked her,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
"Is this what you want me to do?"

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,520
And she said, "No."

105
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,480
She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later."

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,896
She knew what was happening,

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,336
and she knew what the doctors

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,856
and the experts
and the internet didn't know:

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,840
how she wanted to go through this.

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,840
I just needed to ask her.

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,936
I realized that if I tried to fix it,

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,160
I would miss it.

113
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,056
So I just started to be with her,

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,480
whatever that meant
and whatever situation came up,

115
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
just really listen to her.

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,360
If before I was resisting,
then now I was surrendering,

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,816
giving up trying to control
the uncontrollable

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
and just being there in it with her.

119
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Time slowed down,

120
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
and the date was irrelevant.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
We developed a routine.

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,760
Early each morning I would crawl
into bed with her and sleep with her.

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,856
My brother would come for breakfast

124
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,656
and we'd be so glad to hear
his car coming up the driveway.

125
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,440
So I'd help her up and take both her hands

126
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
and help her walk to the kitchen.

127
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,216
She had this huge mug she made

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
she loved to drink her coffee out of,

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
and she loved Irish soda bread
for breakfast.

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,976
Afterwards was the shower,

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,256
and she loved this part.

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,816
She loved the warm water,

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,296
so I made this as indulgent as I could,

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
like a spa.

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,096
My sister would help sometimes.

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,416
We had warm towels

137
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,576
and slippers ready immediately

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,560
so she never got cold for a second.

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
I'd blow-dry her hair.

140
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,056
My brothers would come in the evenings
and bring their kids,

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,920
and that was the highlight of her day.

142
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,400
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,776
and she didn't want to eat so much,

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,960
and she used the tiniest little teacup
we could find to drink her coffee.

145
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,976
I couldn't support her myself anymore,

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,280
so we hired an aide
to help me with the showers.

147
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,056
These simple daily activities

148
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
became our sacred ritual,

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,736
and we repeated them day after day

150
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
as the cancer grew.

151
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,696
It was humbling and painful

152
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
and exactly where I wanted to be.

153
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,440
We called this time "the beautiful awful."

154
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,976
She died on October 26, 2012.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
It was a year and three weeks
after her diagnosis.

156
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
She was gone.

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,496
My brothers, sister, and father and I

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
all came together in this
supportive and attentive way.

159
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,856
It was as though our whole family dynamic

160
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,936
and all our established roles vanished

161
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,616
and we were just
all together in this unknown,

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,496
feeling the same thing

163
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,000
and taking care of each other.

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm so grateful for them.

165
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,776
As someone who spends most
of my time alone in a studio working,

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,656
I had no idea that this kind of connection

167
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,616
could be so important, so healing.

168
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
This was the most important thing.

169
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
It was what I always wanted.

170
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,920
So after the funeral, it was time
for me to go back to my studio.

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,416
So I packed up my car
and I drove back to Brooklyn,

172
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,360
and painting is what I've always done,
so that's what I did.

173
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
And here's what happened.

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,480
It's like a release of everything
that was unraveling in me.

175
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,895
That safe, very, very carefully
rendered safe place

176
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,856
that I created in all my other paintings,

177
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,135
it was a myth.

178
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,360
It didn't work.

179
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,080
And I was afraid, because
I didn't want to paint anymore.

180
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,576
So I went into the woods.

181
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,216
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.

182
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,056
I got my paints,
and I wasn't a landscape painter,

183
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,696
but I wasn't really
much of any kind of painter at all,

184
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,216
so I had no attachment, no expectation,

185
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,296
which allowed me to be reckless and free.

186
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,376
I actually left one of these wet paintings

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,320
outside overnight

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,176
next to a light in the woods.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,160
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.

190
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,136
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.

191
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,536
I took all these paintings
back to my studio,

192
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,216
and scraped them, and carved into them,

193
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,736
and poured paint thinner on them,

194
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,056
put more paint on top, drew on them.

195
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,280
I had no plan,

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,130
but I was watching what was happening.

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,585
This is the one with all the bugs in it.

198
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,096
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.

199
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,576
It was the chaos and the imperfections
that were fascinating me,

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,280
and something started to happen.

201
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,160
I got curious again.

202
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,520
This is another one from the woods.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,136
There was a caveat now, though.

204
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,096
I couldn't be controlling
the paint like I used to.

205
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,136
It had to be about implying
and suggesting,

206
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
not explaining or describing.

207
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,016
And that imperfect,
chaotic, turbulent surface

208
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,840
is what told the story.

209
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
I started to be as curious
as I was when I was a student.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,096
So the next thing was I wanted
to put figures in these paintings, people,

211
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,896
and I loved this new environment,

212
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,200
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.

213
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,896
When the idea hit me of how to do this,

214
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,696
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,

215
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,576
which is really just adrenaline, probably,

216
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,536
but for me it's a really good sign.

217
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,696
And so now I want to show you
what I've been working on.

218
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,776
It's something I haven't shown yet,
and it's like a preview, I guess,

219
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,056
of my upcoming show,

220
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,280
what I have so far.

221
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,960
Expansive space

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
instead of the isolated bathtub.

223
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,640
I'm going outside instead of inside.

224
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,680
Loosening control,

225
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,896
savoring the imperfections,

226
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
allowing the --

227
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,840
allowing the imperfections.

228
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,336
And in that imperfection,

229
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,256
you can find a vulnerability.

230
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,440
I could feel my deepest intention,
what matters most to me,

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
that human connection

232
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,320
that can happen in a space
where there's no resisting or controlling.

233
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,275
I want to make paintings about that.

234
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,560
So here's what I learned.

235
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,240
We're all going to have
big losses in our lives,

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,056
maybe a job or a career,

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,360
relationships, love, our youth.

238
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,736
We're going to lose our health,

239
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
people we love.

240
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,656
These kinds of losses
are out of our control.

241
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,880
They're unpredictable,

242
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
and they bring us to our knees.

243
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
And so I say, let them.

244
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,400
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.

245
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,640
Let go of trying to change it

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
or even wanting it to be different.

247
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
It just is.

248
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,616
And then there's space,

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,816
and in that space feel your vulnerability,

250
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,536
what matters most to you,

251
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,240
your deepest intention.

252
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
And be curious to connect

253
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
to what and who is really here,

254
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,240
awake and alive.

255
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,480
It's what we all want.

256
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
Let's take the opportunity
to find something beautiful

257
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
in the unknown, in the unpredictable,

258
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
and even in the awful.

259
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,536
Thank you.

260
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,639
(Applause)
