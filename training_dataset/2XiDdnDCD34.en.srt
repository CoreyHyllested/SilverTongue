0
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ten years ago exactly,

1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was in Afghanistan.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I was covering the war in Afghanistan,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the amount of suffering and destruction

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that emerged out of a war like that.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then, two years later,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was placed at the center of that war

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because I was covering the war

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
from the northern part of Iraq.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the war ended

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with a regime change,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
like the one in Afghanistan.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that regime

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that we got rid of

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
was actually a dictatorship,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
an authoritarian regime,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that for decades

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
created a great sense of paralysis

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
within the nation, within the people themselves.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
However,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the change that came through foreign intervention

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
created even worse circumstances for the people

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and deepened the sense

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of paralysis and inferiority

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in that part of the world.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
For decades,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we have lived under authoritarian regimes --

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
in the Arab world, in the Middle East.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
These regimes

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
created something within us during this period.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm 43 years old right now.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For the last 40 years,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have seen almost the same faces

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
for kings and presidents ruling us --

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
old, aged, authoritarian,

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
corrupt situations --

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
regimes that we have seen around us.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And for a moment I was wondering,

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
are we going to live in order to see

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
real change happening on the ground,

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
a change that does not come through foreign intervention,

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
through the misery of occupation,

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
through nations invading our land

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but when they saw

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
their land occupied by foreign forces

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
they felt very sad,

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
they felt that their dignity had suffered.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And this is why they revolted.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is why they did not accept.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Would you like to see destruction?

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And the people thought for themselves,

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
"Maybe we should live with

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
instead of having the second scenario."

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For 10 years,

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
unfortunately we have found ourselves

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
reporting images of destruction,

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
images of killing,

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of sectarian conflicts,

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
images of violence,

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
emerging from a magnificent piece of land,

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
a region that one day was the source

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
of civilizations and art and culture

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
for thousands of years.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now I am here to tell you

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that the future

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that we were dreaming for

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
has eventually arrived.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
A new generation,

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
well-educated,

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
connected,

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
inspired by universal values

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and a global understanding,

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
has created a new reality for us.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We have found a new way

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to express our feelings

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and to express our dreams:

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
these young people

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
who have restored self-confidence

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
in our nations in that part of the world,

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
who have given us

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
new meaning for freedom

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and empowered us to go down to the streets.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Just step out of your house,

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
raise your voice

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is what happened in Tunisia.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Over a few days,

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in the security agencies,

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
billions of dollars

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
in maintaining, trying to maintain,

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
its prisons,

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
collapsed, disappeared,

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
because of the voices of the public.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
People who were inspired to go down to the streets

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and to raise their voices,

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
they tried to kill.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They found something called Facebook.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They found something called Twitter.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And they said,

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
"These kids are misled."

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Therefore, they asked their parents

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
to go down to the streets

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and collect them, bring them back home.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
"Bring these kids home

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
because they are misled."

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But yes,

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
these youth

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
who have been inspired

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
by universal values,

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
who are idealistic enough

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to imagine a magnificent future

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and, at the same time, realistic enough

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
to balance this kind of imagination

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and the process leading to it --

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
not using violence,

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
not trying to create chaos --

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
these young people,

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
they did not go home.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Parents actually went to the streets

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and they supported them.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We in Al Jazeera

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
were banned from Tunisia for years,

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the government did not allow

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But we found that these people in the street,

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
all of them are our reporters,

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
feeding our newsroom

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
with pictures, with videos

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and with news.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
became a center

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
people who are connected and people who have ambition

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and who have liberated themselves

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
from the feeling of inferiority.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then we took that decision:

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We are unrolling the news.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We are going to spread the message.

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, some of these young people

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
are connected to the Internet,

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but the connectivity in the Arab world

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is very little, is very small,

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because of many problems that we are suffering from.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and we amplified [it].

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and internationally, globally,

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
through our English channel.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then people started to feel

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that there's something new happening.

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
decided to leave.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then Egypt started,

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And now Libya as you see it.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then you have Yemen.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And you have many other countries trying to see

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and to rediscover that feeling

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
of, "How do we imagine a future

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I want to tell you something,

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that the Internet and connectivity

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
has created [a] new mindset.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But this mindset

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
has continued to be faithful

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to the soil and to the land

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that it emerged from.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And while this was the major difference

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
between many initiatives before

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to create change,

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
before we thought, and governments told us --

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and even sometimes it was true --

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that change was imposed on us,

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and people rejected that,

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because they thought that it is alien to their culture.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Always, we believed

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that change will spring from within,

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
that change should be a reconciliation

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
with culture, cultural diversity,

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
with our faith in our tradition

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and in our history,

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but at the same time,

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
open to universal values, connected with the world,

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
tolerant to the outside.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And this is the moment

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
that is happening right now in the Arab world.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that we see all of these meanings meet together

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and then create the beginning

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
of this magnificent era

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that will emerge from the region.

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How did the elite deal with that --

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the so-called political elite?

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In front of Facebook,

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In front of Al Jazeera,

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
they started creating tribalism.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then when they failed,

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
they started speaking about conspiracies

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
in order to divide the Arab world.

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They started telling the West,

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
These are Islamists

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
trying to create new Imaras.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Be aware of these people

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
who [are] coming to you

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
in order to ruin your great civilization."

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Fortunately,

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
people right now cannot be deceived.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because this corrupt elite

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
in that region

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
has lost even the power of deception.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They could not, and they cannot, imagine

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
how they could really deal with this reality.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They have lost.

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They have been detached

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
from their people, from the masses,

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and now we are seeing them collapsing

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
one after the other.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Al Jazeera is not

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a tool of revolution.

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We do not create revolutions.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
However,

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
when something of that magnitude happens,

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we are at the center of the coverage.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We were banned from Egypt,

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and our correspondents,

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
some of them were arrested.

247
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But most of our camera people

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and our journalists,

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to report what happened in Tahrir Square.

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
For 18 days,

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
our cameras were broadcasting, live,

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I remember one night

255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
when someone phoned me on my cellphone --

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He told me, "We appeal to you

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
not to switch off the cameras.

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you switch off the cameras tonight,

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
there will be a genocide.

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are protecting us

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I felt the responsibility

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to phone our correspondents there

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and to phone our newsroom

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and to tell them, "Make your best

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
not to switch off the cameras at night,

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
because the guys there really feel confident

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
when someone is reporting their story --

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and they feel protected as well."

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So we have a chance

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to create a new future

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in that part of the world.

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We have a chance

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
to go and to think of the future

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
as something which is open to the world.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
from thinking about that part of the world

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
based on oil interest,

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
or based on interests

283
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of the illusion of stability and security.

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The stability and security

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
of authoritarian regimes

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
cannot create

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but terrorism and violence and destruction.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let us accept the choice of the people.

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let us not pick and choose

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
who we would like to rule their future.

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The future should be ruled

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
by people themselves,

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
even sometimes if they are voices

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that might now scare us.

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But the values of democracy

296
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and the freedom of choice

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
is the best opportunity for the world,

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
for the West and the East,

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to see stability and to see security

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and to see friendship and to see tolerance

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
emerging from the Arab world,

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
rather than the images of violence and terrorism.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let us support these people.

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let us stand for them.

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And let us give up

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
our narrow selfishness

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
in order to embrace change,

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and in order to celebrate with the people of that region

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
a great future

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and hope and tolerance.

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The future has arrived,

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and the future is now.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I thank you very much.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:29,000
(Applause)

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you very much.

317
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
(Applause)

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you for coming here.

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
How would you characterize the historical significance

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
of what's happened?

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
or something more?

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We have covered many wars.

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,

327
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
because we were centered at the middle of it.

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It is not something that you only cover

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
because you have to cover a great incident.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You are witnessing change in history.

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are witnessing the birth of a new era.

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And this is what the story's all about.

335
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
CA: There are a lot of people in the West

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
who are still skeptical,

337
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
or think this may just be an intermediate stage

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
before much more alarming chaos.

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You really believe

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that a government could emerge

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
WK: And people actually,

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the youth who have organized themselves

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in certain groups and councils,

347
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
they are guarding the transformation

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and they are trying to put it on a track

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in order to satisfy

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the values of democracy,

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but at the same time

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
also to make it reasonable

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and to make it rational,

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
not to go out of order.

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In my opinion, these people are much more wiser

356
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
than, not only the political elite,

357
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
including political parties.

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
are much more wiser

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and capable of creating the change

362
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
than the old --

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
including the political and cultural

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and ideological

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
old regimes.

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
(Applause)

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What should people here at TED,

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
here in the West,

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
do if they want to connect or make a difference

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and they believe in what's happening here?

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that people care,

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
people care about this great transformation.

375
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,

376
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the head of Aljazeera.net,

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
he told me that a 2,500 percent increase

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
of accessing our website

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
from various parts of the world.

380
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Fifty percent of it is coming from America.

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because we discovered that people care,

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and people would like to know --

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
they are receiving the stream through our Internet.

384
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Unfortunately in the United States,

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
for Al Jazeera English.

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
through connecting ourselves

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
with those people in the street

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and expressing our support to them

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
of supporting the weak and the oppressed

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to create a much better future for all of us.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,

395
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
TEDxCairo,

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
are meeting as we speak.

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They've had some speakers there.

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I believe they've heard your talk.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you so much.

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
(Applause)
