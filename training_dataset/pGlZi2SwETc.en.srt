0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,120
Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,130
and you start talking, and after a while,
the question comes up,

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,000
"So, what do you do for work?"

4
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,950
And since you think
your job is interesting,

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,230
you say, "I'm a mathematician."
(Laughter)

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,080
And inevitably, during that conversation

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,750
one of these two phrases come up:

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,195
A) "I was terrible at math,
but it wasn't my fault.

9
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,613
It's because the teacher
was awful." (Laughter)

10
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:47,582
Or B) "But what is math really for?"

11
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:48,610
(Laughter)

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,955
I'll now address Case B.

13
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:52,510
(Laughter)

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,354
When someone asks you what math is for,
they're not asking you

15
00:00:57,354 --> 00:01:00,203
about applications
of mathematical science.

16
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,554
They're asking you,

17
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:05,485
why did I have to study that bullshit
I never used in my life again? (Laughter)

18
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,924
That's what they're actually asking.

19
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,124
So when mathematicians are asked
what math is for,

20
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:14,404
they tend to fall into two groups:

21
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:19,739
54,51 percent of mathematicians
will assume an attacking position,

22
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,559
and 44,77 percent of mathematicians
will take a defensive position.

23
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:29,068
There's a strange 0,8 percent,
among which I include myself.

24
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:31,155
Who are the ones that attack?

25
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,902
The attacking ones are mathematicians
who would tell you

26
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:35,849
this question makes no sense,

27
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:38,597
because mathematics
have a meaning all their own --

28
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:41,144
a beautiful edifice with its own logic --

29
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,011
and that there's no point

30
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,558
in constantly searching
for all possible applications.

31
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:47,847
What's the use of poetry?
What's the use of love?

32
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:50,908
What's the use of life itself?
What kind of question is that?

33
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,529
(Laughter)

34
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,296
Hardy, for instance, was a model
of this type of attack.

35
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:58,242
And those who stand in defense tell you,

36
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:03,082
"Even if you don't realize it, friend,
math is behind everything."

37
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,340
(Laughter)

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,218
Those guys,

39
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:10,246
they always bring up
bridges and computers.

40
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,841
"If you don't know math,
your bridge will collapse."

41
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,286
(Laughter)

42
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:17,523
It's true, computers are all about math.

43
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,008
And now these guys
have also started saying

44
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:25,050
that behind information security
and credit cards are prime numbers.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,379
These are the answers your math teacher
would give you if you asked him.

46
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,544
He's one of the defensive ones.

47
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,384
Okay, but who's right then?

48
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,990
Those who say that math
doesn't need to have a purpose,

49
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,849
or those who say that math
is behind everything we do?

50
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,520
Actually, both are right.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,183
But remember I told you

52
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:45,726
I belong to that strange 0,8 percent
claiming something else?

53
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:48,929
So, go ahead, ask me what math is for.

54
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,858
Audience: What is math for?

55
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:56,673
Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,
76,34 percent of you asked the question,

56
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:59,600
23,41 percent didn't say anything,

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,827
and the 0,8 percent --

58
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,675
I'm not sure what those guys are doing.

59
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:07,175
Well, to my dear 76,31 percent --

60
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:11,815
it's true that math doesn't need
to serve a purpose,

61
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:14,685
it's true that it's
a beautiful structure, a logical one,

62
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,537
probably one
of the greatest collective efforts

63
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,633
ever achieved in human history.

64
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,732
But it's also true that there,

65
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:26,331
where scientists and technicians
are looking for mathematical theories

66
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,641
that allow them to advance,

67
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,438
they're within the structure of math,
which permeates everything.

68
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,585
It's true that we have to go
somewhat deeper,

69
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,308
to see what's behind science.

70
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:40,858
Science operates on intuition, creativity.

71
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:44,772
Math controls intuition
and tames creativity.

72
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,937
Almost everyone
who hasn't heard this before

73
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,647
is surprised when they hear
that if you take

74
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,187
a 0,1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,
the size we normally use,

75
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:58,505
and, if it were big enough,
fold it 50 times,

76
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:04,205
its thickness would extend almost
the distance from the Earth to the sun.

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,201
Your intuition tells you it's impossible.

78
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,622
Do the math and you'll see it's right.

79
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:12,135
That's what math is for.

80
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,917
It's true that science, all types
of science, only makes sense

81
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:19,288
because it makes us better understand
this beautiful world we live in.

82
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,669
And in doing that,

83
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,179
it helps us avoid the pitfalls
of this painful world we live in.

84
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,657
There are sciences that help us
in this way quite directly.

85
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,413
Oncological science, for example.

86
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:32,904
And there are others we look at from afar,
with envy sometimes,

87
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,464
but knowing that we are
what supports them.

88
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:38,213
All the basic sciences
support them,

89
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:40,649
including math.

90
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,366
All that makes science, science
is the rigor of math.

91
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:49,242
And that rigor factors in
because its results are eternal.

92
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:51,757
You probably said or were told
at some point

93
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,708
that diamonds are forever, right?

94
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,392
That depends on
your definition of forever!

95
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,883
A theorem -- that really is forever.

96
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,134
(Laughter)

97
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,486
The Pythagorean theorem is still true

98
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:08,601
even though Pythagoras is dead,
I assure you it's true. (Laughter)

99
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,946
Even if the world collapsed

100
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,391
the Pythagorean theorem
would still be true.

101
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:16,452
Wherever any two triangle sides
and a good hypotenuse get together

102
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:17,673
(Laughter)

103
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,534
the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.
It works like crazy.

104
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:23,355
(Applause)

105
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,407
Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves
to come up with theorems.

106
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,143
Eternal truths.

107
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,909
But it isn't always easy to know
the difference between

108
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,815
an eternal truth, or theorem,
and a mere conjecture.

109
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,829
You need proof.

110
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,596
For example,

111
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:48,423
let's say I have a big,
enormous, infinite field.

112
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:52,132
I want to cover it with equal pieces,
without leaving any gaps.

113
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,256
I could use squares, right?

114
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:58,222
I could use triangles.
Not circles, those leave little gaps.

115
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:01,134
Which is the best shape to use?

116
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:05,687
One that covers the same surface,
but has a smaller border.

117
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:10,396
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria
said the best is to use hexagons,

118
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,243
just like bees do.

119
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,990
But he didn't prove it.

120
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,688
The guy said, "Hexagons, great!
Let's go with hexagons!"

121
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:19,656
He didn't prove it,
it remained a conjecture.

122
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,334
"Hexagons!"

123
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:24,964
And the world, as you know,
split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,

124
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:30,253
until 1700 years later

125
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:35,707
when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved

126
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:40,641
that Pappus and the bees were right --
the best shape to use was the hexagon.

127
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,123
And that became a theorem,
the honeycomb theorem,

128
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,183
that will be true forever and ever,

129
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,224
for longer than any diamond
you may have. (Laughter)

130
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:51,033
But what happens if we go
to three dimensions?

131
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,944
If I want to fill the space
with equal pieces,

132
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,805
without leaving any gaps,

133
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,638
I can use cubes, right?

134
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:01,994
Not spheres, those leave little gaps.
(Laughter)

135
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,957
What is the best shape to use?

136
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:09,017
Lord Kelvin, of the famous
Kelvin degrees and all,

137
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:15,121
said that the best was to use
a truncated octahedron

138
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,507
which, as you all know --

139
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,035
(Laughter) --

140
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,814
is this thing here!

141
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:25,753
(Applause)

142
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,225
Come on.

143
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,862
Who doesn't have a truncated
octahedron at home? (Laughter)

144
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,089
Even a plastic one.

145
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,846
"Honey, get the truncated octahedron,
we're having guests."

146
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,240
Everybody has one!
(Laughter)

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,614
But Kelvin didn't prove it.

148
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:44,655
It remained a conjecture --
Kelvin's conjecture.

149
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:50,177
The world, as you know, then split into
Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists

150
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,599
(Laughter)

151
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,496
until a hundred or so years later,

152
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:02,072
someone found a better structure.

153
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:08,026
Weaire and Phelan
found this little thing over here --

154
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,665
(Laughter) --

155
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:13,209
this structure to which they gave
the very clever name

156
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,375
"the Weaire-€“Phelan structure."

157
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,911
(Laughter)

158
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,568
It looks like a strange object,
but it isn't so strange,

159
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,239
it also exists in nature.

160
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,844
It's very interesting that this structure,

161
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:27,037
because of its geometric properties,

162
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:32,229
was used to build the Aquatics Center
for the Beijing Olympic Games.

163
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,714
There, Michael Phelps
won eight gold medals,

164
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,875
and became the best swimmer of all time.

165
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,616
Well, until someone better
comes along, right?

166
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:45,015
As may happen
with the Weaire-€“Phelan structure.

167
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,633
It's the best
until something better shows up.

168
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:52,225
But be careful, because this one
really stands a chance

169
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:57,205
that in a hundred or so years,
or even if it's in 1700 years,

170
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:02,603
that someone proves
it's the best possible shape for the job.

171
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:07,348
It will then become a theorem,
a truth, forever and ever.

172
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:10,302
For longer than any diamond.

173
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:14,567
So, if you want to tell someone

174
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,823
that you will love them forever

175
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,890
you can give them a diamond.

176
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,421
But if you want to tell them
that you'll love them forever and ever,

177
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,172
give them a theorem!

178
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,263
(Laughter)

179
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:29,853
But hang on a minute!

180
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,183
You'll have to prove it,

181
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,466
so your love doesn't remain

182
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,299
a conjecture.

183
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,543
(Applause)
