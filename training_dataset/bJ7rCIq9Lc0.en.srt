0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,601
Look, I had second thoughts, really,

2
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,636
about whether I could talk about this

3
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:19,676
to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.

4
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:22,266
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,

5
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,905
which goes,

6
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,836
"The truth will set you free,

7
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:29,795
but first it will piss you off." (Laughter)

8
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,063
So -- (Laughter)

9
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,187
So with that in mind, I'm going to set about

10
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:35,778
trying to do those things here,

11
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,640
and talk about dying in the 21st century.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,040
Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,659
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die

14
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,733
in the 21st century.

15
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,123
There will be no exceptions to that.

16
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:48,780
There are, apparently, about one in eight of you

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,304
who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --

18
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:53,482
(Laughter)

19
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:58,095
Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.

20
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,748
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,

21
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:03,244
a hundred million of my cells will die,

22
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,838
and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells

23
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,979
will die and never come back,

24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,060
so you could argue that the dying process

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,138
starts pretty early in the piece.

26
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,252
Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the

27
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:16,617
21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,

28
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:19,233
is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck

29
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,578
for most of us,

30
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,547
unless we do something to try and reclaim this process

31
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:28,264
from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.

32
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:30,072
So there you go. That's the truth.

33
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,503
No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see

34
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:34,479
whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,062
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,

36
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:40,166
and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday

37
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,173
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.

38
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,373
This has been fantastic.

39
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:44,528
We have machines that go ping.

40
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:46,838
There's many of them up there.

41
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:49,582
And we have some wizard technology which I think

42
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,094
has worked really well, and over the course of the time

43
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:54,166
I've worked in intensive care, the death rate

44
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,536
for males in Australia has halved,

45
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,155
and intensive care has had something to do with that.

46
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,163
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use

47
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,383
have got something to do with that.

48
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,887
So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of

49
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:07,241
got caught up in our own success quite a bit,

50
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,865
and we started using expressions like "lifesaving."

51
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,999
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,

52
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,229
because obviously, we don't.

53
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,757
What we do is prolong people's lives,

54
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,858
and delay death,

55
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,703
and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,

56
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,558
save lives on any sort of permanent basis.

57
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,543
And what's really happened over the period of time

58
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:29,182
that I've been working in intensive care is that

59
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,752
the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,

60
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,230
'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century

61
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,830
of diseases that we no longer have the answers to

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,340
in quite the way we did then.

63
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,215
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift

64
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,022
in the way that people die,

65
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,293
and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable

66
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:52,119
to what we can do as what it used to be like

67
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:56,030
when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.

68
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,894
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,

69
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:01,927
and we haven't really squared with you guys about

70
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,982
what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.

71
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:09,373
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s

72
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,467
when I met this guy.

73
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,824
This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.

74
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,127
I was called down to the ward to see him.

75
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:20,372
His is the little hand.

76
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,758
I was called down to the ward to see him

77
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:22,852
by a respiratory physician.

78
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,028
He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.

79
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,628
He's got pneumonia,

80
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:29,133
and he looks like he needs intensive care.

81
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,207
His daughter's here and she wants everything possible

82
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:33,738
to be done."

83
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:36,357
Which is a familiar phrase to us.

84
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,188
So I go down to the ward and see Jim,

85
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:39,873
and his skin his translucent like this.

86
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,123
You can see his bones through the skin.

87
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,661
He's very, very thin,

88
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:47,043
and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,

89
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,524
and he's too sick to talk to me,

90
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:53,674
so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,

91
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,638
"Did you and Jim ever talk about

92
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,321
what you would want done

93
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,335
if he ended up in this kind of situation?"

94
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:04,064
And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"

95
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:09,124
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady."

96
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,968
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,

97
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,971
"You know, we always thought there'd be time."

98
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:18,737
Jim was 94. (Laughter)

99
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:21,271
And I realized that something wasn't happening here.

100
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,595
There wasn't this dialogue going on

101
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,248
that I imagined was happening.

102
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:28,255
So a group of us started doing survey work,

103
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,475
and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home

104
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,815
residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,

105
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,762
and discovered that only one in a hundred of them

106
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:39,827
had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.

107
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:40,966
One in a hundred.

108
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,307
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do

109
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,404
if they became seriously ill.

110
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,164
And I realized, of course, this dialogue

111
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,800
is definitely not occurring in the public at large.

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,278
Now, I work in acute care.

113
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:58,383
This is John Hunter Hospital.

114
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:02,384
And I thought, surely, we do better than that.

115
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,380
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I

116
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,896
went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes

117
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,169
in the medical records department

118
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:11,790
looking at whether there was any sign at all

119
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,218
that anybody had had any conversation about

120
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:16,071
what might happen to them if the treatment they were

121
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,415
receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.

122
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,356
And we didn't find a single record of any preference

123
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,200
about goals, treatments or outcomes from any

124
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,770
of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.

125
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,487
So we started to realize

126
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:35,688
that we had a problem,

127
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:40,711
and the problem is more serious because of this.

128
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:44,013
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,

129
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,678
but how we die is actually really important,

130
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:50,233
obviously not just to us, but also to how that

131
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,367
features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.

132
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,688
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody

133
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,805
who survives us, and

134
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,537
the stress created in families by dying is enormous,

135
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,223
and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying

136
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:07,960
in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,

137
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,038
so dying in intensive care is not your top option

138
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,496
if you've got a choice.

139
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,665
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,

140
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,313
all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that

141
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,665
many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,

142
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,115
will die in intensive care.

143
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,449
In the U.S., it's one in five.

144
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,199
In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.

145
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,264
So this is the sort of momentum

146
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,552
that we've got at the moment.

147
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:34,097
The reason why this is all happening is due to this,

148
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,399
and I do have to take you through what this is about.

149
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,364
These are the four ways to go.

150
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,229
So one of these will happen to all of us.

151
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,759
The ones you may know most about are the ones

152
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,605
that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:

153
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,022
sudden death.

154
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,467
It's quite likely in an audience this size

155
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,018
this won't happen to anybody here.

156
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,748
Sudden death has become very rare.

157
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,203
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff

158
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,876
just doesn't happen anymore.

159
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,293
The dying process of those with terminal illness

160
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,325
that we've just seen

161
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,940
occurs to younger people.

162
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,790
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.

163
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,205
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.

164
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:13,040
The big growth industry are these.

165
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,291
What you die of is increasing organ failure,

166
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,526
with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,

167
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:20,306
whatever organs packing up. Each of these

168
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,909
would be an admission to an acute care hospital,

169
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,878
at the end of which, or at some point during which,

170
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,054
somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.

171
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,622
And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,

172
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:32,197
and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room

173
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,759
will die in this form, which is

174
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,653
the dwindling of capacity

175
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,972
with increasing frailty,

176
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,222
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,

177
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:45,775
and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing

178
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,824
that people die of now,

179
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,952
and the last few years, or the last year of your life

180
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:52,967
is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.

181
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:56,351
Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)

182
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,504
(Laughter)

183
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:02,932
Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.

184
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:08,090
(Laughter)

185
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,149
What can I say that's positive? What's positive is

186
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,564
that this is happening at very great age, now.

187
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:14,309
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.

188
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,197
You know, historically, we didn't do that.

189
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:17,666
This is what happens to you

190
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,189
when you live to be a great age,

191
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,078
and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean

192
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:24,005
more old age, not more youth.

193
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:30,098
I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)

194
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,895
What we did, anyway, look, what we did,

195
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,422
we didn't just take this lying down

196
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,924
at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.

197
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,546
We've started a whole series of projects

198
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:39,542
to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve

199
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:43,036
people much more in the way that things happen to them.

200
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,268
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing

201
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,612
with cultural issues,

202
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,471
and this is, I love this Klimt painting,

203
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,676
because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get

204
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,695
the whole issue that's going on here,

205
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:56,213
which is clearly the separation of death from the living,

206
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,093
and the fear — Like, if you actually look,

207
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,268
there's one woman there

208
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:01,187
who has her eyes open.

209
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:02,872
She's the one he's looking at,

210
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:06,100
and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,626
She looks terrified.

212
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,319
It's an amazing picture.

213
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:11,540
Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.

214
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,524
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,

215
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,019
or, we thought that.

216
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,966
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government

217
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,386
and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing

218
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:21,284
at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.

219
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:24,133
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards

220
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:27,276
and talk to people about the fact that they would die,

221
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,562
and what would they prefer under those circumstances.

222
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:33,081
They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.

223
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,541
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought

224
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,995
this just should have been normal practice,

225
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,378
and that this is how things should work.

226
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,316
And when they expressed wishes,

227
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:43,289
all of those wishes came true, as it were.

228
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,269
We were able to make that happen for them.

229
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,519
But then, when the funding ran out,

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,604
we went back to look six months later,

231
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,871
and everybody had stopped again,

232
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,064
and nobody was having these conversations anymore.

233
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,117
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,

234
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,834
because we thought this was going to really take off.

235
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,805
The cultural issue had reasserted itself.

236
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:04,960
So here's the pitch:

237
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,046
I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway

238
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:11,545
to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not

239
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,338
that's where we all want to end up,

240
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,474
particularly as we become older and increasingly frail

241
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:19,128
and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.

242
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,458
There has to be a little side road

243
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,933
off there for people who don't want to go on that track.

244
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,569
And I have one small idea,

245
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:33,018
and one big idea about what could happen.

246
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,079
And this is the small idea.

247
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,860
The small idea is, let's all of us

248
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,796
engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.

249
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,849
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations

250
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,170
with our own elders

251
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,960
and people who might be approaching this?

252
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,794
There are a couple of things you can do.

253
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,925
One of them is, you can,

254
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,839
just ask this simple question. This question never fails.

255
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,594
"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,

256
00:10:57,594 --> 00:11:00,527
who would you like to speak for you?"

257
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,441
That's a really important question to ask people,

258
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,464
because giving people the control over who that is

259
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,772
produces an amazing outcome.

260
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:08,918
The second thing you can say is,

261
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,416
"Have you spoken to that person

262
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,336
about the things that are important to you

263
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:16,490
so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"

264
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,012
So that's the little idea.

265
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,506
The big idea, I think, is more political.

266
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,457
I think we have to get onto this.

267
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:25,519
I suggested we should have Occupy Death.

268
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,304
(Laughter)

269
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,874
My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.

270
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,453
Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)

271
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,318
So that one didn't really run,

272
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,988
but I was very struck by this.

273
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,701
Now, I'm an aging hippie.

274
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,198
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but

275
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,698
I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s

276
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:47,166
when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers

277
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,862
are used to taking charge of the situation,

278
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:53,260
so if you just replace all these words of birth,

279
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,341
I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.

280
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,857
I do think we have to get political

281
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:00,455
and start to reclaim this process from

282
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,422
the medicalized model in which it's going.

283
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,462
Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.

284
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,654
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,

285
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,318
I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.

286
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,505
I don't think euthanasia matters.

287
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,656
I actually think that,

288
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,205
in places like Oregon,

289
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:19,677
where you can have physician-assisted suicide,

290
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,894
you take a poisonous dose of stuff,

291
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,770
only half a percent of people ever do that.

292
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,476
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99,5 percent

293
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,232
of people who don't want to do that.

294
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,566
I think most people don't want to be dead,

295
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,663
but I do think most people want to have some control

296
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:35,405
over how their dying process proceeds.

297
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,545
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,

298
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,198
but I do think we have to give people back some control.

299
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,671
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.

300
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,023
I think we should be looking at stopping

301
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,062
the want for euthanasia,

302
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:49,757
not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.

303
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,333
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,

304
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,702
whom I met when I was a medical student.

305
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:57,581
She founded the hospice movement.

306
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,772
And she said, "You matter because you are,

307
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:02,294
and you matter to the last moment of your life."

308
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:04,551
And I firmly believe that

309
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,637
that's the message that we have to carry forward.

310
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:10,656
Thank you. (Applause)
