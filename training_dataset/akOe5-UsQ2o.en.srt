0
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,520
I'd like to try something new.

1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,736
Those of you who are able,

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960
please stand up.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
OK, so I'm going to name some names.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,456
When you hear a name
that you don't recognize,

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,335
you can't tell me anything about them,

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,136
I'd like you to take a seat

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
and stay seated.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,856
The last person standing,
we're going to see what they know. OK?

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,456
(Laughter)

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,680
All right.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,360
Eric Garner.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,760
Mike Brown.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,520
Tamir Rice.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,960
Freddie Gray.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,136
So those of you who are still standing,

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,256
I'd like you to turn around
and take a look.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,280
I'd say half to most of the people
are still standing.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
So let's continue.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,000
Michelle Cusseaux.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,640
Tanisha Anderson.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
Aura Rosser.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Meagan Hockaday.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,216
So if we look around again,

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,256
there are about four people
still standing,

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,976
and actually I'm not going
to put you on the spot.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,576
I just say that to encourage transparency,
so you can be seated.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
(Laughter)

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,776
So those of you who recognized
the first group of names know

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,696
that these were African-Americans
who have been killed by the police

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,920
over the last two and a half years.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,416
What you may not know

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,856
is that the other list
is also African-Americans

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,680
who have been killed
within the last two years.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,656
Only one thing distinguishes
the names that you know

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
from the names that you don't know:

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
gender.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,536
So let me first let you know
that there's nothing at all distinct

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,336
about this audience

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,176
that explains the pattern of recognition
that we've just seen.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,696
I've done this exercise
dozens of times around the country.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,296
I've done it to women's
rights organizations.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,456
I've done it with civil rights groups.

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,456
I've done it with professors.
I've done it with students.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,736
I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,256
I've done it even with
progressive members of Congress.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,576
And everywhere, the awareness
of the level of police violence

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,496
that black women experience

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
is exceedingly low.

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,176
Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
that this would be the case.

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,216
I mean, there are two issues
involved here.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,336
There's police violence
against African-Americans,

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,416
and there's violence against women,

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,400
two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately.

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,096
But when we think about
who is implicated by these problems,

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,616
when we think about
who is victimized by these problems,

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,720
the names of these black women
never come to mind.

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,416
Now, communications experts tell us

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,896
that when facts do not fit
with the available frames,

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,656
people have a difficult time
incorporating new facts

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,960
into their way of thinking
about a problem.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,336
These women's names
have slipped through our consciousness

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,776
because there are no frames
for us to see them,

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,096
no frames for us to remember them,

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
no frames for us to hold them.

65
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,840
As a consequence,

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,440
reporters don't lead with them,

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,376
policymakers don't think about them,

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,800
and politicians aren't encouraged
or demanded that they speak to them.

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,416
Now, you might ask,

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,016
why does a frame matter?

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,856
I mean, after all,

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,176
an issue that affects black people
and an issue that affects women,

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,256
wouldn't that necessarily include
black people who are women

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,560
and women who are black people?

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,776
Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice,

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
and many times it just doesn't work.

77
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,776
Without frames that allow us to see

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,536
how social problems impact
all the members of a targeted group,

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,776
many will fall through the cracks
of our movements,

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
left to suffer in virtual isolation.

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
But it doesn't have to be this way.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,216
Many years ago, I began to use
the term "intersectionality"

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,336
to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,256
like racism and sexism

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,480
are often overlapping,

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,040
creating multiple levels
of social injustice.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,416
Now, the experience
that gave rise to intersectionality

88
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,400
was my chance encounter
with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,056
Emma DeGraffenreid
was an African-American woman,

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,776
a working wife and a mother.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,216
I actually read about Emma's story
from the pages of a legal opinion

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,376
written by a judge
who had dismissed Emma's claim

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,496
of race and gender discrimination

94
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,720
against a local car manufacturing plant.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,176
Emma, like so many African-American women,

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,976
sought better employment
for her family and for others.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,416
She wanted to create a better life
for her children and for her family.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,656
But she applied for a job,

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,376
and she was not hired,

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,040
and she believed that she was not hired
because she was a black woman.

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,416
Now, the judge in question
dismissed Emma's suit,

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,016
and the argument
for dismissing the suit was

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,376
that the employer
did hire African-Americans

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,760
and the employer hired women.

105
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,416
The real problem, though, that the judge
was not willing to acknowledge

106
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,616
was what Emma was actually trying to say,

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,536
that the African-Americans
that were hired,

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,320
usually for industrial jobs,
maintenance jobs, were all men.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,216
And the women that were hired,

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,856
usually for secretarial
or front-office work,

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
were all white.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,456
Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,136
would he be able to see
the double discrimination

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,280
that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,456
But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,856
to tell her story

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,816
because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that,

118
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,776
she would be able
to have preferential treatment.

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,016
She would have an advantage
by having two swings at the bat,

120
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,680
when African-American men and white women
only had one swing at the bat.

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,456
But of course, neither
African-American men or white women

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,056
needed to combine a race
and gender discrimination claim

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,440
to tell the story of the discrimination
they were experiencing.

124
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,496
Why wasn't the real unfairness

125
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,656
law's refusal to protect
African-American women

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,776
simply because their experiences
weren't exactly the same

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,560
as white women and African-American men?

128
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,536
Rather than broadening the frame
to include African-American women,

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,840
the court simply tossed their case
completely out of court.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,056
Now, as a student
of antidiscrimination law,

131
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,536
as a feminist,

132
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,936
as an antiracist,

133
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,176
I was struck by this case.

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,856
It felt to me like injustice squared.

135
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,976
So first of all,

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,840
black women weren't allowed
to work at the plant.

137
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,616
Second of all, the court
doubled down on this exclusion

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,000
by making it legally inconsequential.

139
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,880
And to boot, there was
no name for this problem.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,096
And we all know that,
where there's no name for a problem,

141
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,376
you can't see a problem,

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,600
and when you can't see a problem,
you pretty much can't solve it.

143
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,775
Many years later, I had come to recognize

144
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,400
that the problem that Emma was facing
was a framing problem.

145
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,096
The frame that the court was using

146
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,096
to see gender discrimination
or to see race discrimination

147
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,040
was partial, and it was distorting.

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,776
For me, the challenge that I faced was

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,616
trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative,

150
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,336
a prism that would allow us
to see Emma's dilemma,

151
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,296
a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law,

152
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
that would allow judges to see her story.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,896
So it occurred to me,

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,936
maybe a simple analogy to an intersection

155
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,240
might allow judges
to better see Emma's dilemma.

156
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,696
So if we think about this intersection,
the roads to the intersection would be

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,640
the way that the workforce
was structured by race and by gender.

158
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,856
And then the traffic in those roads
would be the hiring policies

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,416
and the other practices
that ran through those roads.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,376
Now, because Emma
was both black and female,

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,080
she was positioned precisely
where those roads overlapped,

162
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,976
experiencing the simultaneous impact

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,960
of the company's gender and race traffic.

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,176
The law -- the law is
like that ambulance that shows up

165
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,616
and is ready to treat Emma
only if it can be shown

166
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,256
that she was harmed
on the race road or on the gender road

167
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,120
but not where those roads intersected.

168
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,176
So what do you call
being impacted by multiple forces

169
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,760
and then abandoned to fend for yourself?

170
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,360
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,776
I would go on to learn
that African-American women,

172
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,736
like other women of color,

173
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,816
like other socially marginalized people
all over the world,

174
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,816
were facing all kinds
of dilemmas and challenges

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,936
as a consequence of intersectionality,

176
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,536
intersections of race and gender,

177
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,776
of heterosexism, transphobia,
xenophobia, ableism,

178
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,376
all of these social dynamics come together

179
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,640
and create challenges
that are sometimes quite unique.

180
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,856
But in the same way

181
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,440
that intersectionality

182
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,280
raised our awareness to the way
that black women live their lives,

183
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,416
it also exposes the tragic circumstances

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,600
under which African-American women die.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,960
Police violence against black women

186
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
is very real.

187
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,576
The level of violence
that black women face

188
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,760
is such that it's not surprising

189
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,960
that some of them do not survive
their encounters with police.

190
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,656
Black girls as young as seven,

191
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,400
great grandmothers as old as 95

192
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
have been killed by the police.

193
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,000
They've been killed in their living rooms,

194
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,000
in their bedrooms.

195
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
They've been killed in their cars.

196
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,736
They've been killed on the street.

197
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,616
They've been killed
in front of their parents

198
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,440
and they've been killed
in front of their children.

199
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,800
They have been shot to death.

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,960
They have been stomped to death.

201
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,840
They have been suffocated to death.

202
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,496
They have been manhandled to death.

203
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,000
They have been tasered to death.

204
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
They've been killed
when they've called for help.

205
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,656
They've been killed when they were alone,

206
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,800
and they've been killed
when they were with others.

207
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,640
They've been killed shopping while black,

208
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
driving while black,

209
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,520
having a mental disability while black,

210
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
having a domestic disturbance while black.

211
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,080
They've even been killed
being homeless while black.

212
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,816
They've been killed
talking on the cell phone,

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,216
laughing with friends,

214
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,296
sitting in a car reported as stolen

215
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,936
and making a U-turn
in front of the White House

216
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,800
with an infant strapped
in the backseat of the car.

217
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,840
Why don't we know these stories?

218
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Why is it that their lost lives

219
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,176
don't generate the same amount
of media attention and communal outcry

220
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,360
as the lost lives
of their fallen brothers?

221
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,760
It's time for a change.

222
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
So what can we do?

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,176
In 2014, the African-American
Policy Forum began to demand

224
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,440
that we "say her name"

225
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,200
at rallies, at protests,

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,616
at conferences, at meetings,

227
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,256
anywhere and everywhere

228
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
that state violence against black bodies
is being discussed.

229
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,456
But saying her name is not enough.

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,056
We have to be willing to do more.

231
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,296
We have to be willing to bear witness,

232
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,936
to bear witness
to the often painful realities

233
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,696
that we would just rather not confront,

234
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,176
the everyday violence and humiliation
that many black women have had to face,

235
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,576
black women across color,

236
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,016
age, gender expression,

237
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,320
sexuality and ability.

238
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,216
So we have the opportunity right now --

239
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,256
bearing in mind that some of the images
that I'm about to share with you

240
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,000
may be triggering for some --

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,600
to collectively bear witness
to some of this violence.

242
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,400
We're going to hear the voice
of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.

243
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
And as we sit with these women,

244
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,960
some who have experienced violence
and some who have not survived them,

245
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,896
we have an opportunity

246
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,656
to reverse what happened
at the beginning of this talk,

247
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,376
when we could not stand for these women

248
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,760
because we did not know their names.

249
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,040
So at the end of this clip,
there's going to be a roll call.

250
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,160
Several black women's names will come up.

251
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,736
I'd like those of you who are able
to join us in saying these names

252
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,136
as loud as you can,

253
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,896
randomly, disorderly.

254
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,720
Let's create a cacophony of sound

255
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,720
to represent our intention

256
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,520
to hold these women up,

257
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,936
to sit with them,

258
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,680
to bear witness to them,

259
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,240
to bring them into the light.

260
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,920
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,

261
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,360
say her name.

262
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,760
Say,

263
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,256
say her name.

264
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
(Audience) Shelly!

265
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,816
(Audience) Kayla!

266
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,280
AD: Oh,

267
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,856
say her name.

268
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,416
(Audience shouting names)

269
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,400
Say, say,

270
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,520
say her name.

271
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,656
Say her name.

272
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,536
For all the names

273
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,880
I'll never know,

274
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,776
say her name.

275
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,576
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,
Janisha Fonville,

276
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,936
Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,

277
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,816
Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,

278
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.

279
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,520
AD: Say her name.

280
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,896
KC: So I said at the beginning,

281
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,680
if we can't see a problem,

282
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,320
we can't fix a problem.

283
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,976
Together, we've come together
to bear witness

284
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
to these women's lost lives.

285
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,616
But the time now is to move

286
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,136
from mourning and grief

287
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,920
to action and transformation.

288
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,360
This is something that we can do.

289
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
It's up to us.

290
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,736
Thank you for joining us.

291
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,976
Thank you.

292
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
(Applause)
