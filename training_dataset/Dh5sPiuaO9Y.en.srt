00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,136
In July of 1911,

1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,416
a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor
set out from his rainforest camp

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,056
with his team.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,216
After climbing a steep hill

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,656
and wiping the sweat from his brow,

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,976
he described what he saw beneath him.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,176
He saw rising from
the dense rainforest foliage

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,776
this incredible interlocking
maze of structures

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,096
built of granite,

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,336
beautifully put together.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,976
What's amazing about this project

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,976
is that it was the first funded
by National Geographic,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
and it graced the front cover
of its magazine in 1912.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,776
This professor used state-of-the-art
photography equipment

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,456
to record the site,

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,976
forever changing the face of exploration.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,936
The site was Machu Picchu,

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,960
discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,256
When he saw the site, he asked,

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
"This is an impossible dream.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,480
What could it be?"

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,696
So today,

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,256
100 years later,

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,496
I invite you all
on an incredible journey with me,

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,416
a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,576
(Cheers)

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,016
We will do nothing less
than use state-of-the-art technology

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,960
to map an entire country.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,696
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,136
but we are expanding it to the world,

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,296
making archaeological exploration
more open, inclusive,

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,240
and at a scale simply
not previously possible.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,016
This is why I am so excited

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,136
to share with you all today

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,416
that we will begin
the 2016 TED Prize platform

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
in Latin America,

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,400
more specifically Peru.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,256
(Applause)

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,640
Thank you.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,496
We will be taking
Hiram Bingham's impossible dream

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,735
and turning it into an amazing future

41
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,616
that we can all share in together.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,536
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,536
It has absolutely stunning jewelry,

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,376
like what you can see here.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,416
It has amazing Moche pottery
of human figures.

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,256
It has the Nazca Lines

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,240
and amazing textiles.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,656
So as part of the TED Prize platform,

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,736
we are going to partnering
with some incredible organizations,

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,216
first of all with DigitalGlobe,
the world's largest provider

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,336
of high-resolution
commercial satellite imagery.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,856
They're going to be helping us build out

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,056
this amazing crowdsourcing
platform they have.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,376
Maybe some of you used it

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,656
with the MH370 crash
and search for the airplane.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,856
Of course, they'll also be providing us
with the satellite imagery.

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,696
National Geographic will be helping us
with education and of course exploration.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,136
As well, they'll be providing us
with rich content for the platform,

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,136
including some of the archival imagery
like you saw at the beginning of this talk

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,696
and some of their documentary footage.

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,136
We've already begun
to build and plan the platform,

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,416
and I'm just so excited.

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,896
So here's the cool part.

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,496
My team, headed up by Chase Childs,

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,936
is already beginning to look
at some of the satellite imagery.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,176
Of course, what you can see here
is 0,3-meter data.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,416
This is site called Chan Chan
in northern Peru.

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,416
It dates to 850 AD.

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,816
It's a really amazing city,
but let's zoom in.

70
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,216
This is the type and quality of data
that you all will get to see.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,256
You can see individual structures,
individual buildings.

72
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,656
And we've already begun
to find previously unknown sites.

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,336
What we can say already
is that as part of the platform,

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,976
you will all help discover
thousands of previously unknown sites,

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,496
like this one here,

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,816
and this potentially large one here.

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,296
Unfortunately, we've also begun
to uncover large-scale looting at sites,

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,576
like what you see here.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,616
So many sites in Peru are threatened,

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,696
but the great part
is that all of this data

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,736
is going to be shared
with archaeologists on the front lines

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,080
of protecting these sites.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,696
So I was just in Peru,
meeting with their Minister of Culture

84
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,976
as well as UNESCO.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,176
We'll be collaborating closely with them.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,456
Just so you all know,

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,216
the site is going to be
in both English and Spanish,

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,255
which is absolutely essential to make sure

89
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,216
that people in Peru and across
Latin America can participate.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,296
Our main project coprincipal investigator
is the gentleman you see here,

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,376
Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,696
professor at Catholic University.

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,736
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist
and former vice-minister,

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,896
Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate
and share the data with archaeologists

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,256
so they can explore
these sites on the ground.

96
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,656
He also runs this amazing
drone mapping program,

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,736
some of the images of which
you can see behind me here and here.

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,576
And this data will be incorporated
into the platform,

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,934
and also he'll be helping to image
some of the new sites you help find.

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,376
Our on-the-ground partner

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,576
who will be helping us
with education, outreach,

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,505
as well as site preservation components,

103
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,529
is the Sustainable
Preservation Initiative,

104
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,296
led by Dr. Larry Coben.

105
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,696
Some of you may not be aware

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,816
that some of the world's
poorest communities

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,656
coexist with some of the world's
most well-known archaeological sites.

108
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,136
What SPI does

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,136
is it helps to empower these communities,

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,936
in particular women,

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,056
with new economic approaches
and business training.

112
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,496
So it helps to teach them
to create beautiful handicrafts

113
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,496
which are then sold on to tourists.

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,696
This empowers the women
to treasure their cultural heritage

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,376
and take ownership of it.

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,336
I had the opportunity to spend some time
with 24 of these women

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,976
at a well-known archaeological site
called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,416
These women were unbelievably inspiring,

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,576
and what's great is that SPI
will help us transform communities

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
near some of the sites
that you help to discover.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,936
Peru is just the beginning.

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,576
We're going to be expanding
this platform to the world,

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,816
but already I've gotten
thousands of emails

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,496
from people all across the world --
professors, educators, students,

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,056
and other archaeologists --
who are so excited to help participate.

126
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,696
In fact, they're already suggesting
amazing places for us to help discover,

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,576
including Atlantis.

128
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,216
I don't know if we're going
to be looking for Atlantis,

129
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,456
but you never know.

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,576
So I'm just so excited
to launch this platform.

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,376
It's going to be launched formally
by the end of the year.

132
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,736
And I have to say,

133
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,616
if what my team has already discovered
in the past few weeks are any indication,

134
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,056
what the world discovers
is just going to be beyond imagination.

135
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,136
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.

136
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,496
Thank you very much.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,336
(Applause)

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,576
Thank you.

139
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
(Applause)
