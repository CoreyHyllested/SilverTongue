00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,388
As a singer-songwriter,

1
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:19,127
people often ask me about my influences
or, as I like to call them,

2
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,539
my sonic lineages.

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,191
And I could easily tell you

4
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:26,635
that I was shaped by the jazz
and hip hop that I grew up with,

5
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,970
by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,

6
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,897
or by the 1980s pop
on my childhood radio stations.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,374
But beyond genre,
there is another question:

8
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:42,240
how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make?

9
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:44,600
I believe that everyday soundscape

10
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:48,065
can be the most unexpected
inspiration for songwriting,

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,604
and to look at this idea
a little bit more closely,

12
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:52,749
I'm going to talk today
about three things:

13
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:55,797
nature, language and silence --

14
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:59,154
or rather, the impossibility
of true silence.

15
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,357
And through this I hope to give you
a sense of a world

16
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,432
already alive with musical expression,

17
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:09,437
with each of us serving
as active participants,

18
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,716
whether we know it or not.

19
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,954
I'm going to start today with nature,
but before we do that,

20
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:18,250
let's quickly listen to this snippet
of an opera singer warming up.

21
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:19,758
Here it is.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,700
(Singing)

23
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,060
(Singing ends)

24
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:39,408
It's beautiful, isn't it?

25
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,352
Gotcha!

26
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,812
That is actually not the sound
of an opera singer warming up.

27
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:47,660
That is the sound of a bird

28
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:49,606
slowed down to a pace

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,352
that the human ear mistakenly
recognizes as its own.

30
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:58,816
It was released as part of Peter Szöke's
1987 Hungarian recording

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,222
"The Unknown Music of Birds,"

32
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,117
where he records many birds
and slows down their pitches

33
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,748
to reveal what's underneath.

34
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,644
Let's listen to the full-speed recording.

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,110
(Bird singing)

36
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,550
Now, let's hear the two of them together

37
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,146
so your brain can juxtapose them.

38
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:25,167
(Bird singing at slow then full speed)

39
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,338
(Singing ends)

40
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,254
It's incredible.

41
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:48,126
Perhaps the techniques of opera singing
were inspired by birdsong.

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,768
As humans, we intuitively understand birds
to be our musical teachers.

43
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,343
In Ethiopia, birds
are considered an integral part

44
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,973
of the origin of music itself.

45
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,017
The story goes like this:

46
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:08,571
1,500 years ago, a young man
was born in the Empire of Aksum,

47
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,142
a major trading center
of the ancient world.

48
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,066
His name was Yared.

49
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,610
When Yared was seven years old
his father died,

50
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:21,257
and his mother sent him to go live
with an uncle, who was a priest

51
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,576
of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,734
one of the oldest churches in the world.

53
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:30,353
Now, this tradition has an enormous amount
of scholarship and learning,

54
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,389
and Yared had to study and study
and study and study,

55
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,029
and one day he was studying under a tree,

56
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,580
when three birds came to him.

57
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:42,389
One by one, these birds
became his teachers.

58
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,204
They taught him music -- scales, in fact.

59
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,082
And Yared, eventually
recognized as Saint Yared,

60
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:54,544
used these scales to compose
five volumes of chants and hymns

61
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,740
for worship and celebration.

62
00:03:56,764 --> 00:04:00,153
And he used these scales
to compose and to create

63
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,927
an indigenous musical notation system.

64
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:07,268
And these scales evolved
into what is known as kiñit,

65
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:13,185
the unique, pentatonic, five-note,
modal system that is very much alive

66
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,433
and thriving and still evolving
in Ethiopia today.

67
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,694
Now, I love this story because
it's true at multiple levels.

68
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:24,741
Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,

69
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,714
and the natural world
can be our musical teacher.

70
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,211
And we have so many examples of this:

71
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:33,458
the Pygmies of the Congo
tune their instruments

72
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,082
to the pitches of the birds
in the forest around them.

73
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:39,574
Musician and natural soundscape
expert Bernie Krause describes

74
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:42,972
how a healthy environment
has animals and insects

75
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:46,424
taking up low, medium
and high-frequency bands,

76
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:49,642
in exactly the same way
as a symphony does.

77
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:54,429
And countless works of music
were inspired by bird and forest song.

78
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:59,845
Yes, the natural world
can be our cultural teacher.

79
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:04,124
So let's go now to the uniquely
human world of language.

80
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,327
Every language communicates
with pitch to varying degrees,

81
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,789
whether it's Mandarin Chinese,

82
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:13,805
where a shift in melodic inflection
gives the same phonetic syllable

83
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,586
an entirely different meaning,

84
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,952
to a language like English,

85
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:19,346
where a raised pitch
at the end of a sentence ...

86
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,388
(Going up in pitch) implies a question?

87
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:23,021
(Laughter)

88
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,704
As an Ethiopian-American woman,

89
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:27,136
I grew up around the language
of Amharic, Amhariña.

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,639
It was my first language,
the language of my parents,

91
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,220
one of the main languages of Ethiopia.

92
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:35,910
And there are a million reasons
to fall in love with this language:

93
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,775
its depth of poetics,
its double entendres,

94
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,416
its wax and gold, its humor,

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,330
its proverbs that illuminate
the wisdom and follies of life.

96
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,117
But there's also this melodicism,
a musicality built right in.

97
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,609
And I find this distilled most clearly

98
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,106
in what I like to call
emphatic language --

99
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,366
language that's meant
to highlight or underline

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,445
or that springs from surprise.

101
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:02,443
Take, for example, the word: "indey."

102
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,306
Now, if there are Ethiopians
in the audience,

103
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,337
they're probably chuckling to themselves,

104
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,445
because the word means
something like "No!"

105
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,280
or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."

106
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,405
It kind of depends on the situation.

107
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:17,280
But when I was a kid,
this was my very favorite word,

108
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:20,404
and I think it's because it has a pitch.

109
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,932
It has a melody.

110
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:24,957
You can almost see the shape
as it springs from someone's mouth.

111
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,710
"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.

112
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,480
And as a musician and composer,
when I hear that word,

113
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,573
something like this
is floating through my mind.

114
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:40,982
(Music and singing "Indey")

115
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,832
(Music ends)

116
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,702
Or take, for example, the phrase
for "It is right" or "It is correct" --

117
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,298
"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."

118
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,955
It's an affirmation, an agreement.

119
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,137
"Lickih nehu."

120
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,313
When I hear that phrase,

121
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,834
something like this starts rolling
through my mind.

122
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:09,031
(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")

123
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:13,572
(Music ends)

124
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,016
And in both of those cases,
what I did was I took the melody

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,499
and the phrasing
of those words and phrases

126
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:24,089
and I turned them into musical parts
to use in these short compositions.

127
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,020
And I like to write bass lines,

128
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,095
so they both ended up
kind of as bass lines.

129
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:32,013
Now, this is based on the work
of Jason Moran and others

130
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:35,075
who work intimately
with music and language,

131
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,043
but it's also something I've had
in my head since I was a kid,

132
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,098
how musical my parents sounded

133
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,274
when they were speaking
to each other and to us.

134
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,444
It was from them
and from Amhariña that I learned

135
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,348
that we are awash in musical expression

136
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,987
with every word,
every sentence that we speak,

137
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,763
every word, every sentence
that we receive.

138
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:59,046
Perhaps you can hear it
in the words I'm speaking even now.

139
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,652
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States

140
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:06,587
and the most seminal work
of 20th century avant-garde composition:

141
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,735
John Cage's "4:33,"

142
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,993
written for any instrument
or combination of instruments.

143
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:16,471
The musician or musicians are invited
to walk onto the stage

144
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,685
with a stopwatch and open the score,

145
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,640
which was actually purchased
by the Museum of Modern Art --

146
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,046
the score, that is.

147
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:28,149
And this score has not
a single note written

148
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,647
and there is not a single note played

149
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,403
for four minutes and 33 seconds.

150
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,230
And, at once enraging and enrapturing,

151
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,142
Cage shows us that even
when there are no strings

152
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:47,214
being plucked by fingers
or hands hammering piano keys,

153
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:49,715
still there is music,
still there is music,

154
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,801
still there is music.

155
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,953
And what is this music?

156
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:57,108
It was that sneeze in the back.

157
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,678
(Laughter)

158
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:03,762
It is the everyday soundscape
that arises from the audience themselves:

159
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:08,056
their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,
their whispers, their sneezes,

160
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,621
the room, the wood
of the floors and the walls

161
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:13,103
expanding and contracting,
creaking and groaning

162
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,531
with the heat and the cold,

163
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,646
the pipes clanking and contributing.

164
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:22,946
And controversial though it was,
and even controversial though it remains,

165
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,214
Cage's point is that there is no
such thing as true silence.

166
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:32,612
Even in the most silent environments,
we still hear and feel the sound

167
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,163
of our own heartbeats.

168
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:37,814
The world is alive
with musical expression.

169
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:40,590
We are already immersed.

170
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,023
Now, I had my own moment of,
let's say, remixing John Cage

171
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,714
a couple of months ago

172
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,741
when I was standing
in front of the stove cooking lentils.

173
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:53,907
And it was late one night
and it was time to stir,

174
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,903
so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,

175
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,360
and I placed it onto
the kitchen counter next to me,

176
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:00,647
and it started to roll back and forth

177
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,432
making this sound.

178
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:09,765
(Sound of metal lid
clanking against a counter)

179
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,079
(Clanking ends)

180
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,059
And it stopped me cold.

181
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:20,950
I thought, "What a weird, cool swing
that cooking pan lid has."

182
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,784
So when the lentils were ready and eaten,

183
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:30,302
I hightailed it to my backyard studio,

184
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,169
and I made this.

185
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:38,187
(Music, including the sound
of the lid, and singing)

186
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,421
(Music ends)

187
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,891
Now, John Cage
wasn't instructing musicians

188
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:58,610
to mine the soundscape
for sonic textures to turn into music.

189
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,913
He was saying that on its own,

190
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:05,398
the environment is musically generative,

191
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:09,663
that it is generous, that it is fertile,

192
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,850
that we are already immersed.

193
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:18,778
Musician, music researcher, surgeon
and human hearing expert Charles Limb

194
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,857
is a professor at Johns Hopkins University

195
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,150
and he studies music and the brain.

196
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:26,505
And he has a theory

197
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:30,831
that it is possible -- it is possible --

198
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:36,003
that the human auditory system
actually evolved to hear music,

199
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:41,098
because it is so much more complex
than it needs to be for language alone.

200
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,508
And if that's true,

201
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:46,477
it means that we're hard-wired for music,

202
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,614
that we can find it anywhere,

203
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:51,716
that there is no such thing
as a musical desert,

204
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,439
that we are permanently
hanging out at the oasis,

205
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,520
and that is marvelous.

206
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,328
We can add to the soundtrack,
but it's already playing.

207
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,114
And it doesn't mean don't study music.

208
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:08,634
Study music, trace your sonic lineages
and enjoy that exploration.

209
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:13,090
But there is a kind of sonic lineage
to which we all belong.

210
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,890
So the next time you are seeking
percussion inspiration,

211
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:20,263
look no further than your tires,
as they roll over the unusual grooves

212
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,011
of the freeway,

213
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,213
or the top-right burner of your stove

214
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:25,946
and that strange way that it clicks

215
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,032
as it is preparing to light.

216
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,345
When seeking melodic inspiration,

217
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,861
look no further than dawn
and dusk avian orchestras

218
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:37,113
or to the natural lilt
of emphatic language.

219
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,136
We are the audience
and we are the composers

220
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,955
and we take from these pieces

221
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,130
we are given.

222
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:45,022
We make, we make, we make, we make,

223
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:49,466
knowing that when it comes to nature
or language or soundscape,

224
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,487
there is no end to the inspiration --

225
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,945
if we are listening.

226
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:56,573
Thank you.

227
00:12:56,597 --> 00:13:02,371
(Applause)
