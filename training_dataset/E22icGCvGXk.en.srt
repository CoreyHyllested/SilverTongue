00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,563
Four years ago today, exactly, actually,

1
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:17,659
I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.

2
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:21,779
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine

3
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,654
for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.

4
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:29,845
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and

5
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:32,985
the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"

6
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,232
and the MS Paint quality of my slides

7
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:38,544
was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,

8
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,160
and has nothing to do with my inability

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,505
to use PowerPoint. (Laughter)

10
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:48,065
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.

11
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,936
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about

12
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,352
what makes a strong female character,

13
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,440
and, you know, movies and TV shows,

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,706
these things have influence. My own website.

15
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,497
So I think the question of what makes a strong female

16
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,874
character often goes misinterpreted,

17
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:08,167
and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen

18
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,759
who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,

19
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,352
like a Catwoman type,

20
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:18,230
or she plays her sexuality up a lot,

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,422
and it's seen as power.

22
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:22,821
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.

23
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,549
They're completely flat,

24
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,033
and they're basically cardboard characters.

25
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,850
The problem with this is that then

26
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:32,712
people expect women to be that easy to understand,

27
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:35,039
and women are mad at themselves

28
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,381
for not being that simple,

29
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:39,338
when, in actuality, women are complicated,

30
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:42,736
women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,

31
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,488
but because people are crazy,

32
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:48,150
and women happen to be people. (Laughter)

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,420
So the flaws are the key.

34
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,278
I'm not the first person to say this.

35
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,326
What makes a strong female character

36
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:59,230
is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,214
who is maybe not immediately likable,

38
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:03,676
but eventually relatable.

39
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,145
I don't like to acknowledge a problem

40
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:07,811
without also acknowledging those who work to fix it,

41
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,878
so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"

42
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,758
movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters

43
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,889
or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.

44
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,105
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO

45
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,296
that premiers next month, "Girls,"

46
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,813
she said she wanted to start it because she felt that

47
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,801
every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,

48
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:32,009
and that feels accurate for all people,

49
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,673
but you don't see women represented like that as much.

50
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:38,257
Congrats, guys. (Laughs)

51
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:41,960
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,496
of women who are not represented that way,

53
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,952
and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,

54
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:50,232
because I think teenagers are especially contradictory

55
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,272
and still figuring it out,

56
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:56,621
and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"

57
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:59,400
and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,056
Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,

59
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,744
I mean, the whole premise of the shows

60
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:08,190
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,

61
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,288
but those shows only lasted a season each,

62
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:16,250
and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.

63
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,636
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —

64
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,093
around the time when I was,

65
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,750
when I started watching those TV shows.

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,945
I was ending middle school, starting high school --

67
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,209
I'm a sophomore now —

68
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,965
and I was trying to reconcile

69
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,624
all of these differences that you're told you can't be

70
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,971
when you're growing up as a girl.

71
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,591
You can't be smart and pretty.

72
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:43,414
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.

73
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,308
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake

74
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:50,341
of what other people, usually men, will think of you.

75
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:53,312
So I was trying to figure all that out,

76
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,613
and I felt a little confused,

77
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,355
and I said so on my blog,

78
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:02,540
and I said that I wanted to start

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,044
a website for teenage girls

80
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,482
that was not this kind of one-dimensional

81
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,186
strong character empowerment thing

82
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:14,176
because I think one thing that can be very alienating

83
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,808
about a misconception of feminism is that

84
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:20,403
girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to

85
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,894
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,

86
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:26,305
never being insecure, never having doubts,

87
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:29,207
having all of the answers. And this is not true,

88
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:33,260
and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling

89
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,003
became easier once I understood that feminism

90
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,206
was not a rulebook but a discussion,

91
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,330
a conversation, a process,

92
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,501
and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year

93
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,851
when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit

94
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,954
on the illustration front since.

95
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:53,928
But, yeah.

96
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:58,343
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication

97
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,832
for teenage girls and ask people to submit

98
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,937
their writing, their photography, whatever,

99
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,603
to be a member of our staff.

100
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,527
I got about 3,000 emails.

101
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:10,199
My editorial director and I went through them and

102
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,202
put together a staff of people,

103
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,802
and we launched last September.

104
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:18,157
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,

105
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:21,511
where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,

106
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,240
we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,199
give girls the answers, and not even give them permission

108
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,773
to find the answers themselves,

109
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:32,941
but hopefully inspire them to understand that

110
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,664
they can give themselves that permission,

111
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:37,548
they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,

112
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,299
all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it

113
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:45,642
a nice place for all of that to be figured out.

114
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,577
So I'm not saying, "Be like us,"

115
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:49,945
and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,

116
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:55,057
but we just want to help represent girls

117
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,078
in a way that shows those different dimensions.

118
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:01,872
I mean, we have articles called

119
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:05,054
"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"

120
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:07,021
but we also have articles like,

121
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:10,982
oops -- I'm figuring it out!

122
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,508
Ha ha. (Laughter)

123
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:17,306
If you use that, you can get away with anything.

124
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,497
We also have articles called

125
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:22,003
"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."

126
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:25,036
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate

127
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:29,003
those characters in movies and

128
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,816
articles like that on our site,

129
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:34,059
that aren't just about being totally powerful,

130
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,109
maybe finding your acceptance with yourself

131
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:42,668
and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

132
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:46,286
So what I you to take away from my talk,

133
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:50,508
the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.

134
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:53,882
Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)

135
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,761
Because my favorite thing about her,

136
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,821
other than, like, everything, is that

137
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:02,229
she is very -- has always been

138
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,134
unapologetically present on stage,

139
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,941
and unapologetic about her flaws

140
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,079
and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings

141
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,671
and she makes you listen to them and think about them,

142
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,053
and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.

143
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:22,151
Thank you. (Applause)
