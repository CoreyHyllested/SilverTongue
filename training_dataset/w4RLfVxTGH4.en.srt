0
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:15,469
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment

1
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,873
that you're a soldier
in the heat of battle.

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,261
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
or a medieval archer

3
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:24,165
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:28,443
Regardless of your time and place,
there are some things that are constant.

5
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,361
Your adrenaline is elevated,

6
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:35,194
and your actions are stemming
from these deeply ingrained reflexes,

7
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:39,574
reflexes rooted in a need
to protect yourself and your side

8
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,287
and to defeat the enemy.

9
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:46,363
So now, I'd like you to imagine
playing a very different role,

10
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:47,988
that of the scout.

11
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:51,401
The scout's job is not
to attack or defend.

12
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,820
The scout's job is to understand.

13
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,294
The scout is the one going out,

14
00:00:56,318 --> 00:01:00,381
mapping the terrain,
identifying potential obstacles.

15
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,981
And the scout may hope to learn
that, say, there's a bridge

16
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:06,339
in a convenient location across a river.

17
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:09,410
But above all, the scout
wants to know what's really there,

18
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,027
as accurately as possible.

19
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:17,241
And in a real, actual army, both
the soldier and the scout are essential.

20
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:22,575
But you can also think of each
of these roles as a mindset --

21
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,226
a metaphor for how all of us
process information and ideas

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,717
in our daily lives.

23
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:32,022
What I'm going to argue today
is that having good judgment,

24
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:35,260
making accurate predictions,
making good decisions,

25
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:38,042
is mostly about which mindset you're in.

26
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:41,587
To illustrate these mindsets in action,

27
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:45,095
I'm going to take you back
to 19th-century France,

28
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,102
where this innocuous-looking
piece of paper

29
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:51,164
launched one of the biggest
political scandals in history.

30
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,115
It was discovered in 1894
by officers in the French general staff.

31
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,308
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,

32
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:01,257
but when they pieced it back together,

33
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,313
they discovered
that someone in their ranks

34
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,700
had been selling
military secrets to Germany.

35
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,819
So they launched a big investigation,

36
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:12,709
and their suspicions
quickly converged on this man,

37
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,065
Alfred Dreyfus.

38
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,185
He had a sterling record,

39
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,729
no past history of wrongdoing,
no motive as far as they could tell.

40
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:25,460
But Dreyfus was the only
Jewish officer at that rank in the army,

41
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:29,659
and unfortunately at this time,
the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.

42
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,905
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting
to that on the memo

43
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,866
and concluded that it was a match,

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,932
even though outside
professional handwriting experts

45
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,106
were much less confident
in the similarity,

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,520
but never mind that.

47
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,584
They went and searched
Dreyfus's apartment,

48
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,364
looking for any signs of espionage.

49
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:48,348
They went through his files,
and they didn't find anything.

50
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:51,506
This just convinced them more
that Dreyfus was not only guilty,

51
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,823
but sneaky as well, because clearly
he had hidden all of the evidence

52
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,696
before they had managed to get to it.

53
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,904
Next, they went and looked
through his personal history

54
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:02,229
for any incriminating details.

55
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,855
They talked to his teachers,

56
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,664
they found that he had studied
foreign languages in school,

57
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,741
which clearly showed a desire
to conspire with foreign governments

58
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:11,948
later in life.

59
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:17,983
His teachers also said that Dreyfus
was known for having a good memory,

60
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,119
which was highly suspicious, right?

61
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:23,483
You know, because a spy
has to remember a lot of things.

62
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,099
So the case went to trial,
and Dreyfus was found guilty.

63
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:32,136
Afterwards, they took him out
into this public square

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,884
and ritualistically tore
his insignia from his uniform

65
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,813
and broke his sword in two.

66
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,852
This was called
the Degradation of Dreyfus.

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,377
And they sentenced him
to life imprisonment

68
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:46,141
on the aptly named Devil's Island,

69
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,989
which is this barren rock
off the coast of South America.

70
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:53,306
So there he went,
and there he spent his days alone,

71
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,834
writing letters and letters
to the French government

72
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:59,166
begging them to reopen his case
so they could discover his innocence.

73
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,547
But for the most part,
France considered the matter closed.

74
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:07,594
One thing that's really interesting
to me about the Dreyfus Affair

75
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:11,396
is this question of why the officers
were so convinced

76
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,141
that Dreyfus was guilty.

77
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,403
I mean, you might even assume
that they were setting him up,

78
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,395
that they were intentionally framing him.

79
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,686
But historians don't think
that's what happened.

80
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,869
As far as we can tell,

81
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:26,130
the officers genuinely believed
that the case against Dreyfus was strong.

82
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:28,630
Which makes you wonder:

83
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,928
What does it say about the human mind

84
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:33,265
that we can find such paltry evidence

85
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,376
to be compelling enough to convict a man?

86
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,496
Well, this is a case of what scientists
call "motivated reasoning."

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,574
It's this phenomenon in which
our unconscious motivations,

88
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,950
our desires and fears,

89
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,320
shape the way we interpret information.

90
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,754
Some information, some ideas,
feel like our allies.

91
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:54,420
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.

92
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,975
And other information
or ideas are the enemy,

93
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,567
and we want to shoot them down.

94
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:03,115
So this is why I call
motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."

95
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,993
Probably most of you have never persecuted

96
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:09,298
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,

97
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,795
I assume,

98
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,678
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed

99
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:19,824
that when the referee judges
that your team committed a foul,

100
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:21,010
for example,

101
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:24,127
you're highly motivated
to find reasons why he's wrong.

102
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,594
But if he judges that the other team
committed a foul -- awesome!

103
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,180
That's a good call,
let's not examine it too closely.

104
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,909
Or, maybe you've read
an article or a study

105
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,639
that examined some controversial policy,

106
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:36,879
like capital punishment.

107
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,852
And, as researchers have demonstrated,

108
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,581
if you support capital punishment

109
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,121
and the study shows
that it's not effective,

110
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:47,391
then you're highly motivated
to find all the reasons

111
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,588
why the study was poorly designed.

112
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,818
But if it shows
that capital punishment works,

113
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,001
it's a good study.

114
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:56,273
And vice versa: if you don't
support capital punishment, same thing.

115
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:59,126
Our judgment is strongly
influenced, unconsciously,

116
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,428
by which side we want to win.

117
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,960
And this is ubiquitous.

118
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:07,022
This shapes how we think
about our health, our relationships,

119
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,942
how we decide how to vote,

120
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,334
what we consider fair or ethical.

121
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,799
What's most scary to me
about motivated reasoning

122
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:15,974
or soldier mindset,

123
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,245
is how unconscious it is.

124
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:20,549
We can think we're being
objective and fair-minded

125
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:24,040
and still wind up ruining the life
of an innocent man.

126
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:27,891
However, fortunately for Dreyfus,
his story is not over.

127
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,283
This is Colonel Picquart.

128
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,851
He's another high-ranking officer
in the French Army,

129
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,504
and like most people,
he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.

130
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:39,318
Also like most people in the army,
he was at least casually anti-Semitic.

131
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:42,707
But at a certain point,
Picquart began to suspect:

132
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,077
"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"

133
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,626
What happened was,
he had discovered evidence

134
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,127
that the spying for Germany had continued,

135
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:53,126
even after Dreyfus was in prison.

136
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:56,812
And he had also discovered
that another officer in the army

137
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:59,409
had handwriting that perfectly
matched the memo,

138
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,794
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.

139
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:05,223
So he brought these discoveries
to his superiors,

140
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:09,694
but to his dismay,
they either didn't care

141
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,306
or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings,

142
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,703
like, "Well, all you've really shown,
Picquart, is that there's another spy

143
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,100
who learned how to mimic
Dreyfus's handwriting,

144
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,664
and he picked up the torch of spying
after Dreyfus left.

145
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,798
But Dreyfus is still guilty."

146
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:30,879
Eventually, Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated.

147
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:32,431
But it took him 10 years,

148
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,986
and for part of that time,
he himself was in prison

149
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,308
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.

150
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:44,491
A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story

151
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:48,744
because he was an anti-Semite
and that's bad, which I agree with.

152
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:53,974
But personally, for me,
the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic

153
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:56,583
actually makes his actions more admirable,

154
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,723
because he had the same prejudices,
the same reasons to be biased

155
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,532
as his fellow officers,

156
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:06,191
but his motivation to find the truth
and uphold it trumped all of that.

157
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,297
So to me,

158
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,127
Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."

159
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,674
It's the drive not to make
one idea win or another lose,

160
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,622
but just to see what's really there

161
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:21,121
as honestly and accurately as you can,

162
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:24,425
even if it's not pretty
or convenient or pleasant.

163
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,690
This mindset is what
I'm personally passionate about.

164
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:33,843
And I've spent the last few years
examining and trying to figure out

165
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,850
what causes scout mindset.

166
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:39,022
Why are some people, sometimes at least,

167
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:42,834
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations

168
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,153
and just try to see the facts
and the evidence

169
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:46,650
as objectively as they can?

170
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:50,613
And the answer is emotional.

171
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:54,886
So, just as soldier mindset
is rooted in emotions

172
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,898
like defensiveness or tribalism,

173
00:08:58,615 --> 00:08:59,981
scout mindset is, too.

174
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,991
It's just rooted in different emotions.

175
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:05,434
For example, scouts are curious.

176
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,004
They're more likely to say
they feel pleasure

177
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,688
when they learn new information

178
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:13,023
or an itch to solve a puzzle.

179
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:16,713
They're more likely to feel intrigued
when they encounter something

180
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,833
that contradicts their expectations.

181
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,183
Scouts also have different values.

182
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:24,279
They're more likely to say
they think it's virtuous

183
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:25,792
to test your own beliefs,

184
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,522
and they're less likely to say
that someone who changes his mind

185
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:30,808
seems weak.

186
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,717
And above all, scouts are grounded,

187
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:36,646
which means their self-worth as a person

188
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,136
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.

189
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,414
So they can believe
that capital punishment works.

190
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,251
If studies come out showing
that it doesn't, they can say,

191
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:52,184
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."

192
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:58,280
This cluster of traits
is what researchers have found --

193
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:00,010
and I've also found anecdotally --

194
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,865
predicts good judgment.

195
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:05,669
And the key takeaway I want
to leave you with about those traits

196
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:09,330
is that they're primarily
not about how smart you are

197
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,352
or about how much you know.

198
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:14,182
In fact, they don't correlate
very much with IQ at all.

199
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,288
They're about how you feel.

200
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,872
There's a quote that I keep
coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.

201
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,837
He's the author of "The Little Prince."

202
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:25,630
He said, "If you want to build a ship,

203
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,855
don't drum up your men
to collect wood and give orders

204
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,299
and distribute the work.

205
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:37,236
Instead, teach them to yearn
for the vast and endless sea."

206
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:40,398
In other words, I claim,

207
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,010
if we really want to improve
our judgment as individuals

208
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,477
and as societies,

209
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:49,010
what we need most
is not more instruction in logic

210
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,582
or rhetoric or probability or economics,

211
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:54,689
even though those things
are quite valuable.

212
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:58,017
But what we most need
to use those principles well

213
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,459
is scout mindset.

214
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,363
We need to change the way we feel.

215
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,569
We need to learn how to feel proud
instead of ashamed

216
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,231
when we notice we might
have been wrong about something.

217
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:11,383
We need to learn how to feel intrigued
instead of defensive

218
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:15,650
when we encounter some information
that contradicts our beliefs.

219
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:19,415
So the question I want
to leave you with is:

220
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,967
What do you most yearn for?

221
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,398
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?

222
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,722
Or do you yearn to see the world
as clearly as you possibly can?

223
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,503
Thank you.

224
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:36,524
(Applause)
