00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,995
Tonight, I want to have a conversation about

2
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,929
this incredible global issue

3
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:21,466
that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,

4
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:22,787
something we can all relate to,

5
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,517
and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.

6
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:28,794
But first, I want to take you on a little journey.

7
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:31,590
Let's first visit our planet, but at night,

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,126
and from space.

9
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:36,077
This is what our planet looks like from outer space

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,215
at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel

11
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:41,069
around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,

12
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,386
of course, is how dominant the human presence

13
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,450
on our planet is.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,185
We see cities, we see oil fields,

15
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:52,382
you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,

16
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,946
that we are dominating much of our planet,

17
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:56,719
and mostly through the use of energy

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,453
that we see here at night.

19
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,627
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper

20
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,669
and look during the daytime.

21
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:06,359
What we see during the day is our landscapes.

22
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,912
This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called RondÃ´nia

23
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:13,502
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.

24
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:16,118
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,

25
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,644
you're going to see a thin white line,

26
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,022
which is a road that was built in the 1970s.

27
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:25,689
If we come back to the same place in 2001,

28
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,946
what we're going to find is that these roads

29
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:31,796
spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,

30
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:34,937
at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest

31
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:37,098
where there are going to be a few cows.

32
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,410
These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.

33
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,041
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,

34
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,825
in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.

35
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:48,561
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation

36
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,146
is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,

37
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:53,374
especially in this part of the world.

38
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:56,697
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,

39
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:59,089
we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,

40
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:03,225
here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,

41
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,787
there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,

42
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,099
and there's a lone farmer out there

43
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,662
in the middle of the primeval jungle.

44
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:15,435
Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,

45
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,963
and we'll see that that landscape actually looks

46
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,845
a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.

47
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:24,213
In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.

48
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,086
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China

49
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:30,832
as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare

50
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:33,373
about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals

51
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:36,803
animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.

52
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,415
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.

53
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,207
So soybeans have really exploded,

54
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,832
showing how trade and globalization are

55
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,704
really responsible for the connections to rainforests

56
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:49,641
and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange

57
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,357
and interconnected world that we have today.

58
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,678
Well, again and again, what we find as we look

59
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,814
around the world in our little tour of the world

60
00:02:56,814 --> 00:03:00,565
is that landscape after landscape after landscape

61
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,334
have been cleared and altered for growing food

62
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,669
and other crops.

63
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:08,029
So one of the questions we've been asking is,

64
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,517
how much of the world is used to grow food,

65
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:12,913
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that

66
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:15,407
into the future, and what does it mean?

67
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,375
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,

68
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,295
using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track

69
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,479
farming on a global scale.

70
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,191
And this is what we found, and it's startling.

71
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,982
This map shows the presence of agriculture

72
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:32,046
on planet Earth.

73
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,006
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,

74
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,207
like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.

75
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:42,471
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.

76
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,595
If you put it all together in one place,

77
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,262
it'd be the size of South America.

78
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,938
The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures

79
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,155
and rangelands, where our animals live.

80
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:54,871
That area's about 30 million square kilometers,

81
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,290
or about an Africa's worth of land,

82
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,203
a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,

83
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,355
is what you see. And what's left is, like,

84
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,366
the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,

85
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,057
or the middle of a rain forest.

86
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,802
We're using a planet's worth of land already.

87
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:12,593
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent

88
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,305
of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,

89
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,874
and it's 60 times larger

90
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:20,449
than all the areas we complain about,

91
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,666
our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.

92
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,529
Half of humanity lives in cities today,

93
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,465
but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.

94
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,384
So this is an amazing kind of result,

95
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,561
and it really shocked us when we looked at that.

96
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,265
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,

97
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,971
but also we're using a lot of water.

98
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,499
This is a photograph flying into Arizona,

99
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,308
and when you look at it, you're like,

100
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,435
"What are they growing here?" It turns out

101
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:47,367
they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert

102
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,755
using water sprayed on top.

103
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,305
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold

104
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:53,981
in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.

105
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,293
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come

106
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,837
from some place, and it comes from here,

107
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,477
the Colorado River in North America.

108
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:04,125
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,

109
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,244
this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,

110
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:09,029
kind of an average day, it looks something like this.

111
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:11,933
But if we come back today, during a normal condition

112
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,501
to the exact same location, this is what's left.

113
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,503
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,

114
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:22,059
or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.

115
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,979
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water

116
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,386
and using it to grow food,

117
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:30,066
and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,

118
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,346
it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.

119
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:36,474
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America

120
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,602
for irrigation.

121
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,358
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.

122
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,178
This probably is: the Aral Sea.

123
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:46,082
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.

124
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:48,141
This is in the former Soviet Union

125
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,713
in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,

126
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:53,161
one of the great inland seas of the world.

127
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,473
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like

128
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:58,995
it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?

129
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,958
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,

130
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,450
you see two little rivers kind of coming down

131
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,967
through the sand, feeding this basin with water.

132
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,549
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains

133
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,482
far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river

134
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:15,682
through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.

135
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:19,694
Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water

136
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:22,047
to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,

137
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,827
in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets

138
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,887
to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.

139
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,813
They really needed the money.

140
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:31,809
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off

141
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,739
the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?

142
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,187
Here it is in 1973,

143
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,399
1986,

144
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,203
1999,

145
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:45,258
2004,

146
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:49,923
and about 11 months ago.

147
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,972
It's pretty extraordinary.

148
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:55,163
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.

149
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,823
Imagine that was Lake Superior.

150
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:01,097
Imagine that was Lake Huron.

151
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,704
It's an extraordinary change.

152
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:05,047
This is not only a change in water and

153
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,416
where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals

154
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,673
of the environment of this region.

155
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:10,957
Let's start with this.

156
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,167
The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.

157
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,707
Let's put it that way.

158
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,111
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.

159
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,055
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things

160
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,471
that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.

161
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,603
One of those small islands that was remote

162
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,215
and impossible to get to was a site

163
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,911
of Soviet biological weapons testing.

164
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,265
You can walk there today.

165
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,812
Weather patterns have changed.

166
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:35,121
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only

167
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,071
in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.

168
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,951
This is an environmental disaster writ large.

169
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:42,446
But let's bring it home.

170
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:45,175
This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago

171
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,824
that he took when he was in the Soviet Union

172
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,086
a long, long time ago,

173
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:51,082
showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.

174
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,240
You see the canal they dug?

175
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,704
They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into

176
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,920
the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up

177
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,384
because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't

178
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,554
keep up with the retreating shoreline.

179
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,565
I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future

180
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:06,963
archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about

181
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,783
our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"

182
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:12,811
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.

183
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,724
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water

184
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,916
that's sustainable, and agriculture alone

185
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,316
is 70 percent of that.

186
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,476
So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.

187
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:26,820
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.

188
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,156
Usually when we think about the atmosphere,

189
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:31,804
we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,

190
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,860
and mostly around energy,

191
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,496
but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters

192
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,548
of greenhouse gases too.

193
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,604
If you look at carbon dioxide from

194
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,756
burning tropical rainforest,

195
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,316
or methane coming from cows and rice,

196
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,229
or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,

197
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:51,000
it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,016
gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.

199
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,870
That's more than all our transportation.

200
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,620
It's more than all our electricity.

201
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,245
It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.

202
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:03,355
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases

203
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,675
of any human activity in the world.

204
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,301
And yet, we don't talk about it very much.

205
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:11,354
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture

206
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:13,491
dominating our planet,

207
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,849
whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,

208
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,957
70 percent of the water we use,

209
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,682
30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

210
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:23,531
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus

211
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,994
around the world simply by using fertilizers,

212
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,765
causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,

213
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,482
lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest

214
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:34,157
driver of biodiversity loss.

215
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,258
So without a doubt, agriculture is

216
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:39,938
the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet

217
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,557
since the end of the ice age. No question.

218
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:45,537
And it rivals climate change in importance.

219
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:48,462
And they're both happening at the same time.

220
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,834
But what's really important here to remember is that

221
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:54,102
it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.

222
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,282
In fact, we completely depend on it.

223
00:09:56,282 --> 00:10:00,722
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.

224
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,866
We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,

225
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:06,722
fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people

226
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,458
in the world today, and if anything,

227
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,488
we're going to have the demands on agriculture

228
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:14,026
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.

229
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,257
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of

230
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:19,250
growing population. We're seven billion people today

231
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,450
heading towards at least nine,

232
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,242
probably nine and a half before we're done.

233
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:26,619
More importantly, changing diets.

234
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:29,666
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,

235
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,733
we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,

236
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,194
which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.

237
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:40,116
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,

238
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:43,317
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,

239
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,790
where we have to replace oil with other energy sources

240
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,361
that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels

241
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,140
and bio-energy sources.

242
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,893
So you put these together. It's really hard to see

243
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,245
how we're going to get to the rest of the century

244
00:10:56,245 --> 00:11:00,573
without at least doubling global agricultural production.

245
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,522
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to

246
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:05,315
double global ag production around the world?

247
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:08,003
Well, we could try to farm more land.

248
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,802
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where

249
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,296
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be

250
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:17,244
based on soils and climate, assuming climate change

251
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,085
doesn't disrupt too much of this,

252
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,973
which is not a good assumption.

253
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,162
We could farm more land, but the problem is

254
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:26,143
the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.

255
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,181
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,

256
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:30,615
things we want to protect.

257
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,439
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,

258
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,757
but we'd better not,

259
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:38,423
because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.

260
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:40,807
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint

261
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:44,592
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.

262
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,992
This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places

263
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:49,559
in the world where we could improve yields

264
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,825
without harming the environment.

265
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:54,226
The green areas here show where corn yields,

266
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,376
just showing corn as an example,

267
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:58,977
are already really high, probably the maximum you could

268
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,855
find on Earth today for that climate and soil,

269
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,206
but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where

270
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,720
we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield

271
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,060
you should be able to get.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,378
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,

273
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:13,238
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union

274
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,479
and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,

275
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,703
is still a mess agriculturally.

276
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,336
Now, this would require nutrients and water.

277
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,469
It's going to either be organic or conventional

278
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,282
or some mix of the two to deliver that.

279
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:26,447
Plants need water and nutrients.

280
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:29,655
But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.

281
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,935
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive

282
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,544
to meeting the food security needs of the future

283
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,807
and the environmental security needs of the future.

284
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,821
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between

285
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,530
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.

286
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,060
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.

287
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,022
We can grow food in the background --

288
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,483
that's a soybean field â

289
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,610
and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,

290
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,128
but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing

291
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:59,125
a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.

292
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,133
In the foreground, we have this prairie

293
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,691
that's wonderful from the environmental side,

294
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,895
but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?

295
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:08,432
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together

296
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:12,542
into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.

297
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,753
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,

298
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,985
"Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food,

299
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:22,733
local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --

300
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,500
and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,

301
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,573
but not any one of these is a silver bullet.

302
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,533
In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.

303
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,045
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together

304
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,363
and you've got something really powerful,

305
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,763
but we need to put them together.

306
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:41,296
So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind

307
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:43,980
of agriculture that blends the best ideas

308
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,085
of commercial agriculture and the green revolution

309
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:50,637
with the best ideas of organic farming and local food

310
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:54,045
and the best ideas of environmental conservation,

311
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,850
not to have them fighting each other but to have them

312
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,599
collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,

313
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:04,317
something I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.

314
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:07,301
Now, having this conversation has been really hard,

315
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:09,413
and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points

316
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,716
to people to reduce the controversy,

317
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,216
to increase the collaboration.

318
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:15,763
I want to show you a short video that does kind of show

319
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,093
our efforts right now to bring these sides together

320
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:21,819
into a single conversation. So let me show you that.

321
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,480
(Music)

322
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,137
("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")

323
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:30,578
(Music)

324
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,226
("The world population is growing

325
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:35,239
by 75 million people each year.

326
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,672
That's almost the size of Germany.

327
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:40,615
Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.

328
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:43,305
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.

329
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,073
And we all need food.

330
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:46,424
But how?

331
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:49,312
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?

332
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:52,557
We already know climate change is a big problem.

333
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,807
But it's not the only problem.

334
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,729
We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'

335
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,277
A global crisis in agriculture.

336
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:05,536
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.

337
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,985
More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.

338
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,991
Global croplands cover 16 million kmÂ².

339
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:14,184
That's almost the size of South America.

340
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,979
Global pastures cover 30 million kmÂ².

341
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:18,054
That's the size of Africa.

342
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:22,770
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.

343
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,482
Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.

344
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:30,856
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.

345
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:34,638
That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.

346
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:37,619
Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.

347
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,643
Some dry up altogether.

348
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:43,627
Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.

349
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:47,250
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.

350
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,133
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.

351
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,389
The consequence?

352
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,373
Widespread water pollution

353
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,535
and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.

354
00:15:56,535 --> 00:16:00,909
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

355
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,336
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

356
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:06,029
That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,

357
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,005
or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.

358
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,373
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,

359
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:12,749
methane from animals and rice fields,

360
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,581
and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.

361
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:17,836
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.

362
00:16:17,836 --> 00:16:21,367
And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.

363
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,873
Here's the dilemma...

364
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:27,228
As the world grows by several billion more people,

365
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:31,812
We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.

366
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,208
So where do we go from here?

367
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,011
We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.

368
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:37,819
We need to invest in real solutions:

369
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,157
incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,

370
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:45,818
gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.

371
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:48,024
We need everyone at the table.

372
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,974
Advocates of commercial agriculture,

373
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,121
environmental conservation,

374
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,582
and organic farming...

375
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,617
must work together.

376
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,175
There is no single solution.

377
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,800
We need collaboration,

378
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,236
imagination,

379
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,014
determination,

380
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:03,673
because failure is not an option.

381
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:07,370
How do we feed the world without destroying it?

382
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,236
Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges

383
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,346
in all of human history today:

384
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,020
the need to feed nine billion people

385
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,774
and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,

386
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:20,475
at the same time protecting our planet

387
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:23,288
for this and future generations.

388
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,804
This is going to be one of the hardest things

389
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:26,675
we ever have done in human history,

390
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:29,925
and we absolutely have to get it right,

391
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:34,262
and we have to get it right on our first and only try.

392
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,237
So thanks very much. (Applause)
