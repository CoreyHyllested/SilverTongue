0
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,616
In the year 1901,

1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,120
a woman called Auguste was taken
to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,496
Auguste was delusional

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,520
and couldn't remember
even the most basic details of her life.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,400
Her doctor was called Alois.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,096
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,640
but he watched over her until,
sadly, she passed away in 1906.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,256
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,496
and found strange plaques
and tangles in Auguste's brain --

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,856
the likes of which he'd never seen before.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,040
Now here's the even more striking thing.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
If Auguste had instead been alive today,

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,280
we could offer her no more help
than Alois was able to 114 years ago.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,640
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,656
And Auguste Deter

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,920
was the first patient to be diagnosed with
what we now call Alzheimer's disease.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,136
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
to protect us from infections,

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,016
many treatments for cancer,
antiretrovirals for HIV,

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,520
statins for heart disease and much more.

20
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:29,761
But we've made essentially no progress
at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,976
I'm part of a team of scientists

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,286
who has been working to find
a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,256
So I think about this all the time.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,880
Alzheimer's now affects
40 million people worldwide.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,560
But by 2050, it will affect
150 million people --

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,520
which, by the way,
will include many of you.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
If you're hoping
to live to be 85 or older,

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,840
your chance of getting Alzheimer's
will be almost one in two.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,816
In other words, odds are
you'll spend your golden years

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,056
either suffering from Alzheimer's

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
or helping to look after a friend
or loved one with Alzheimer's.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,456
Already in the United States alone,

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,759
Alzheimer's care costs
200 billion dollars every year.

34
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,920
One out of every five
Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,816
It is today the most expensive disease,

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,056
and costs are projected
to increase fivefold by 2050,

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,240
as the baby boomer generation ages.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,376
It may surprise you that, put simply,

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
and social challenges of our generation.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,040
But we've done relatively
little to address it.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,480
Today, of the top 10
causes of death worldwide,

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,520
Alzheimer's is the only one
we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
We understand less about the science
of Alzheimer's than other diseases

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,600
because we've invested less time
and money into researching it.

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,376
The US government
spends 10 times more every year

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,376
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
despite the fact
that Alzheimer's costs us more

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,720
and causes a similar number
of deaths each year as cancer.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,616
The lack of resources
stems from a more fundamental cause:

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
a lack of awareness.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Because here's what few people know
but everyone should:

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,640
Alzheimer's is a disease,
and we can cure it.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,856
For most of the past 114 years,

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,336
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
confused Alzheimer's with aging.

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,837
We thought that becoming senile

56
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,100
was a normal and inevitable
part of getting old.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,016
But we only have to look at a picture

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,896
of a healthy aged brain compared
to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,960
to see the real physical damage
caused by this disease.

60
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,816
As well as triggering severe loss
of memory and mental abilities,

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,056
the damage to the brain
caused by Alzheimer's

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,840
significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.

63
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,536
Remember Dr. Alzheimer
found strange plaques and tangles

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
in Auguste's brain a century ago.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,280
For almost a century,
we didn't know much about these.

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Today we know they're made
from protein molecules.

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,296
You can imagine a protein molecule

68
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,360
as a piece of paper that normally folds
into an elaborate piece of origami.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,256
There are spots
on the paper that are sticky.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,536
And when it folds correctly,
these sticky bits end up on the inside.

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,016
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,056
This causes the protein molecules
to stick to each other,

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,760
forming clumps that eventually become
large plaques and tangles.

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
That's what we see
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,336
We've spent the past 10 years
at the University of Cambridge

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,080
trying to understand
how this malfunction works.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,496
There are many steps, and identifying
which step to try to block is complex --

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
like defusing a bomb.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,696
Cutting one wire might do nothing.

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Cutting others might
make the bomb explore.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,336
We have to find the right step to block,

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,480
and then create a drug that does it.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,056
Until recently, we for the most part

84
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,536
have been cutting wires
and hoping for the best.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,416
But now we've got together
a diverse group of people --

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,016
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
physicists, engineers and mathematicians.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,256
And together, we've managed
to identify a critical step in the process

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,496
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
and stop the disease.

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,856
Now let me show you
some of our latest results.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,536
No one outside of our lab
has seen these yet.

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,536
Let's look at some videos of what happened
when we tested these new drugs in worms.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,416
So these are healthy worms,

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,640
and you can see
they're moving around normally.

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,000
These worms, on the other hand,

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,576
have protein molecules
sticking together inside them --

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,216
like humans with Alzheimer's.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,536
And you can see they're clearly sick.

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,536
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
then we see that they're healthy,
and they live a normal lifespan.

101
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,856
This is just an initial positive result,
but research like this

102
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,616
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
that we can understand and we can cure.

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,536
After 114 years of waiting,

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,936
there's finally real hope
for what can be achieved

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,680
in the next 10 or 20 years.

106
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,360
But to grow that hope,
to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,776
This isn't about scientists like me --

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
it's about you.

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,176
We need you to raise awareness
that Alzheimer's is a disease

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,816
and that if we try, we can beat it.

111
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,656
In the case of other diseases,

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,816
patients and their families
have led the charge for more research

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,776
and put pressure on governments,
the pharmaceutical industry,

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,016
scientists and regulators.

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,896
That was essential for advancing treatment
for HIV in the late 1980s.

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,600
Today, we see that same drive
to beat cancer.

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,656
But Alzheimer's patients are often
unable to speak up for themselves.

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,416
And their families, the hidden victims,
caring for their loved ones night and day,

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,480
are often too worn out
to go out and advocate for change.

120
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,400
So, it really is down to you.

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,056
Alzheimer's isn't,
for the most part, a genetic disease.

122
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,200
Everyone with a brain is at risk.

123
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,656
Today, there are 40 million
patients like Auguste,

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,576
who can't create the change
they need for themselves.

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
Help speak up for them,

126
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,280
and help demand a cure.

127
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:48,496
Thank you.

128
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,120
(Applause)
