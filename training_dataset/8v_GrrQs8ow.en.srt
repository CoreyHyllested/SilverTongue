00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,022
There's a big question
at the center of life

1
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,960
in our democracies today:

2
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,329
How do we fight terror
without destroying democracies,

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,876
without trampling human rights?

4
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:28,189
I've spent much of my career
working with journalists,

5
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:29,371
with bloggers,

6
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,709
with activists,

7
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,348
with human rights researchers
all around the world,

8
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,482
and I've come to the conclusion

9
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:40,151
that if our democratic societies
do not double down

10
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,158
on protecting and defending human rights,

11
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,582
freedom of the press

12
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:47,022
and a free and open internet,

13
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:53,793
radical extremist ideologies
are much more likely to persist.

14
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,982
(Applause)

15
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,690
OK, all done. Thank you very much.

16
00:00:58,714 --> 00:00:59,873
No, just joking.

17
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,306
(Laughter)

18
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,609
I actually want to drill down
on this a little bit.

19
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:10,712
So, one of the countries that has been
on the frontlines of this issue

20
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:11,966
is Tunisia,

21
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,841
which was the only country
to come out of the Arab Spring

22
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:18,463
with a successful democratic revolution.

23
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,232
Five years later,

24
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:23,092
they're struggling
with serious terror attacks

25
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,829
and rampant ISIS recruitment.

26
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,637
And many Tunisians
are calling on their government

27
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:31,721
to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

28
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,714
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari

29
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:40,013
has summed up the situation
with this character who says,

30
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:42,616
"I don't give a damn about human rights.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,491
I don't give a damn about the revolution.

32
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,971
I don't give a damn
about democracy and liberty.

33
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,177
I just want to be safe."

34
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,014
"Satisfied?" asked his jailer.

35
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,205
"You're safe now."

36
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,696
If the Tunisian people can figure out

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,783
how to deal with their terrorism problem

38
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,229
without ending up in this place,

39
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:09,454
they will be a model
not only for their region,

40
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:10,846
but for all of us.

41
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:16,438
The reality is that civil society,
journalists and activists

42
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:21,291
are coming under attack
from extremist groups on the one hand,

43
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,045
and, in many countries,

44
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,504
also from their own governments.

45
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,920
We're seeing bloggers
and journalists being jailed,

46
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:30,382
charged and intimidated

47
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,924
by their own governments,

48
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,343
many of which are allies
with the West in the war on terror.

49
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:37,422
Just three examples.

50
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,302
A friend and former colleague of mine,

51
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,558
Hisham Almiraat,

52
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:43,626
has been charged
with threatening state security,

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,599
along with six other activists in Morocco.

54
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:51,617
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi
has been jailed and flogged

55
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:57,413
for insulting Islam and criticizing
the Saudi regime on his blog.

56
00:02:57,437 --> 00:03:02,927
More recently, the Turkish representative
for Reporters Without Borders,

57
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,798
Erol Ã–nderoglu,

58
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:09,566
has been detained and charged
with spreading terrorist propaganda,

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,052
because he and some other activists
have been supporting Kurdish media.

60
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,712
Anti-terror measures
quickly turn into state repression

61
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,812
without strong protection
for minority communities

62
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,338
and for peaceful debate;

63
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,725
this needs to be supported
by a robust, independent local media.

64
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,053
But while that's not really happening,

65
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:36,068
Washington is teaming up
with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood

66
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:41,077
to pour millions -- hundreds
of millions of dollars --

67
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:43,688
into what's called "counter-messaging,"

68
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,691
a fancy word for propaganda.

69
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:52,033
To counter the terrorist propaganda
spreading all over the internet,

70
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:56,360
in Europe, Internet Referral
Units are being set up,

71
00:03:56,384 --> 00:04:00,361
so that people can report
on extremist content that they find

72
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:01,792
and get it censored.

73
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,551
The problem is,

74
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:08,180
that all of this propaganda,
monitoring and censorship

75
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:12,787
completely fails to make up for the fact

76
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:18,310
that the people who are
the most credible voices,

77
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:22,419
who can present credible ideas
and alternative solutions

78
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:26,544
to real economic, social and political
problems in their community

79
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,851
that are causing people to turn
to extremism in the first place,

80
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,691
are being silenced
by their own governments.

81
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:38,776
This is all adding up to a decrease
in freedom across the world.

82
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:40,977
Freedom House,

83
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,031
the human rights organization,

84
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:47,391
reports that 2015 marks
the 10th straight year in a row

85
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:50,471
of decline in freedom worldwide.

86
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,891
And this is not just
because of the actions

87
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,946
of authoritarian governments.

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,467
It's also because democratic governments

89
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:01,794
are increasingly cracking
down on dissenters,

90
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:02,986
whistle-blowers

91
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,923
and investigative journalists.

92
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:07,381
UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-Moon has warned

93
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,842
that "preventing extremism and promoting
human rights go hand-in-hand."

94
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,670
It's not to say that governments
shouldn't keep us safe --

95
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,845
of course they should --

96
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:18,464
but we need public oversight, transparency

97
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,729
and accountability to the rule of law.

98
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,905
Meanwhile,

99
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,802
extremists are literally killing off
civil society in some countries.

100
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:28,732
Since 2013 in Bangladesh,

101
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:33,272
over a dozen secular bloggers
and community activists

102
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,229
have been literally
slaughtered by extremists

103
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,597
while the government has done very little.

104
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,955
From the city of Raqqa in Syria,

105
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,555
people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf
have been assassinated

106
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,594
for their reporting
out of ISIS-controlled territory.

107
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:55,899
The citizen media group called
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently

108
00:05:55,923 --> 00:06:00,142
relies on strong encryption
to send out their reports

109
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,578
and shield themselves
from interception and surveillance.

110
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:06,807
Yet authorities in countries
like the United States,

111
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,374
the United Kingdom
and many other democracies

112
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:11,251
are seeking to use the law

113
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:15,732
to either weaken or outright ban
strong encryption,

114
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,936
because the bad guys are using it, too.

115
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:22,725
We have got to fight for the right
of citizens to use strong encryption.

116
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,379
Otherwise, dissent
and investigative journalism

117
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,802
are going to become even more difficult

118
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,290
in even more places.

119
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,125
And the bad guys -- the criminals
and terrorists --

120
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,409
are still going to find
ways to communicate.

121
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,072
Kudos to the companies
that are standing up

122
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,550
for their users' right to use encryption.

123
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,861
But when it comes to censorship,

124
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,196
the picture is much more troubling.

125
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,428
Yes, there's a real problem

126
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:51,715
of extremist content
spreading all over the internet.

127
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:55,272
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter
are among the many companies

128
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:59,723
who report having taken down hundreds
of thousands of pieces of content

129
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:01,327
and deactivating accounts

130
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:03,831
that are connected
to the extremist's speech.

131
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:08,175
The problem is their enforcement
mechanisms are a complete black box,

132
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,187
and there is collateral damage.

133
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,929
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,

134
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,152
an activist who makes fun
of ISIS on Twitter.

135
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,992
He had his account deactivated,

136
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:21,541
because he shares a surname
with a prominent ISIS leader.

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,371
Last December,

138
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,014
a number of women named Isis,

139
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,490
which also happens to be
the name of an Egyptian goddess,

140
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,397
had their accounts deactivated.

141
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,358
And this woman,

142
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:35,487
who lives in the United States
and is a computer programmer,

143
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:39,237
reported on Twitter
about her deactivation on Facebook,

144
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:42,954
managed to get enough media attention
to have her account reinstated.

145
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,666
But that's the thing --
she had to get media attention.

146
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,529
And journalists aren't immune.

147
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,727
David Thomson,

148
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:52,149
an expert on terrorism and reporter
for Radio France International,

149
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,736
had reports deleted
from his Facebook account

150
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,549
and had his account
deactivated for several days,

151
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,474
because they contained
pictures of ISIS flags,

152
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,554
even though he was just reporting on ISIS,

153
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,756
not promoting it.

154
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,242
And then we have stories from people
like this Egyptian man,

155
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,883
Ahmed Abdellahy,

156
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:16,050
who reported recently in an event
in Washington DC

157
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,248
that some of his arguments
with extremists --

158
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:24,585
he now spends his time on social media
arguing with ISIS followers,

159
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,616
trying to get them to turn away --

160
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:32,136
some of his arguments
with these extremists get deleted,

161
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,207
which he believes has the effect
of shielding them

162
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,118
from alternative points of view.

163
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:42,602
It's unclear whether Facebook
even knows the extent

164
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,138
of the collateral damage,

165
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,994
or the other companies as well.

166
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:50,172
But we do know that journalism,
activism and public debate

167
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,316
are being silenced in the effort
to stamp out extremist speech.

168
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:59,639
So with these companies having so much
power over the public discourse,

169
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,257
they need to be held accountable.

170
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:04,162
They need to carry out impact assessment

171
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:08,703
to identify and fix the problems
that we're clearly seeing.

172
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:12,503
They need to be more transparent
about their enforcement mechanisms,

173
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:15,929
and they need to have clear
appeal and grievance mechanisms,

174
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,297
so people can get
their content reinstated.

175
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,833
Now, I've been talking
for the last 10 minutes

176
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:25,972
about how governments and companies
are making it more difficult

177
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:27,332
for people like these.

178
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:30,839
This is a picture of members
of the citizen media network,

179
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,014
Global Voices,

180
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,131
that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago

181
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:36,151
with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.

182
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:40,645
Interestingly, about 5 years ago,
right after the Arab Spring,

183
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:43,326
the data scientist Gilad Lotan

184
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,267
created a network map
of the people in Global Voices

185
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,213
who were heavy users of Twitter
during the Arab Spring.

186
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:56,455
And he found that many of these people
served as key information nodes

187
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,343
between activists and journalists

188
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,392
throughout the Tunisian
and Egyptian revolution.

189
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:06,127
We've got to make sure
that these people not only survive,

190
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,192
but are able to continue to thrive.

191
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,870
Many of them are still active,

192
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,970
other than the ones who have gone to jail

193
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,913
or have been driven into hiding or exile.

194
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,024
All around the world,

195
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,827
people who are sick and tired
of fear and oppression

196
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:25,301
are linking up in their communities
and across borders.

197
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:29,588
We've got to do everything we can
to push our governments and companies

198
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:32,548
to do a better job
of protecting their rights.

199
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,557
We've also got to be more mindful

200
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:39,426
about how our own personal, political,
consumer and business choices

201
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,119
affect people like these around the world.

202
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:45,544
Also, if you follow the news,

203
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,836
it's pretty clear that that alone
isn't going to be enough.

204
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:53,454
We've got to take personal
responsibility by joining --

205
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,336
or at very least, actively supporting --

206
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,440
the growing ecosystem
of individuals and groups

207
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,550
who are fighting for social justice,

208
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,637
environmental sustainability,

209
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,224
government accountability,

210
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,125
human rights, freedom of the press

211
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,705
and a free and open internet,

212
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,485
all around the world.

213
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:16,220
I believe that, ultimately,
we can overcome

214
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:22,702
the digitally empowered networks
of extremism, demagoguery and hate.

215
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,559
But ...

216
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:31,828
we've got to do this by really
beefing up the global networks

217
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:33,640
of citizens around the world,

218
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:37,444
powered by people
who are working hard every day,

219
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,233
and taking personal risk

220
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:45,164
for a future world that is more
peaceful, just, open and free.

221
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,070
Thanks very much for listening.

222
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:55,611
(Applause)
