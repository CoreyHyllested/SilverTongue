0
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:14,905
I used to have this recurring dream

1
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,341
where I'd walk into a roomful of people,

2
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,960
and I'd try not to make
eye contact with anyone.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,935
Until someone notices me,

4
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:25,402
and I just panic.

5
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,017
And the person walks up to me,

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,550
and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.

7
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,933
And what is your name?"

8
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:35,498
And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.

9
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,639
After some awkward silence, he goes,

10
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,244
"Have you forgotten your name?"

11
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:43,300
And I'm still quiet.

12
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:48,939
And then, slowly, all the other people
in the room begin to turn toward me

13
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,218
and ask, almost in unison,

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,592
(Voice-over, several voices)
"Have you forgotten your name?"

15
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:59,706
As the chant gets louder,
I want to respond, but I don't.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,849
I'm a visual artist.

17
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:07,335
Some of my work is humorous,

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,960
and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,867
And one thing that I really enjoy doing

20
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,157
is making these little animations

21
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,955
where I get to do the voice-over
for all kinds of characters.

22
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,237
I've been a bear.

23
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,330
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.

24
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,105
(Laughter)

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,789
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.

26
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,502
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.

27
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,789
(Laughter)

28
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,277
SS: I've been a greeting card.

29
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,354
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.

30
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,457
(Laughter)

31
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,488
SS: And my personal favorite
is Frankenstein's monster.

32
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:43,209
(Video) Frankenstein's monster
(SS's voice): (Grunts)

33
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,273
(Laughter)

34
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,397
SS: I just had to grunt
a lot for that one.

35
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,104
A few years ago,
I made this educational video

36
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:52,024
about the history of video games.

37
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:55,790
And for that one, I got to do
the voice of Space Invader.

38
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,870
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.

39
00:01:57,894 --> 00:01:59,341
SS: A dream come true, really,

40
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:00,367
(Laughter)

41
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:02,470
And when that video was posted online,

42
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,184
I just sat there on the computer,
hitting "refresh,"

43
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,684
excited to see the response.

44
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,622
The first comment comes in.

45
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:09,940
(Video) Comment: Great job.

46
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,114
SS: Yes!

47
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:12,964
I hit "refresh."

48
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:16,091
(Video) Comment: Excellent video.
I look forward to the next one.

49
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,611
SS: This was just the first
of a two-part video.

50
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,676
I was going to work
on the second one next.

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,866
I hit "refresh."

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,726
(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO?
WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P

53
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,268
(Laughter)

54
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:30,235
SS: People other than my mom
were saying nice things about me,

55
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,425
on the Internet!

56
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,782
It felt like I had finally arrived.

57
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,108
I hit "refresh."

58
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:37,831
(Video) Comment: His voice
is annoying. No offense.

59
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,525
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.

60
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:44,113
(Video) Comment: Could you remake this
without peanut butter in your mouth?

61
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:48,604
SS: OK, at least the feedback
is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."

62
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,174
(Video) Comment: Please don't use
this narrator again

63
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,560
u can barely understand him.

64
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:53,735
SS: Refresh.

65
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,739
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow
because of the Indian accent.

66
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,247
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.

67
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:00,343
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,

68
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,294
I have a Pakistani accent, OK?

69
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,458
And number two, I clearly
have a Pakistani accent.

70
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,503
(Laughter)

71
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,258
But comments like that kept coming in,

72
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:13,027
so I figured I should just ignore them

73
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,640
and start working
on the second part of the video.

74
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,634
I recorded my audio,

75
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,657
but every time I sat down to edit,

76
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,354
I just could not do it.

77
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,676
Every single time, it would take me
back to my childhood,

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,521
when I had a much harder time speaking.

79
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,738
I've stuttered for as long
as I can remember.

80
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,562
I was the kid in class

81
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,223
who would never raise his hand
when he had a question --

82
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,421
or knew the answer.

83
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:40,760
Every time the phone rang,

84
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,419
I would run to the bathroom
so I would not have to answer it.

85
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:48,116
If it was for me, my parents
would say I'm not around.

86
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,070
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

87
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,192
And I hated introducing myself,

88
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,825
especially in groups.

89
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,225
I'd always stutter on my name,
and there was usually someone who'd go,

90
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,776
"Have you forgotten your name?"

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,377
And then everybody would laugh.

92
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:05,006
That joke never got old.

93
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,310
(Laughter)

94
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:13,442
I spent my childhood
feeling that if I spoke,

95
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:18,621
it would become obvious
that there was something wrong with me,

96
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,142
that I was not normal.

97
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,729
So I mostly stayed quiet.

98
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:27,905
And so you see, eventually for me to even
be able to use my voice in my work

99
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,502
was a huge step for me.

100
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,587
Every time I record audio,

101
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:35,106
I fumble my way through saying
each sentence many, many times,

102
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,764
and then I go back in

103
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:40,370
and pick the ones
where I think I suck the least.

104
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:46,076
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing
is like Photoshop for your voice.

105
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,911
I can slow it down, speed it up,
make it deeper, add an echo.

106
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:53,682
And if I stutter along the way,
and if I stutter along the way,

107
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,325
I just go back in and fix it.

108
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,744
It's magic.

109
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:59,673
SS: Using my highly edited
voice in my work

110
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:03,252
was a way for me
to finally sound normal to myself.

111
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,447
But after the comments on the video,

112
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,929
it no longer made me feel normal.

113
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,270
And so I stopped
using my voice in my work.

114
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:17,750
Since then, I've thought a lot
about what it means to be normal.

115
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,236
And I've come to understand

116
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,639
that "normal" has a lot to do
with expectations.

117
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,836
Let me give you an example.

118
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,190
I came across this story

119
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,480
about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.

120
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,753
Now, Homer mentions
very few colors in his writing.

121
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,255
And even when he does,

122
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,317
he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.

123
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:42,228
For example, the sea
is described as wine red,

124
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:45,799
people's faces are sometimes green
and sheep are purple.

125
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,213
But it's not just Homer.

126
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:50,546
If you look at all
of the ancient literature --

127
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,770
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian

128
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,471
and even the original Hebrew Bible --

129
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:58,071
they all mention very few colors.

130
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:02,125
And the most popular theory
for why that might be the case

131
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,553
is that cultures begin
to recognize a color

132
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,662
only once they have the ability
to make that color.

133
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:09,536
So basically, if you can make a color,

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,186
only then can you see it.

135
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:15,386
A color like red, which was fairly easy
for many cultures to make --

136
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,241
they began to see that color
fairly early on.

137
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:21,008
But a color like blue,
which was much harder to make --

138
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:23,785
many cultures didn't begin to learn
how to make that color

139
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:24,975
until much later.

140
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,515
They didn't begin to see it
until much later as well.

141
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,189
So until then, even though
a color might be all around them,

142
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,658
they simply did not have
the ability to see it.

143
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,840
It was invisIble.

144
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:37,244
It was not a part of their normal.

145
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:41,495
And that story has helped
put my own experience into context.

146
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,846
So when I first read
the comments on the video,

147
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,765
my initial reaction was to take it
all very personally.

148
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,441
But the people commenting did not know

149
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,325
how self-conscious I am about my voice.

150
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:56,905
They were mostly reacting to my accent,

151
00:06:56,929 --> 00:07:00,446
that it is not normal
for a narrator to have an accent.

152
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,592
But what is normal, anyway?

153
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,835
We know that reviewers will find
more spelling errors in your writing

154
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,230
if they think you're black.

155
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:13,436
We know that professors are less likely
to help female or minority students.

156
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,996
And we know that resumes
with white-sounding names

157
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,913
get more callbacks than resumes
with black-sounding names.

158
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,241
Why is that?

159
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,454
Because of our expectations
of what is normal.

160
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,714
We think it is normal

161
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,843
when a black student has spelling errors.

162
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,979
We think it is normal

163
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:35,195
when a female or minority student
does not succeed.

164
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:37,601
And we think it is normal

165
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,711
that a white employee
is a better hire than a black employee.

166
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,993
But studies also show
that discrimination of this kind,

167
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,062
in most cases, is simply favoritism,

168
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,604
and it results more from wanting
to help people that you can relate to

169
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:53,690
than the desire to harm people
that you can't relate to.

170
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:58,151
And not relating to people
starts at a very early age.

171
00:07:58,175 --> 00:07:59,555
Let me give you an example.

172
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,498
One library that keeps track of characters

173
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:06,815
in the children's book
collection every year,

174
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,120
found that in 2014,
only about 11 percent of the books

175
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:14,344
had a character of color.

176
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,045
And just the year before,
that number was about eight percent,

177
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,877
even though half of American children
today come from a minority background.

178
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,051
Half.

179
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,977
So there are two big issues here.

180
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,658
Number one, children are told
that they can be anything,

181
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,833
they can do anything,

182
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:31,330
and yet, most stories
that children of color consume

183
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,232
are about people who are not like them.

184
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,015
Number two is that majority groups
don't get to realize

185
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,072
the great extent to which
they are similar to minorities --

186
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:42,143
our everyday experiences, our hopes,

187
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,039
our dreams, our fears

188
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,836
and our mutual love for hummus.

189
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,169
It's delicious!

190
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,900
(Laughter)

191
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,594
Just like the color blue
for Ancient Greeks,

192
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,939
minorities are not a part
of what we consider normal,

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,401
because normal is simply a construction
of what we've been exposed to,

194
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,214
and how visible it is around us.

195
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,722
And this is where things
get a bit difficult.

196
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,994
I can accept the preexisting notion
of normal -- that normal is good,

197
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:17,033
and anything outside of that very
narrow definition of normal is bad.

198
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:21,604
Or I can challenge
that preexisting notion of normal

199
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,635
with my work

200
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,310
and with my voice

201
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:27,761
and with my accent

202
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:30,148
and by standing here onstage,

203
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:33,495
even though I'm scared shitless
and would rather be in the bathroom.

204
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,836
(Laughter)

205
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,677
(Applause)

206
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,472
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice):
I'm now slowly starting to use my voice

207
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:49,650
in my work again.

208
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,825
And it feels good.

209
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,817
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown

210
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,308
the next time a couple dozen
people say that I talk

211
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,640
(Mumbling) like I have peanut
butter in my mouth.

212
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,666
(Laughter)

213
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,370
SS: It just means I now have
a much better understanding

214
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,138
of what's at stake,

215
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:05,662
and how giving up is not an option.

216
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,405
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up
one day and realize

217
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:12,754
that the sky was blue.

218
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,635
It took centuries, even, for humans
to realize what we had been ignoring

219
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,828
for so long.

220
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:22,714
And so we must continuously challenge
our notion of normal,

221
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:27,070
because doing so is going
to allow us as a society

222
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,630
to finally see the sky for what it is.

223
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:38,036
(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

224
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,651
Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)

225
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:40,686
(Laughter)

226
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,861
SS: Thank you.

227
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:45,768
(Applause)
