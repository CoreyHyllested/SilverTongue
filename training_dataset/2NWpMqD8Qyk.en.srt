0
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,056
I believe that the secret to producing
extremely drought-tolerant crops,

1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,296
which should go some way
to providing food security in the world,

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,016
lies in resurrection plants,

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,176
pictured here, in an extremely
droughted state.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,056
You might think
that these plants look dead,

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,376
but they're not.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,856
Give them water,

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,320
and they will resurrect, green up,
start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,616
Now, why would I suggest

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,080
that producing drought-tolerant crops
will go towards providing food security?

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,936
Well, the current world population
is around 7 billion.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,456
And it's estimated that by 2050,

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,176
we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,080
with the bulk of this growth
happening in Africa.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,336
The food and agricultural
organizations of the world

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,496
have suggested that we need
a 70 percent increase

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,696
in current agricultural practice

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,960
to meet that demand.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,416
Given that plants
are at the base of the food chain,

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,760
most of that's going
to have to come from plants.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,056
That percentage of 70 percent

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,296
does not take into consideration
the potential effects of climate change.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,560
This is taken from a study by Dai
published in 2011,

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,176
where he took into consideration

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,576
all the potential effects
of climate change

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,736
and expressed them --
amongst other things --

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,376
increased aridity due to lack of rain
or infrequent rain.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,176
The areas in red shown here,

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,256
are areas that until recently

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,456
have been very successfully
used for agriculture,

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,880
but cannot anymore
because of lack of rainfall.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,560
This is the situation
that's predicted to happen in 2050.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,016
Much of Africa,
in fact, much of the world,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,936
is going to be in trouble.

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,616
We're going to have to think of some
very smart ways of producing food.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,936
And preferably among them,
some drought-tolerant crops.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,016
The other thing
to remember about Africa is

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,840
that most of their agriculture is rainfed.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,536
Now, making drought-tolerant crops
is not the easiest thing in the world.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,976
And the reason for this is water.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,136
Water is essential to life on this planet.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,295
All living, actively
metabolizing organisms,

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,376
from microbes to you and I,

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,736
are comprised predominately of water.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,296
All life reactions happen in water.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,336
And loss of a small amount
of water results in death.

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,416
You and I are 65 percent water --

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,160
we lose one percent of that, we die.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,560
But we can make behavioral
changes to avoid that.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,496
Plants can't.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,136
They're stuck in the ground.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,536
And so in the first instance they have
a little bit more water than us,

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,816
about 95 percent water,

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,936
and they can lose
a little bit more than us,

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,920
like 10 to about 70 percent,
depending on the species,

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
but for short periods only.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,856
Most of them will either try
to resist or avoid water loss.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,816
So extreme examples of resistors
can be found in succulents.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,656
They tend to be small, very attractive,

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,416
but they hold onto their water
at such great cost

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
that they grow extremely slowly.

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,016
Examples of avoidance of water loss
are found in trees and shrubs.

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,616
They send down very deep roots,

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,336
mine subterranean water supplies

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,816
and just keep flushing
it through them at all times,

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,696
keeping themselves hydrated.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,696
The one on the right is called a baobab.

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,776
It's also called the upside-down tree,

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,576
simply because the proportion
of roots to shoots is so great

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,296
that it looks like the tree
has been planted upside down.

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,560
And of course the roots are required
for hydration of that plant.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,280
And probably the most common strategy
of avoidance is found in annuals.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,016
Annuals make up the bulk
of our plant food supplies.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,736
Up the west coast of my country,

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,296
for much of the year
you don't see much vegetation growth.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,976
But come the spring rains, you get this:

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
flowering of the desert.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,856
The strategy in annuals,

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,240
is to grow only in the rainy season.

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,256
At the end of that season
they produce a seed,

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,096
which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,776
but very much alive.

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,696
And anything that is
that dry and still alive,

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,200
we call desiccation-tolerant.

84
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,256
In the desiccated state,

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,936
what seeds can do
is lie in extremes of environment

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,616
for prolonged periods of time.

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,856
The next time the rainy season comes,

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,376
they germinate and grow,

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
and the whole cycle just starts again.

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,176
It's widely believed that the evolution
of desiccation-tolerant seeds

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,376
allowed the colonization and the radiation

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,920
of flowering plants,
or angiosperms, onto land.

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,120
But back to annuals
as our major form of food supplies.

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent
of our plant food supplies.

95
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,016
And it's been a great strategy

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,216
because in a short space of time
you can produce a lot of seed.

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,860
Seeds are energy-rich
so there's a lot of food calories,

98
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:59,804
you can store it in times of plenty
for times of famine,

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,720
but there's a downside.

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,936
The vegetative tissues,

101
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,136
the roots and leaves of annuals,

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,416
do not have much

103
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,536
by way of inherent resistance,
avoidance or tolerance characteristics.

104
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,856
They just don't need them.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,296
They grow in the rainy season

106
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,696
and they've got a seed
to help them survive the rest of the year.

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,416
And so despite concerted
efforts in agriculture

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,976
to make crops with improved properties

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,176
of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,096
particularly resistance and avoidance

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,016
because we've had good models
to understand how those work --

112
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,376
we still get images like this.

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,856
Maize crop in Africa,

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,296
two weeks without rain

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
and it's dead.

116
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
There is a solution:

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,760
resurrection plants.

118
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,096
These plants can lose 95 percent
of their cellular water,

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,976
remain in a dry, dead-like state
for months to years,

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,736
and give them water,

121
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
they green up and start growing again.

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,856
Like seeds, these are
desiccation-tolerant.

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,000
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes
of environmental conditions.

124
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,776
And this is a really rare phenomenon.

125
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,176
There are only 135 flowering
plant species that can do this.

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,616
I'm going to show you a video

127
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,256
of the resurrection process
of these three species

128
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,496
in that order.

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,776
And at the bottom,

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,536
there's a time axis
so you can see how quickly it happens.

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,200
(Applause)

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,776
Pretty amazing, huh?

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,016
So I've spent the last 21 years
trying to understand how they do this.

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,440
How do these plants dry without dying?

135
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,856
And I work on a variety
of different resurrection plants,

136
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,296
shown here in the hydrated and dry states,

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,776
for a number of reasons.

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,656
One of them is that each
of these plants serves as a model

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,056
for a crop that I'd like
to make drought-tolerant.

140
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,016
So on the extreme top left,
for example, is a grass,

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,296
it's called Eragrostis nindensis,

142
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,696
it's got a close relative
called Eragrostis tef --

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,736
a lot of you might know it as "teff" --

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,496
it's a staple food in Ethiopia,

145
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,776
it's gluten-free,

146
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,816
and it's something we would like
to make drought-tolerant.

147
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,256
The other reason for looking
at a number of plants,

148
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,656
is that, at least initially,

149
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,936
I wanted to find out:
do they do the same thing?

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,656
Do they all use the same mechanisms

151
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,256
to be able to lose
all that water and not die?

152
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,976
So I undertook what we call
a systems biology approach

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,176
in order to get
a comprehensive understanding

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,216
of desiccation tolerance,

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,696
in which we look at everything

156
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,632
from the molecular to the whole plant,
ecophysiological level.

157
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:02,291
For example we look at things like

158
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,513
changes in the plant anatomy
as they dried out

159
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,776
and their ultrastructure.

160
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,976
We look at the transcriptome,
which is just a term for a technology

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,416
in which we look at the genes

162
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,856
that are switched on or off,
in response to drying.

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,096
Most genes will code for proteins,
so we look at the proteome.

164
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,520
What are the proteins made
in response to drying?

165
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,376
Some proteins would code for enzymes
which make metabolites,

166
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,976
so we look at the metabolome.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,296
Now, this is important
because plants are stuck in the ground.

168
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,416
They use what I call
a highly tuned chemical arsenal

169
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,856
to protect themselves from all
the stresses of their environment.

170
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,376
So it's important that we look

171
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,840
at the chemical changes
involved in drying.

172
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,176
And at the last study
that we do at the molecular level,

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,456
we look at the lipidome --

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,535
the lipid changes in response to drying.

175
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,816
And that's also important

176
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,655
because all biological membranes
are made of lipids.

177
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,256
They're held as membranes
because they're in water.

178
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,520
Take away the water,
those membranes fall apart.

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Lipids also act as signals
to turn on genes.

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,896
Then we use physiological
and biochemical studies

181
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,136
to try and understand
the function of the putative protectants

182
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,096
that we've actually discovered
in our other studies.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,296
And then use all of that
to try and understand

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,640
how the plant copes
with its natural environment.

185
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,816
I've always had the philosophy that
I needed a comprehensive understanding

186
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,096
of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance

187
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,960
in order to make a meaningful suggestion
for a biotic application.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,656
I'm sure some of you are thinking,

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,936
"By biotic application,

190
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,880
does she mean she's going to make
genetically modified crops?"

191
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,936
And the answer to that question is:

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,341
depends on your definition
of genetic modification.

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,016
All of the crops that we eat today,
wheat, rice and maize,

194
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,256
are highly genetically modified
from their ancestors,

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,256
but we don't consider them GM

196
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
because they're being produced
by conventional breeding.

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,656
If you mean, am I going to put
resurrection plant genes into crops,

198
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,976
your answer is yes.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,136
In the essence of time,
we have tried that approach.

200
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,016
More appropriately,
some of my collaborators at UCT,

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,976
Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,616
have spearheaded that approach

203
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,593
and I'm going to show you some data soon.

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,216
But we're about to embark
upon an extremely ambitious approach,

205
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,696
in which we aim to turn on
whole suites of genes

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,416
that are already present in every crop.

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,345
They're just never turned on
under extreme drought conditions.

208
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,256
I leave it up to you to decide

209
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,233
whether those should be called GM or not.

210
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,016
I'm going to now just give you
some of the data from that first approach.

211
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,296
And in order to do that

212
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,976
I have to explain a little bit
about how genes work.

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,256
So you probably all know

214
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,336
that genes are made
of double-stranded DNA.

215
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,296
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes

216
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,480
that are present in every cell
of your body or in a plant's body.

217
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,160
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.

218
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,296
And each gene has a promoter,

219
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,696
which is just an on-off switch,

220
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,136
the gene coding region,

221
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,416
and then a terminator,

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
which indicates that this is the end
of this gene, the next gene will start.

223
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,616
Now, promoters are not
simple on-off switches.

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,336
They normally require
a lot of fine-tuning,

225
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,400
lots of things to be present and correct
before that gene is switched on.

226
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,296
So what's typically done
in biotech studies

227
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,136
is that we use an inducible promoter,

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,736
we know how to switch it on.

229
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,776
We couple that to genes of interest

230
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,480
and put that into a plant
and see how the plant responds.

231
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,696
In the study that I'm going
to talk to you about,

232
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,176
my collaborators used
a drought-induced promoter,

233
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,616
which we discovered
in a resurrection plant.

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,776
The nice thing about this promoter
is that we do nothing.

235
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
The plant itself senses drought.

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,696
And we've used it to drive antioxidant
genes from resurrection plants.

237
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,576
Why antioxidant genes?

238
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,656
Well, all stresses,
particularly drought stress,

239
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,976
results in the formation of free radicals,

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,336
or reactive oxygen species,

241
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,080
which are highly damaging
and can cause crop death.

242
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,280
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,256
So here's some data from a maize strain
that's very popularly used in Africa.

244
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,576
To the left of the arrow
are plants without the genes,

245
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,856
to the right --

246
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,936
plants with the antioxidant genes.

247
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,776
After three weeks without watering,

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,280
the ones with the genes
do a hell of a lot better.

249
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,056
Now to the final approach.

250
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,616
My research has shown
that there's considerable similarity

251
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,056
in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
in seeds and resurrection plants.

252
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,496
So I ask the question,

253
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,960
are they using the same genes?

254
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,736
Or slightly differently phrased,

255
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,256
are resurrection plants using genes
evolved in seed desiccation tolerance

256
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,536
in their roots and leaves?

257
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,616
Have they retasked these seed genes

258
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,680
in roots and leaves
of resurrection plants?

259
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,616
And I answer that question,

260
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,056
as a consequence of a lot
of research from my group

261
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,616
and recent collaborations from a group
of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,

262
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,216
Mel Oliver in the United States

263
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,840
and Julia Buitink in France.

264
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,296
The answer is yes,

265
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,176
that there is a core set of genes
that are involved in both.

266
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,616
And I'm going to illustrate this
very crudely for maize,

267
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,056
where the chromosomes below the off switch

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,655
represent all the genes that are required
for desiccation tolerance.

269
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,936
So as maize seeds dried out
at the end of their period of development,

270
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
they switch these genes on.

271
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,576
Resurrection plants
switch on the same genes

272
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,256
when they dry out.

273
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,056
All modern crops, therefore,

274
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,136
have these genes
in their roots and leaves,

275
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,896
they just never switch them on.

276
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,880
They only switch them on in seed tissues.

277
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,176
So what we're trying to do right now

278
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,816
is to understand the environmental
and cellular signals

279
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,280
that switch on these genes
in resurrection plants,

280
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
to mimic the process in crops.

281
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,416
And just a final thought.

282
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,656
What we're trying to do very rapidly

283
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,496
is to repeat what nature did
in the evolution of resurrection plants

284
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
some 10 to 40 million years ago.

285
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,656
My plants and I thank you
for your attention.

286
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,915
(Applause)
