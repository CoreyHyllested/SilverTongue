00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:15,721
I want to tell you
about the future of money.

1
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,064
Let's start with a story
about this culture

2
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:23,276
that lived in Micronesia
in the early 1900s, called the Yap.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,083
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap

4
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:27,973
because their form of money
is really interesting.

5
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:31,635
They use these limestone discs
called Rai stones.

6
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,386
Now, the Yap don't actually
move these Rai stones around

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,207
or exchange them the way
we do with our coins,

8
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:41,696
because Rai stones can get
to be pretty massive.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,048
The largest is about four tons
and 12 feet across.

10
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:51,153
So the Yap just keep track
of who owns part of what stone.

11
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,138
There's a story about these sailors

12
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:56,818
that were transporting a stone
across the ocean

13
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,668
when they ran into some trouble
and the stone actually fell in.

14
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,896
The sailors got back to the main island

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,177
and they told everyone what had happened.

16
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,950
And everyone decided that, actually, yes,

17
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:13,348
the sailors had the stone
and -- why not? -- it still counted.

18
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:15,566
Even though it was
at the bottom of the ocean,

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,745
it was still part of the Yap economy.

20
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,742
You might think that this
was just a small culture

21
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,134
a hundred years ago.

22
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:26,306
But things like this happen
in the Western world as well,

23
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,689
and the Yap actually still use
a form of these stones.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,788
In 1932, the Bank of France
asked the United States

25
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:38,376
to convert their holdings
from dollars into gold.

26
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:42,094
But it was too inconvenient
to think about actually shipping

27
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:44,047
all of that gold over to Europe.

28
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,904
So instead, someone went to where
that gold was being stored

29
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:51,982
and they just labeled it
as belonging to France now.

30
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,474
And everyone agreed
that France owned the gold.

31
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:57,825
It's just like those Rai stones.

32
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,838
The point I want to make
with these two examples

33
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,250
is that there's nothing
inherently valuable

34
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,635
about a dollar or a stone or a coin.

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,782
The only reason these things
have any value

36
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:13,374
is because we've all decided they should.

37
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,227
And because we've decided that,

38
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,420
they do.

39
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:21,363
Money is about the exchanges
and the transactions

40
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,448
that we have with each other.

41
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,850
Money isn't anything objective.

42
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:31,271
It's about a collective story
that we tell each other about value.

43
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,482
A collective fiction.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,053
And that's a really powerful concept.

45
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,526
In the past two decades,

46
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,819
we've begun to use digital money.

47
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,516
So I get paid via direct deposit,

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,023
I pay my rent via bank transfer,

49
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,991
I pay my taxes online.

50
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,167
And every month,

51
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,956
a small amount of money
is deducted from my paycheck

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,947
and invested in mutual funds
in my retirement account.

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,629
All of these interactions

54
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:02,711
are literally just changing
1's and 0's on computers.

55
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:07,109
There's not even anything physical,
like a stone or a coin.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,603
Digital money makes it
so that I can pay someone around the world

57
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,008
in seconds.

58
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,492
Now when this works,

59
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:20,361
it's because there are large institutions
underwriting every 1 or 0

60
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,314
that changes on a computer.

61
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:23,503
And when it doesn't,

62
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:25,925
it's often the fault
of those large institutions.

63
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,892
Or at least, it's up to them
to fix the problem.

64
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,476
And a lot of times, they don't.

65
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,031
There's a lot of friction in the system.

66
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:36,813
How long did it take
the US credit card companies

67
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,413
to implement chip and pin?

68
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:42,014
Half my credit cards
still don't work in Europe.

69
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,936
That's friction.

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,472
Transferring money across borders
and across currencies

71
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,140
is really expensive:

72
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,268
friction.

73
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:57,215
An entrepreneur in India
can set up an online business in minutes,

74
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,768
but it's hard for her
to get loans and to get paid:

75
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:02,666
friction.

76
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:08,545
Our access to digital money
and our ability to freely transact

77
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,512
is being held captive
by these gatekeepers.

78
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:15,352
And there's a lot of impediments
in the system slowing things down.

79
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:20,040
That's because digital money
isn't really mine,

80
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:23,638
it's entries in databases
that belong to my bank,

81
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:26,815
my credit card company
or my investment firm.

82
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,203
And these companies
have the right to say "no."

83
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:32,648
If I'm a PayPal merchant

84
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:37,143
and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,

85
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,323
that's it.

86
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:41,634
My account gets frozen,
and I can't get paid.

87
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,837
These institutions are standing
in the way of innovation.

88
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:54,346
How many of you use
Facebook photos, Google Photos,

89
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,953
Instagram?

90
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,323
My photos are everywhere.

91
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,832
They are on my phone,
they're on my laptop,

92
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:03,372
they're on my old phone,
they're in Dropbox.

93
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,228
They're on all these different
websites and services.

94
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,156
And most of these services
don't work together.

95
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,320
They don't inter-operate.

96
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,031
And as a result,

97
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,265
my photo library is a mess.

98
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,211
The same thing happens

99
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:23,194
when institutions control
the money supply.

100
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:26,697
A lot of these services
don't inter-operate,

101
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:30,161
and as a result, this blocks
what we can do with payment.

102
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:32,735
And it makes transaction costs go up.

103
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:37,025
So far, we've been through
two phases of money.

104
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:41,916
In an analog world, we had
to deal with these physical objects,

105
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,819
and money moved at a certain speed --
the speed of humans.

106
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:51,765
In a digital world, money can reach
much farther and is much faster,

107
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,819
but we're at the mercy
of these gatekeeper institutions.

108
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,210
Money only moves at the speed of banks.

109
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,562
We're about to enter a new phase of money.

110
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:05,868
The future of money is programmable.

111
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,461
When we combine software and currency,

112
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:14,262
money becomes more
than just a static unit of value,

113
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:17,476
and we don't have to rely
on institutions for security.

114
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:19,705
In a programmable world,

115
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,663
we remove humans
and institutions from the loop.

116
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,969
And when this happens,

117
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:28,685
we won't even feel like
we're transacting anymore.

118
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,957
Money will be directed by software,

119
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,849
and it will just safely and securely flow.

120
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:39,967
Cryptocurrencies are the first step
of this evolution.

121
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,442
Cryptocurrencies are digital money

122
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:45,334
that isn't run by any government or bank.

123
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:49,419
It's money designed to work
in a world without intermediaries.

124
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:53,186
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous
cryptocurrency,

125
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,907
but there are hundreds of them.

126
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:58,408
There's Ethereum, Litecoin,
Stellar, Dogecoin,

127
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,978
and those are just a few
of the more popular ones.

128
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,009
And these things are real money.

129
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,362
The sushi restaurant down my street

130
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:07,541
takes Bitcoin.

131
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:12,091
I have an app on my phone
that I can use to buy sashimi.

132
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,429
But it's not just for small transactions.

133
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:20,282
In March, there was a transaction
that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.

134
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,711
That's the equivalent
of 40 million US dollars.

135
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,976
Cryptocurrencies are based on
a special field of mathematics

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,383
called cryptography.

137
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:34,794
Cryptography is the study
of how to secure communication,

138
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:37,517
and it's about two
really important things:

139
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,119
masking information so it can
be hidden in plain sight,

140
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:44,370
and verifying a piece
of information's source.

141
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:49,363
Cryptography underpins
so many of the systems around us.

142
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,913
And it's so powerful that at times

143
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:55,589
the US government has actually
classified it as a weapon.

144
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:01,068
During World War II,
breaking cryptosystems like Enigma

145
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:04,396
was critical to decoding
enemy transmissions

146
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,324
and turning the tide of the war.

147
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:10,412
Today, anyone with a modern
web browser is running

148
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,498
a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.

149
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,991
It's what we use to secure
our interactions on the Internet.

150
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,176
It's what makes it safe for us
to type our passwords in

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,891
and to send financial
information to websites.

152
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:26,149
So what the banks used to give us --

153
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,393
trustworthy digital money transfer --

154
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:32,635
we can now get with a clever
application of cryptography.

155
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:36,109
And this means that we don't
have to rely on the banks anymore

156
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,764
to secure our transactions.

157
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,077
We can do it ourselves.

158
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:45,596
Bitcoin is based on the very same
idea that the Yap used,

159
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,922
this collective global
knowledge of transfers.

160
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:53,464
In Bitcoin, I spend
by transferring Bitcoin,

161
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,659
and I get paid when someone
transfers Bitcoin to me.

162
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:01,068
Imagine that we had this magic paper.

163
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,299
So the way that this paper works
is I can give you a sheet of it

164
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:07,053
and if you write something on it,

165
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,700
it will magically appear
on my piece as well.

166
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,567
Let's say we just give everyone this paper

167
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:17,419
and everyone writes down
the transfers that they're doing

168
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:18,899
in the Bitcoin system.

169
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:23,634
All of these transfers get copied
around to everyone else's pieces of paper.

170
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,676
And I can look at mine

171
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,225
and I'll have a list of all
of the transfers that are happening

172
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,138
in the entire Bitcoin economy.

173
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,341
This is actually what's happening
with the Bitcoin blockchain,

174
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:39,161
which is a list of all
of the transactions in Bitcoin.

175
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,999
Except, it's not done through paper.

176
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,719
It's done through computer code,

177
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,406
running on thousands
of networked computers

178
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,638
around the world.

179
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,979
All of these computers
are collectively confirming

180
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,887
who owns what Bitcoin.

181
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:58,324
So the Bitcoin blockchain
is core to how Bitcoin works.

182
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,253
But where do bitcoins actually come from?

183
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,790
Well, the code is designed
to create new Bitcoin

184
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,111
according to a schedule.

185
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,096
And the way that it works
is that to get those Bitcoin,

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,906
I have to solve a puzzle --
a random cryptographic puzzle.

187
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,480
Imagine that we had 15 dice,

188
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:22,117
and we were throwing these dice
over and over again.

189
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:25,035
Whenever the dice come up all sixes,

190
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,274
we say that we win.

191
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,971
This is very close to what these computers
are all actually doing.

192
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:34,243
They're trying over and over again
to land on the right number.

193
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,043
And when they do,

194
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,268
we say that they've solved the puzzle.

195
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,999
The computer that solves the puzzle

196
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,941
publishes its solution
to the rest of the network

197
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,892
and collects its reward: new bitcoins.

198
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,984
And in the act of solving this puzzle,

199
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:55,084
these computers are actually
helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain

200
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,189
and add to the list of transactions.

201
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:03,483
There are actually people
all over the world running this software,

202
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,580
and we call them Bitcoin miners.

203
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:09,174
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.

204
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,417
You can go download the software right now

205
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:15,806
and run it in your computer
and try to collect some bitcoins.

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,244
I can't say that I would recommend it,

207
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:23,369
because right now, the puzzle is so hard
and the network is so powerful,

208
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:26,322
that if I tried to mine
Bitcoin on my laptop,

209
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:29,654
I probably wouldn't see any
for about two million years.

210
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:34,643
The miners, professional miners,
use this special hardware

211
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,402
that's designed to solve
the puzzle really fast.

212
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:41,818
Now, the Bitcoin network
and all of this special hardware,

213
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:44,877
there are estimates
that the amount of energy it uses

214
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,268
is equivalent to that of a small country.

215
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,752
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies

216
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,750
are a little bit slow
and a little bit cumbersome.

217
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:58,720
But the next generation is going
to be so much better and so much faster.

218
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:01,149
Cryptocurrencies are the first step

219
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,633
to a world with a global
programmable money.

220
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,719
And in a world with programmable money,

221
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:11,958
I can pay anyone else securely

222
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,555
without having to sign up
or ask permission,

223
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,398
or do a conversion or worry
about my money getting stuck.

224
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:23,022
And I can send money around the world.

225
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,881
This is a really amazing thing.

226
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:29,540
It's the idea of permission-less innovation.

227
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:35,171
The Internet caused
an explosion of innovation,

228
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:38,654
because it was built upon
an open architecture.

229
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:42,311
And just like the Internet
changed the way we communicate,

230
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:46,380
programmable money is going
to change the way we pay,

231
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:48,978
allocate and decide on value.

232
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:52,214
So what kind of world
does programmable money create?

233
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:56,454
Imagine a world where I can
rent out my healthcare data

234
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:58,048
to a pharmaceutical company.

235
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,568
They can run large-scale data analysis

236
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,964
and provide me with a cryptographic proof

237
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:08,114
that shows they're only using my data
in a way that we agreed.

238
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:10,386
And they can pay me
for what they find out.

239
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,238
Instead of signing up
for streaming services

240
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:15,831
and getting a cable bill,

241
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:18,861
what if my television analyzed
my watching habits

242
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:22,557
and recommended well-priced content
that fit within my budget

243
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:23,780
that I would enjoy?

244
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,470
Imagine an Internet without ads,

245
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:31,501
because instead of paying
with our attention when we view content,

246
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,821
we just pay.

247
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,142
Interestingly, things like micro-payments

248
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,321
are actually going to change
the way security works in our world,

249
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:42,040
because once we're better able
to allocate value,

250
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:45,088
people will use their money
and their energies

251
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,290
for more constructive things.

252
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,316
If it cost a fraction of a cent
to send an email,

253
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,802
would we still have spam?

254
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:54,877
We're not at this world yet,

255
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,358
but it's coming.

256
00:13:56,382 --> 00:14:00,719
Right now, it's like we're in a world
that is seeing the first automobile.

257
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:04,564
The first cryptocurrency,
like the first car,

258
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:09,260
is slow and hard to understand
and hard to use.

259
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:12,641
Digital money,
like the horse and carriage,

260
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,195
works pretty well,

261
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:17,264
and the whole world economy
is built on it.

262
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:20,460
If you were the first person on your block

263
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,255
to get a car with an internal
combustion engine,

264
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,777
your neighbors would probably
think you were crazy:

265
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,794
"Why would you want
this large, clunky machine

266
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,723
that breaks down all the time,
that lights on fire,

267
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,084
and is still slower than a horse?"

268
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,139
But we all know how that story turns out.

269
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:42,001
We're entering a new era
of programmable money.

270
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,076
And it's very exciting,
but it's also a little bit scary.

271
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,205
Cryptocurrencies can be used
for illegal transactions,

272
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:53,474
just like cash is used for crime
in the world today.

273
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,975
When all of our transactions are online,

274
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:00,318
what does that mean for surveillance --
who can see what we do?

275
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:05,202
Who's advantaged
in this new world and who isn't?

276
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:08,900
Will I have to start to pay for things
that I didn't have to pay for before?

277
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:13,259
Will we all become slaves
to algorithms and utility functions?

278
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,518
All new technology comes with trade-offs.

279
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:21,901
The Internet brought us
a lot of ways to waste time.

280
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,096
But it also greatly
increased productivity.

281
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,237
Mobile phones are annoying

282
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,245
because they make me feel
like I have to stay connected to work

283
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,424
all the time.

284
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,274
But they also help me stay connected
to friends and family.

285
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:39,618
The new sharing economy
is going to eliminate some jobs.

286
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:44,059
But it's also going to create
new, flexible forms of employment.

287
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,527
With programmable money,

288
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:51,503
we decouple the need
for large, trusted institutions

289
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:53,820
from the architecture of the network.

290
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,656
And this pushes innovation in money
out to the edges, where it belongs.

291
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,774
Programmable money democratizes money.

292
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,219
And because of this,
things are going to change and unfold

293
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:09,234
in ways that we can't even predict.

294
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:11,650
Thank you.

295
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:15,638
(Applause)
