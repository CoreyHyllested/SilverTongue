0
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,928
Will we do whatever it takes
to tackle climate change?

1
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:22,366
I come at this question
not as a green campaigner,

2
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,985
in fact, I confess to be rather
hopeless at recycling.

3
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:30,669
I come at it as a professional observer
of financial policy making

4
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:35,450
and someone that wonders
how history will judge us.

5
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,609
One day,

6
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,498
this ring that belonged to my grandfather

7
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,529
will pass to my son, Charlie.

8
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,829
And I wonder what his generation

9
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:49,159
and perhaps the one that follows

10
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:54,021
will make of the two lives
this ring has worked.

11
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:57,518
My grandfather was a coal miner.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,677
In his time,

13
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:05,585
burning fossil fuels for energy
and for allowing economies to develop

14
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,766
was accepted.

15
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,577
We know now that that is not the case

16
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,983
because of the greenhouse
gases that coal produces.

17
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:16,532
But today,

18
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:20,602
I fear it's the industry in which I work
that will be judged more harshly

19
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:22,662
because of its impact on the climate --

20
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:25,845
more harshly than
my grandfather's industry, even.

21
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,888
I work, of course,
in the banking industry,

22
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:32,704
which will be remembered
for its crisis in 2008 --

23
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:38,722
a crisis that diverted the attention
and finances of governments

24
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:44,127
away from some really, really
important promises,

25
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:49,291
like promises made at the Copenhagen
Climate Summit in 2009

26
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:52,147
to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year

27
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:56,685
to help developing countries
move away from burning fossil fuels

28
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,688
and transition to using cleaner energy.

29
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:03,391
That promise is already in jeopardy.

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,769
And that's a real problem,

31
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,534
because that transition
to cleaner energy needs to happen

32
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,470
sooner rather than later.

33
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:12,340
Firstly,

34
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:14,342
because greenhouse gases, once released,

35
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,059
stay in the atmosphere for decades.

36
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,271
And secondly,

37
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:24,122
if a developing economy builds
its power grid around fossil fuels today,

38
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,299
it's going to be way more costly
to change later on.

39
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,462
So for the climate,

40
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:34,312
history may judge
that the banking crisis happened

41
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,315
at just the wrong time.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,608
The story need not be this gloomy, though.

43
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,577
Three years ago,

44
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,497
I argued that governments
could use the tools

45
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:49,206
deployed to save the financial system

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,118
to meet other global challenges.

47
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:57,041
And these arguments are getting
stronger, not weaker, with time.

48
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:02,746
Let's take a brief reminder
of what those tools looked like.

49
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,565
When the financial crisis hit in 2008,

50
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,166
the central banks of the US and UK

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,625
began buying bonds issued
by their own governments

52
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,948
in a policy known
as "quantitative easing."

53
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:19,095
Depending on what happens
to those bonds when they mature,

54
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,529
this is money printing by another name.

55
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,254
And boy, did they print.

56
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:29,352
The US alone created four trillion
dollars' worth of its own currency.

57
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,465
This was not done in isolation.

58
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,163
In a remarkable act of cooperation,

59
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:38,760
the 188 countries that make up
the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,

60
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:42,953
agreed to issue 250 billion
dollars' worth of their own currency --

61
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:45,049
the Special Drawing Right --

62
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,046
to boost reserves around the world.

63
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,263
When the financial crisis moved to Europe,

64
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:55,067
the European Central Bank
President, Mario Draghi,

65
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,855
promised "to do whatever it takes."

66
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,768
And they did.

67
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:06,050
The Bank of Japan repeated those words --
that exact same commitment --

68
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:10,185
to do "whatever it takes"
to reflate their economy.

69
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,376
In both cases,

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,639
"whatever it takes" meant
trillions of dollars more

71
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:20,891
in money-printing policies
that continue today.

72
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,122
What this shows

73
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,912
is that when faced
with some global challenges,

74
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:32,707
policy makers are able to act
collectively, with urgency,

75
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:38,861
and run the risks of unconventional
policies like money printing.

76
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,560
So, let's go back
to that original question:

77
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:48,355
Can we print money for climate finance?

78
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,931
Three years ago,

79
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:54,690
the idea of using money in this way
was something of a taboo.

80
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:57,890
Once you break down and dismantle the idea

81
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,953
that money is a finite resource,

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,063
governments can quickly get overwhelmed
by demands from their people

83
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,313
to print more and more
money for other causes:

84
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,337
education, health care, welfare --

85
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,591
even defense.

86
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:17,822
And there are some truly terrible
historical examples of money printing --

87
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,169
uncontrolled money printing --

88
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,938
leading to hyperinflation.

89
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:26,350
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;

90
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,447
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,

91
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,535
when the prices of basic goods
like bread are doubling every day.

92
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:39,896
But all of this is moving
the public debate forward,

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,248
so much so, that money printing
for the people is now discussed openly

94
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:49,486
in the financial media, and even
in some political manifestos.

95
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:52,742
But it's important the debate
doesn't stop here,

96
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,949
with printing national currencies.

97
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:01,851
Because climate change
is a shared global problem,

98
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,945
there are some really compelling reasons

99
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,398
why we should be printing
that international currency

100
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:10,280
that's issued by the IMF,

101
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,535
to fund it.

102
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:15,149
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,

103
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,529
is the IMF's electronic unit of account

104
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:23,105
that governments use to transfer
funds amongst each other.

105
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,674
Think of it as a peer-to-peer
payment network,

106
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:29,474
like Bitcoin, but for governments.

107
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,220
And it's truly global.

108
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:38,277
Each of the 188 members
of the IMF hold SDR quotas

109
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,043
as part of their foreign
exchange reserves.

110
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,223
These are national stores of wealth

111
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,678
that countries keep to protect
themselves against currency crises.

112
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:51,059
And that global nature is why,

113
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,011
at the height of the financial
crisis in 2009,

114
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,128
the IMF issued those extra
250 billion dollars --

115
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,723
because it served
as a collective global action

116
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:07,554
that safeguarded countries
large and small in one fell swoop.

117
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,339
But here --

118
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,029
here's the intriguing part.

119
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:18,285
More than half of those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009 --

120
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,295
150 billion dollars' worth --

121
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,634
went to developed market countries
who, for the most part,

122
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:27,495
have a modest need
for these foreign exchange reserves,

123
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,950
because they have flexible exchange rates.

124
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:34,808
So those extra reserves
that were printed in 2009,

125
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:38,303
in the end, for developed
market countries at least,

126
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:39,953
weren't really needed.

127
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:42,781
And they remain unused today.

128
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,002
So here's an idea.

129
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,398
As a first step,

130
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,112
why don't we start
spending those unused,

131
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,603
those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009,

132
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:55,174
to combat climate change?

133
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,461
They could, for example,

134
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:02,185
be used to buy bonds issued
by the UN's Green Climate Fund.

135
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,797
This was a fund created in 2009,

136
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,095
following that climate
agreement in Copenhagen.

137
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,262
And it was designed to channel funds
towards developing countries

138
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,353
to meet their climate projects.

139
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:19,236
It's been one of the most
successful funds of its type,

140
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,564
raising almost 10 billion dollars.

141
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,026
But if we use those extra
SDRs that were issued,

142
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,362
it helps governments get back on track,

143
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,209
to meet that promise
of 100 billion dollars a year

144
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,823
that was derailed by the financial crisis.

145
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,674
It could also --

146
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,344
it could also serve as a test case.

147
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:47,455
If the inflationary consequences
of using SDRs in this way are benign,

148
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,429
it could be used to justify

149
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:55,187
the additional, extra issuance
of SDRs, say, every five years,

150
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,606
again, with the commitment

151
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,060
that developed-market countries
would direct their share

152
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,545
of the new reserves

153
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,362
to the Green Climate Fund.

154
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:10,800
Printing international money
in this way has several advantages

155
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,885
over printing national currencies.

156
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,315
The first is it's really easy to argue

157
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,756
that spending money to mitigate
climate change benefits everyone.

158
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:25,225
No one section of society benefits
from the printing press over another.

159
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,033
That problem of competing
claims is mitigated.

160
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:30,803
It's also fair to say

161
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:35,954
that because it takes so many countries
to agree to issue these extra SDRs,

162
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:40,181
it's highly unlikely that money printing
would get out of control.

163
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:46,025
What you end up with
is a collective, global action

164
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:50,212
aimed -- and it's controlled
global action --

165
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,825
aimed at a global good.

166
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:54,845
And,

167
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,436
as we've learned
with the money-printing schemes,

168
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,292
whatever concerns we have
can be allayed by rules.

169
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,639
So, for example,

170
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:07,636
the issuance of these extra SDRs
every five years could be capped,

171
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,255
such that this international currency
is never more than five percent

172
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,241
of global foreign exchange reserves.

173
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,806
That's important because it would allay

174
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,726
well, let's say, the ridiculous
concerns that the US might have

175
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,272
that the SDR could ever challenge
the dollar's dominant role

176
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:27,892
in international finance.

177
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,997
And in fact,

178
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,415
I think the only thing that the SDR
would likely steal from the dollar

179
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:34,908
under this scheme

180
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,403
is its nickname, the "greenback."

181
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:42,343
Because even with that cap in place,

182
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,831
the IMF could have
followed up its issuance --

183
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,903
its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --

184
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:53,919
with a further 200 billion
dollars of SDRs in 2014.

185
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:57,050
So hypothetically,

186
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:01,170
that would mean that developed countries
could have contributed

187
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,715
up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs

188
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,389
to the Green Climate Fund.

189
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:11,646
That's 30 times what it has today.

190
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,826
And you know,

191
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,691
as spectacular as that sounds,

192
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,770
it's only just beginning to look
like "whatever it takes."

193
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,447
And just to think what amazing things
could be done with that money,

194
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,682
consider this:

195
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,246
in 2009,

196
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,008
Norway promised one billion dollars
of its reserves to Brazil

197
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:37,695
if they followed through
on their goals on deforestation.

198
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:44,892
That program has since delivered
a 70 percent reduction in deforestation

199
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,327
in the past decade.

200
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:51,264
That's saving 3,2 billion tons
of carbon dioxide emissions,

201
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:55,819
which is the equivalent of taking
all American cars off the roads

202
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:58,129
for three whole years.

203
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,006
So what could we do

204
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,074
with 300 other pay-for-performance
climate projects like that,

205
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:08,977
organized on a global scale?

206
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,804
We could take cars off the roads
for a generation.

207
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,534
So,

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,283
let's not quibble about whether we can
afford to fund climate change.

209
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:23,125
The real question is:

210
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,546
Do we care enough about future generations

211
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,611
to take the very same policy risks
we took to save the financial system?

212
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,421
After all,

213
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,468
we could do it,

214
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,435
we did do it

215
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,190
and we are doing it today.

216
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:44,126
We must, must, must do
"whatever it takes."

217
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:46,577
Thank you.

218
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,967
(Applause)
