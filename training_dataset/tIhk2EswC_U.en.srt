0
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A human child is born,

1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and for quite a long time

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is a consumer.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It cannot be consciously a contributor.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is helpless.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It doesn't know how to survive,

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:05,000
even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It has to totally surrender,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It has to totally surrender.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That implies a lot of trust.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That implies the trusted person

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
won't violate the trust.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As the child grows,

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it begins to discover

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that the person trusted is violating the trust.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It doesn't know even the word "violation."

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Therefore, it has to blame itself,

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
a wordless blame,

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which is more difficult to really resolve --

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the wordless self-blame.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As the child grows to become an adult:

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so far, it has been a consumer,

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but the growth of a human being

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
lies in his or her capacity to contribute,

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to be a contributor.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
one feels big,

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
one feels: I have enough.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To be compassionate is not a joke.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not that simple.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That bigness should be centered on oneself,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
not in terms of money,

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
not in terms of power you wield,

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but it should be centered on oneself.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The self: you are self-aware.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can be compassionate occasionally,

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
more moved by empathy

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
than by compassion.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank God we are empathetic.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In a Wimbledon final match,

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
these two guys fight it out.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Each one has got two games.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It can be anybody's game.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One person wins.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and shake hands.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The winner boxes the air

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and kisses the ground,

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
(Laughter)

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And this guy has to come to the net.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When he comes to the net,

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you see, his whole face changes.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why? Empathy.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's human heart.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No human heart is denied of that empathy.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No culture, no nation and nationalism --

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
nothing can touch it

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because it is empathy.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And that capacity to empathize

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
is the window through which you reach out to people,

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
even words, even time.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Compassion is not defined in one form.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There's no Indian compassion.

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There's no American compassion.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why? Because it is there in everybody.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's experienced by people occasionally.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then this occasional compassion,

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we are not talking about --

82
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it will never remain occasional.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.

84
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You can't say, "Please love me."

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Love is something you discover.

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's not an action,

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but in the English language, it is also an action.

88
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will come to it later.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
which is within our experience, everybody's experience.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In spite of a very tragic life,

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And the one who is happy,

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
even for a slapstick joke,

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That means the whole universe,

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
known things and unknown things.

99
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All of them are totally accepted

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
because you discover your wholeness in yourself.

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The subject -- "me" --

102
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and the object -- the scheme of things --

103
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
fuse into oneness,

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
an experience common to all and sundry.

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and layoffs

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and, finally, baldness --

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you can be happy.

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But the extension of the logic is

112
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There's no choice in this:

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that only confirms the reality

116
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that the wholeness cannot be different from you,

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
cannot be minus you.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It has got to be you.

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You cannot be a part of wholeness

120
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and still be whole.

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that realization, that recognition:

123
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
"Maybe I am the whole.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Maybe the swami is right.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then everything becomes meaningful.

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have no more reason to blame myself.

128
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.

132
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and power is therefore limited,

134
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Compassion is going to be limited.

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everything is going to be limitless.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You cannot command compassion

138
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,

139
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
either you are or you are not. Period.

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And the wholeness is the reality of you

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
when you relate to the world.

144
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It is love first.

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When you relate to the world,

146
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness

147
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is, what we say, love.

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And itself becomes compassion

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.

150
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You express yourself because you have compassion.

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.

153
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
To discover the capacity to give and share,

154
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you need to be giving and sharing.

155
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.

156
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You learn swimming by swimming.

157
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
(Laughter)

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You learn cooking by cooking,

161
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
having some sympathetic people around you

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to eat what you cook.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
(Laughter)

164
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And, therefore, what I say,

165
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you have to fake it and make it.

166
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
(Laughter)

167
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You need to.

168
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
My predecessor meant that.

169
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You have to act it out.

170
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You have to act compassionately.

171
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There is no verb for compassion,

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but you have an adverb for compassion.

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's interesting to me.

174
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You act compassionately.

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That is where you fake.

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.

178
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
(Laughter)

179
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You fake it and make it.

180
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:

181
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
grind your teeth,

182
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
take all the support system.

183
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If you know how to pray, pray.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ask for compassion.

185
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let me act compassionately.

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Do it.

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You'll discover compassion

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and also slowly a relative compassion,

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation

191
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and that's what you are.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
With these words, thank you very much.

194
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
(Applause)
