00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:16,786
Today's computers are so amazing

1
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,931
that we fail to notice
how terrible they really are.

2
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,570
I'd like to talk to you today
about this problem,

3
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,265
and how we can fix it with neuroscience.

4
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:32,073
First, I'd like to take you back
to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011

5
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,884
that had a profound impact on me.

6
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:37,611
I was sitting in a dive bar
outside of Columbia University,

7
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,543
where I studied computer science
and neuroscience,

8
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:43,635
and I was having this great conversation
with a fellow student

9
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,962
about the power of holograms
to one day replace computers.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,479
And just as we were getting
to the best part of the conversation,

11
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,065
of course, his phone lights up.

12
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:57,046
And he pulls it towards himself,
and he looks down and he starts typing.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,253
And then he forces his eyeballs
back up to mine and he goes,

14
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,380
"Keep going. I'm with you."

15
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:04,761
But of course his eyes were glazed over,

16
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:06,128
and the moment was dead.

17
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,184
Meanwhile across the bar,

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,492
I noticed another student
holding his phone,

19
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,961
this time towards a group.

20
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,745
He was swiping through
pictures on Instagram,

21
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:17,303
and these kids were laughing hysterically.

22
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,846
And that dichotomy
between how crappy I was feeling

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,648
and how happy they were feeling
about the same technology,

24
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,050
really got me thinking.

25
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:27,407
And the more I thought of it,
the more I realized

26
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:31,203
it was clearly not the digital information
that was the bad guy here,

27
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,934
it was simply the display position
that was separating me from my friend

28
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,179
and that was binding those kids together.

29
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,807
See, they were connected around something,

30
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:43,229
just like our ancestors
who evolved their social cognitions

31
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:45,298
telling stories around the campfire.

32
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,201
And that's exactly what tools
should do, I think.

33
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,704
They should extend our bodies.

34
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:52,397
And I think computers today
are doing quite the opposite.

35
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,167
Whether you're sending
an email to your wife

36
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,213
or you're composing a symphony

37
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:58,841
or just consoling a friend,

38
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,211
you're doing it in pretty
much the same way.

39
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,468
You're hunched over these rectangles,

40
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:06,243
fumbling with buttons and menus
and more rectangles.

41
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,756
And I think this is the wrong way,

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,208
I think we can start using
a much more natural machine.

43
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,750
We should use machines that bring
our work back into the world.

44
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:18,793
We should use machines that use
the principles of neuroscience

45
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:22,816
to extend our senses
versus going against them.

46
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:26,092
Now it just so happens
that I have such a machine here.

47
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,273
It's called the Meta 2.

48
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,487
Let's try it out.

49
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,430
Now in front of me right now,
I can see the audience,

50
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,488
and I can see my very hands.

51
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,203
And in three, two, one,

52
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,979
we're going to see an immersive
hologram appear,

53
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,283
a very realistic hologram
appear in front of me,

54
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:52,871
of our very glasses I'm wearing
on my head right now.

55
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:55,736
And of course this could be
anything that we're shopping for

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,911
or learning from,

57
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,278
and I can use my hands

58
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:02,410
to very nicely kind of move
it around with fine control.

59
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:05,629
And I think Iron Man would be proud.

60
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:09,021
We're going to come back
to this in just a bit.

61
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,947
(Applause)

62
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:14,882
Now if you're anything like me,
your mind is already reeling

63
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:18,207
with the possibilities of what we can do
with this kind of technology,

64
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,389
so let's look at a few.

65
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,563
My mom is an architect,

66
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,492
so naturally the first thing I imagined

67
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,997
was laying out a building in 3D space

68
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,413
instead of having to use
these 2D floor plans.

69
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,902
She's actually touching graphics right now

70
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,703
and selecting an interior decor.

71
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:35,091
This was all shot through a GoPro
through our very glasses.

72
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,730
And this next use case
is very personal to me,

73
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:41,168
it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's
glass brain project,

74
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,083
courtesy of UCSF.

75
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,802
As a neuroscience student,

76
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,223
I would always fantasize

77
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:51,686
about the ability to learn and memorize
these complex brain structures

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,877
with an actual machine,

79
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,203
where I could touch and play
with the various brain structures.

80
00:03:56,535 --> 00:04:00,061
Now what you're seeing
is called augmented reality,

81
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:03,036
but to me, it's part
of a much more important story --

82
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:10,203
a story of how we can begin
to extend our bodies with digital devices,

83
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,711
instead of the other way around.

84
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,203
Now ...

85
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:18,589
in the next few years, humanity's
going to go through a shift, I think.

86
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:21,826
We're going to start putting
an entire layer of digital information

87
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,285
on the real world.

88
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,318
Just imagine for a moment

89
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,602
what this could mean for storytellers,

90
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:28,941
for painters,

91
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,123
for brain surgeons,

92
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,964
for interior decorators

93
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:35,099
and maybe for all of us here today.

94
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,711
And what I think we need
to do as a community,

95
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,727
is really try and make an effort

96
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:42,642
to imagine how we can
create this new reality

97
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,364
in a way that extends
the human experience,

98
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,356
instead of gamifying our reality

99
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,443
or cluttering it with digital information.

100
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,589
And that's what I'm very passionate about.

101
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:54,479
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.

102
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,670
In about five years --

103
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,320
this is not the smallest device --

104
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,512
in about five years,

105
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,464
these are all going to look like
strips of glass on our eyes

106
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,807
that project holograms.

107
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:06,736
And just like we don't care so much
about which phone we buy

108
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,181
in terms of the hardware -- we buy it
for the operating system --

109
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,364
as a neuroscientist,

110
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:15,431
I always dreamt of building
the iOS of the mind, if you will.

111
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:19,417
And it's very, very important
that we get this right,

112
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,735
because we might be living
inside of these things

113
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,447
for at least as long as we've lived

114
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,112
with the Windows graphical user interface.

115
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,453
And I don't know about you,

116
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,985
but living inside of Windows scares me.

117
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,329
(Laughter)

118
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:35,243
To isolate the single most intuitive
interface out of infinity,

119
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,947
we use neuroscience to drive
our design guidelines,

120
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,561
instead of letting a bunch of designers
fight it out in the boardroom.

121
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:44,234
And the principle we all revolve around

122
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:47,266
is what's called the "Neural Path
of Least Resistance."

123
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,421
At every turn, we're connecting
the iOS of the brain with our brain

124
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,831
on, for the first time, our brain's terms.

125
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:58,247
In other words, we're trying to create
a zero learning-curve computer.

126
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:02,073
We're building a system
that you've always known how to use.

127
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:04,990
Here are the first three
design guidelines that we employ

128
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,345
in this brand-new form of user experience.

129
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,763
First and foremost,
you are the operating system.

130
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,494
Traditional file systems
are complex and abstract,

131
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:16,109
and they take your brain
extra steps to decode them.

132
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,938
We're going against the Neural Path
of Least Resistance.

133
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,160
Meanwhile, in augmented reality,

134
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:26,159
you can of course place
your holographic TED panel over here,

135
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,734
and your holographic email
on the other side of the desk,

136
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:35,581
and your spatial memory evolved just fine
to go ahead and retrieve them.

137
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,633
You could put your holographic Tesla
that you're shopping for --

138
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:42,162
or whatever model my legal team
told me to put in right before the show.

139
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:43,188
(Laughter)

140
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,944
Perfect. And your brain knows
exactly how to get it back.

141
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,216
The second interface guideline
we call "touch to see."

142
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,300
What do babies do when they see
something that grabs their interest?

143
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,428
They try and reach out and touch it.

144
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:59,519
And that's exactly how the natural
machine should work as well.

145
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,927
Turns out the visual system
gets a fundamental boost

146
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,360
from a sense we call proprioception --

147
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,629
that's the sense
of our body parts in space.

148
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:11,463
So by touching our work directly,
we're not only going to control it better,

149
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,065
we're also going to understand
it much more deeply.

150
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,299
Hence, touch to see.

151
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:18,718
But it's not enough
to experience things ourselves.

152
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,969
We're inherently these social primates.

153
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:23,105
And this leads me to our third guideline,

154
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,926
the holographic campfire
from our first story.

155
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,451
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests

156
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:32,023
that we can connect with each other
and with our work much better

157
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:35,032
if we can see each other's
faces and hands in 3D.

158
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,893
So if you look at the video behind me,

159
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:41,226
you can see two Meta users
playing around with the same hologram,

160
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,965
making eye contact,
connected around this thing,

161
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,680
instead of being distracted
by external devices.

162
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,624
Let's go ahead and try this again
with neuroscience in mind.

163
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,471
So again, our favorite interface,
the iOS of the mind.

164
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,226
I'm going to now take a step further

165
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,000
and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses

166
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,744
and leave it right here by the desk.

167
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,490
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,

168
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:09,666
we're connecting.

169
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,608
My spatial memory kicks in,
and I can go ahead and grab it

170
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,733
and bring it right back here, reminding me

171
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:16,643
that I am the operating system.

172
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,047
And now my proprioception is working,

173
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:22,867
and I can go ahead and explode
these glasses into a thousand parts

174
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:27,281
and touch the very sensor
that is currently scanning my hand.

175
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,266
But it's not enough to see things alone,

176
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,262
so in a second, my co-founder Ray
is going to make a 3D call --

177
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:33,444
Ray?

178
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:34,954
(Ringing)

179
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:36,883
Hey Ray, how's it going?

180
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:40,335
Guys, I can see this guy
in front me in full 3D.

181
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,656
And he is photo-realistic.

182
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,976
(Applause)

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,152
Thank you.

184
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:49,157
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests
that this is going to replace phones

185
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,577
in not too long.

186
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,419
Ray, how's it going?

187
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,808
Ray: Great. We're live today.

188
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,381
(Applause)

189
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,517
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift

190
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,176
of the holographic brain
we saw from the video earlier.

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,358
Guys, this is not only
going to change phones,

192
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,192
it's also going to change
the way we collaborate.

193
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,963
Thank you so much.

194
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,145
Thanks, Ray.

195
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,320
Ray: You're welcome.

196
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,351
(Applause)

197
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:16,323
MG: So folks, this is the message
that I discovered in that bar in 2011:

198
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,488
The future of computers is not
locked inside one of these screens.

199
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:23,711
It's right here, inside of us.

200
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:29,455
(Applause)

201
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,836
So if there's one idea that I could
leave you with here today,

202
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,916
it's that the natural machine
is not some figment of the future,

203
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,973
it's right here in 2016.

204
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,222
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,

205
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,921
including the administrative staff,

206
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,387
the executives,

207
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,134
the designers, the engineers --

208
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,060
before TED2017,

209
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:51,741
we're all going to be throwing
away our external monitors

210
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:56,885
and replacing them with a truly
and profoundly more natural machine.

211
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,100
Thank you very much.

212
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,925
(Applause)

213
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,372
Thank you, appreciate it.

214
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:06,658
Thanks, guys.

215
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:12,772
Chris Anderson: So help
me out on one thing,

216
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:15,424
because there've been a few
augmented reality demos

217
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,154
shown over the last year or so out there.

218
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,587
And there's sometimes
a debate among technologists

219
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:24,316
about, are we really seeing
the real thing on-screen?

220
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,080
There's this issue of field of view,

221
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:29,570
that somehow the technology
is showing a broader view

222
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:32,515
than you would actually see
wearing the glasses.

223
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:34,809
Were we seeing the real deal there?

224
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,246
MG: Absolutely the real deal.

225
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,427
Not only that,

226
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:40,788
we took extra measures to shoot it
with a GoPro through the actual lens

227
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,865
in the various videos
that you've seen here.

228
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,465
We want to try to simulate
the experience for the world

229
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:47,682
that we're actually seeing
through the glasses,

230
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:48,857
and not cut any corners.

231
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,905
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.

232
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,754
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
