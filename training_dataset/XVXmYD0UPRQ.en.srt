00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,318
Here are two reasons companies fail:

1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,167
they only do more of the same,

2
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,659
or they only do what's new.

3
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:28,513
To me the real, real
solution to quality growth

4
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:32,102
is figuring out the balance
between two activities:

5
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:34,698
exploration and exploitation.

6
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:36,704
Both are necessary,

7
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,441
but it can be too much of a good thing.

8
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:42,386
Consider Facit.

9
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,465
I'm actually old enough to remember them.

10
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,657
Facit was a fantastic company.

11
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,472
They were born deep in the Swedish forest,

12
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:54,002
and they made the best
mechanical calculators in the world.

13
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,900
Everybody used them.

14
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:00,977
And what did Facit do when
the electronic calculator came along?

15
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,414
They continued doing exactly the same.

16
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:08,671
In six months, they went
from maximum revenue ...

17
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:09,931
and they were gone.

18
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:11,800
Gone.

19
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:15,696
To me, the irony about the Facit story

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,986
is hearing about the Facit engineers,

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,093
who had bought cheap, small
electronic calculators in Japan

22
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,778
that they used to double-check
their calculators.

23
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,215
(Laughter)

24
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,887
Facit did too much exploitation.

25
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,876
But exploration can go wild, too.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,051
A few years back,

27
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:40,101
I worked closely alongside
a European biotech company.

28
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,806
Let's call them OncoSearch.

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,487
The company was brilliant.

30
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:49,129
They had applications that promised
to diagnose, even cure,

31
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,645
certain forms of blood cancer.

32
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,720
Every day was about
creating something new.

33
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:58,248
They were extremely innovative,

34
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,148
and the mantra was,
"When we only get it right,"

35
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,830
or even, "We want it perfect."

36
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,544
The sad thing is,

37
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:08,466
before they became perfect --

38
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,419
even good enough --

39
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,037
they became obsolete.

40
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,352
OncoSearch did too much exploration.

41
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:23,357
I first heard about exploration
and exploitation about 15 years ago,

42
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:26,881
when I worked as a visiting
scholar at Stanford University.

43
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:30,144
The founder of the idea is Jim March.

44
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:34,551
And to me the power of the idea
is its practicality.

45
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,823
Exploration.

46
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:40,217
Exploration is about
coming up with what's new.

47
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:42,003
It's about search,

48
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:43,470
it's about discovery,

49
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,056
it's about new products,

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,921
it's about new innovations.

51
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,595
It's about changing our frontiers.

52
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:54,843
Our heroes are people
who have done exploration:

53
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,208
Madame Curie,

54
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:57,390
Picasso,

55
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:58,588
Neil Armstrong,

56
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,771
Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,545
I come from Norway;

58
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,353
all our heroes are explorers,
and they deserve to be.

59
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,430
We all know that exploration is risky.

60
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:14,273
We don't know the answers,

61
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:16,368
we don't know if we're going to find them,

62
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,669
and we know that the risks are high.

63
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:20,584
Exploitation is the opposite.

64
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:23,685
Exploitation is taking
the knowledge we have

65
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,504
and making good, better.

66
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:29,647
Exploitation is about making
our trains run on time.

67
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:33,972
It's about making good products
faster and cheaper.

68
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,944
Exploitation is not risky --

69
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,072
in the short term.

70
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,401
But if we only exploit,

71
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,818
it's very risky in the long term.

72
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:48,261
And I think we all have memories
of the famous pop groups

73
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,236
who keep singing the same songs
again and again,

74
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,325
until they become obsolete
or even pathetic.

75
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,448
That's the risk of exploitation.

76
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,432
So if we take a long-term
perspective, we explore.

77
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:08,604
If we take a short-term
perspective, we exploit.

78
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,144
Small children, they explore all day.

79
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,675
All day it's about exploration.

80
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,739
As we grow older,

81
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:20,641
we explore less because we have
more knowledge to exploit on.

82
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,763
The same goes for companies.

83
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:28,570
Companies become,
by nature, less innovative

84
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,483
as they become more competent.

85
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,493
And this is, of course,
a big worry to CEOs.

86
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,919
And I hear very often questions
phrased in different ways.

87
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:41,101
For example,

88
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:45,673
"How can I both effectively run
and reinvent my company?"

89
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,451
Or, "How can I make sure

90
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:52,836
that our company changes
before we become obsolete

91
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,474
or are hit by a crisis?"

92
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,140
So, doing one well is difficult.

93
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,931
Doing both well as the same time is art --

94
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,800
pushing both exploration and exploitation.

95
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,634
So one thing we've found

96
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:13,354
is only about two percent of companies
are able to effectively explore

97
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:16,723
and exploit at the same time, in parallel.

98
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,454
But when they do,

99
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,427
the payoffs are huge.

100
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,726
So we have lots of great examples.

101
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,466
We have NestlÃ© creating Nespresso,

102
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,512
we have Lego going into animated films,

103
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,942
Toyota creating the hybrids,

104
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,437
Unilever pushing into sustainability --

105
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,642
there are lots of examples,
and the benefits are huge.

106
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:42,348
Why is balancing so difficult?

107
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,476
I think it's difficult
because there are so many traps

108
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,150
that keep us where we are.

109
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:50,338
So I'll talk about two,
but there are many.

110
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:54,086
So let's talk about
the perpetual search trap.

111
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,428
We discover something,

112
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,307
but we don't have the patience
or the persistence

113
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,659
to get at it and make it work.

114
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,828
So instead of staying with it,
we create something new.

115
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,152
But the same goes for that,

116
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,927
then we're in the vicious circle

117
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,263
of actually coming up with ideas
but being frustrated.

118
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,701
OncoSearch was a good example.

119
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,548
A famous example is, of course, Xerox.

120
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:20,707
But we don't only see this in companies.

121
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,245
We see this in the public sector as well.

122
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:29,448
We all know that any kind
of effective reform of education,

123
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,899
research, health care, even defense,

124
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:35,326
takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.

125
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,578
But still, we change much more often.

126
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,975
We really don't give them the chance.

127
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:45,444
Another trap is the success trap.

128
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,555
Facit fell into the success trap.

129
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:53,525
They literally held
the future in their hands,

130
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:54,763
but they couldn't see it.

131
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:58,542
They were simply so good
at making what they loved doing,

132
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,232
that they wouldn't change.

133
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,480
We are like that, too.

134
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:05,251
When we know something well,
it's difficult to change.

135
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,170
Bill Gates has said:

136
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:12,016
"Success is a lousy teacher.

137
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,614
It seduces us into thinking
we cannot fail."

138
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,367
That's the challenge with success.

139
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:23,340
So I think there are some lessons,
and I think they apply to us.

140
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,105
And they apply to our companies.

141
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,960
The first lesson is:
get ahead of the crisis.

142
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,518
And any company that's able to innovate

143
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:36,338
is actually able to also buy
an insurance in the future.

144
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,572
Netflix -- they could so easily
have been content

145
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,460
with earlier generations of distribution,

146
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:45,041
but they always -- and I think
they will always --

147
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,040
keep pushing for the next battle.

148
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:49,937
I see other companies that say,

149
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:54,402
"I'll win the next innovation cycle,
whatever it takes."

150
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,517
Second one: think in multiple time scales.

151
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,256
I'll share a chart with you,

152
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,138
and I think it's a wonderful one.

153
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,174
Any company we look at,

154
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,997
taking a one-year perspective

155
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,298
and looking at the valuation
of the company,

156
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,701
innovation typically accounts
for only about 30 percent.

157
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,574
So when we think one year,

158
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:15,880
innovation isn't really that important.

159
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,058
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective
on the same company --

160
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:25,260
suddenly, innovation and ability
to renew account for 70 percent.

161
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,730
But companies can't choose.

162
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:31,660
They need to fund the journey
and lead the long term.

163
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,922
Third:

164
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,541
invite talent.

165
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,522
I don't think it's possible for any of us

166
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:43,076
to be able to balance exploration
and exploitation by ourselves.

167
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,806
I think it's a team sport.

168
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,219
I think we need to allow challenging.

169
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:53,163
I think the mark of a great company
is being open to be challenged,

170
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:57,410
and the mark of a good corporate board
is to constructively challenge.

171
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:01,870
I think that's also what
good parenting is about.

172
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,339
Last one: be skeptical of success.

173
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:12,466
Maybe it's useful to think back
at the old triumph marches in Rome,

174
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,986
when the generals, after a big victory,

175
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,361
were given their celebration.

176
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,489
Riding into Rome on the carriage,

177
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:25,735
they always had a companion
whispering in their ear,

178
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,245
"Remember, you're only human."

179
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,677
So I hope I made the point:

180
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,723
balancing exploration and exploitation

181
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,194
has a huge payoff.

182
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,779
But it's difficult,
and we need to be conscious.

183
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:44,783
I want to just point out two questions
that I think are useful.

184
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:48,801
First question is,
looking at your own company:

185
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:53,756
In which areas do you see
that the company is at the risk

186
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,024
of falling into success traps,

187
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:58,579
of just going on autopilot?

188
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:02,286
And what can you do to challenge?

189
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,242
Second question is:

190
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,791
When did I explore something new last,

191
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,068
and what kind of effect did it have on me?

192
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:15,028
Is that something I should do more of?

193
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:16,845
In my case, yes.

194
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,668
So let me leave you with this.

195
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,973
Whether you're an explorer by nature

196
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,899
or whether you tend to exploit
what you already know,

197
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:32,007
don't forget: the beauty
is in the balance.

198
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,552
Thank you.

199
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:37,197
(Applause)
