00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,370
As a conceptual artist,

1
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:18,702
I'm constantly looking for creative ways
to spark challenging conversations.

2
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:22,425
I do this though painting, sculpture,
video and performance.

3
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,888
But regardless of the format,

4
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:27,364
two of my favorite materials
are history and dialogue.

5
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,235
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"

6
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,033
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,

7
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:35,612
600-pound glass depiction
of a lotus blossom.

8
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:39,406
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
for transcendence

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,858
and for purity of mind and spirit.

10
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,303
But a closer look at this lotus

11
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:47,541
reveals each petal
to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

12
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:51,660
This iconic diagram was taken
from a British slaving manual

13
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,517
and later used by abolitionists to show
the atrocities of slavery.

14
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,509
In America, we don't like
to talk about slavery,

15
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:01,373
nor do we look at it as a global industry.

16
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:03,025
But by using this Buddhist symbol,

17
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,652
I hope to universalize and transcend

18
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,065
the history and trauma of black America

19
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:11,453
and encourage discussions
about our shared past.

20
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:16,128
To create "Lotus,"
we carved over 6,000 figures.

21
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,192
And this later led to a commission
by the City of New York

22
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,470
to create a 28-foot version in steel

23
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:24,936
as a permanent installation
at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,098
a school for black and latino students,

25
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,795
the two groups most affected
by this history.

26
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:33,795
The same two groups are very affected
by a more recent phenomenon,

27
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,442
but let me digress.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,007
I've been collecting
wooden African figures

29
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,515
from tourist shops and flea markets
around the world.

30
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,621
The authenticity and origin
of them is completely debatable,

31
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,303
but people believe these
to be imbued with power,

32
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,659
or even magic.

33
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:50,809
Only recently have I figured out
how to use this in my own work.

34
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:58,221
(Gun shots)

35
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:09,421
Since 2012, the world has witnessed
the killings of Trayvon Martin,

36
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:13,185
Michael Brown, Eric Garner,
Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice

37
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:16,169
and literally countless other
unarmed black citizens

38
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:17,622
at the hands of the police,

39
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:20,454
who frequently walk away
with no punishment at all.

40
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,804
In consideration of these victims

41
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,638
and the several times that even I,

42
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:27,135
a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,

43
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,623
have been targeted and harassed
at gunpoint by the police.

44
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:34,301
I created this body of work
simply entitled "BAM."

45
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,888
It was important to erase
the identity of each of these figures,

46
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:43,661
to make them all look the same
and easier to disregard.

47
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,885
To do this, I dip them in a thick,
brown wax

48
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,872
before taking them to a shooting range

49
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:50,694
where I re-sculpted them using bullets.

50
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,279
And it was fun,

51
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,140
playing with big guns and
high-speed video cameras.

52
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,821
But my reverence for these figures
kept me from actually pulling the trigger,

53
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,503
somehow feeling as if I would
be shooting myself.

54
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,225
Finally, my cameraman, Raul,
fired the shots.

55
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,372
I then took the fragments of these

56
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,924
and created molds,
and cast them first in wax,

57
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,852
and finally in bronze
like the image you see here,

58
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,980
which bears the marks
of its violent creation

59
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,812
like battle wounds or scars.

60
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,591
When I showed this work recently in Miami,

61
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:25,400
a woman told me she felt
every gun shot to her soul.

62
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:28,015
But she also felt that these artworks

63
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,039
memorialized the victims of these killings

64
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:33,252
as well as other victims of
racial violence throughout US history.

65
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,846
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger
than just US history.

66
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,734
While showing in Berlin last year,

67
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:42,319
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.

68
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,961
I showed him a photo
of a lynching postcard

69
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,350
from the early 1900s

70
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:51,446
and reminded him that these killings
have been going on for over 500 years.

71
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,828
But it's only through questions like his

72
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:56,694
and more thoughtful dialogue
about history and race

73
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,296
can we evolve as individuals and society.

74
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,542
I hope my artwork creates a safe space

75
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,978
for this type of honest exchange

76
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,741
and an opportunity for people
to engage one another

77
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,653
in real and necessary conversation.

78
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,901
Thank you.

79
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:18,388
(Applause)
