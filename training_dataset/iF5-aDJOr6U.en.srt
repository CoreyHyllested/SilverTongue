00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,881
Today, I am going to show you

1
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,334
how this tablet and this virtual-reality
headset that I'm wearing

2
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:23,399
are going to completely
revolutionize science education.

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,895
And I'm also going to show you

4
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:30,703
how it can make any science teacher
more than twice as effective.

5
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:34,588
But before I show you
how all of this is possible,

6
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:40,151
let's talk briefly about why improving
the quality of science education

7
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,615
is so vitally important.

8
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:44,674
If you think about it,

9
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,973
the world is growing incredibly fast.

10
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:51,207
And with that growth comes
a whole list of growing challenges,

11
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:54,244
challenges such as dealing
with global warming,

12
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:56,631
solving starvation and water shortages

13
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,107
and curing diseases,

14
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,656
to name just a few.

15
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:05,882
And who, exactly, is going to help us
solve all of these great challenges?

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,170
Well, to a very last degree,
it is these young students.

17
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:14,036
This is the next generation
of young, bright scientists.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,080
And in many ways, we all rely on them

19
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,906
for coming up with new, great innovations

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,641
to help us solve all
these challenges ahead of us.

21
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,659
And so a couple of years back,

22
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:31,042
my cofounder and I were teaching
university students just like these,

23
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:36,180
only the students we were teaching
looked a little bit more like this here.

24
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,268
(Laughter)

25
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:40,130
And yes, this is really
the reality out there

26
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,679
in way too many universities
around the world:

27
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,356
students that are bored, disengaged

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,985
and sometimes not even sure
why they're learning about a topic

29
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,208
in the first place.

30
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:56,097
So we started looking around for new,
innovative teaching methods,

31
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,944
but what we found was quite disappointing.

32
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:02,633
We saw that books were being
turned into e-books,

33
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:06,511
blackboards were being turned
into YouTube videos

34
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:09,679
and lecture hall monologues
were being turned into MOOCs --

35
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:12,004
massive online open courses.

36
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:13,941
And if you think about it,

37
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,548
all we're really doing here
is taking the same content

38
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,120
and the same format,

39
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:22,070
and bringing it out to more students --

40
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,403
which is great, don't get me
wrong, that is really great --

41
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:29,054
but the teaching method
is still more or less the same,

42
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,374
no real innovation there.

43
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,882
So we started looking elsewhere.

44
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:38,533
What we found was that flight simulators
had been proven over and over again

45
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,024
to be far more effective

46
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:45,314
when used in combination with real,
in-flight training to train the pilots.

47
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:46,963
And so we thought to ourselves:

48
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,869
Why not just apply that to science?

49
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:54,444
Why not build a virtual
laboratory simulator?

50
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:56,811
Well, we did it.

51
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,653
We basically set out to create

52
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:04,292
a fully simulated, one-to-one,
virtual reality laboratory simulator,

53
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,513
where the students
could perform experiments

54
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:08,447
with mathematical equations

55
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,690
that would simulate what would
happen in a real-world lab.

56
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:13,393
But not just simple simulations --

57
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,483
we would also create advanced simulations

58
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,431
with top universities like MIT,

59
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:21,824
to bring out cutting-edge cancer
research to these students.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,403
And suddenly, the universities
could save millions of dollars

61
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:28,357
by letting the students
perform virtual experiments

62
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,493
before they go into the real laboratory.

63
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,835
And not only that; now,
they could also understand --

64
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,292
even on a molecular level
inside the machine --

65
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,992
what is happening to the machines.

66
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,915
And then they could suddenly perform

67
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,567
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.

68
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,077
For instance also here,

69
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,713
learning about salmonella bacteria,
which is an important topic

70
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:53,708
that many schools cannot teach
for good safety reasons.

71
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:56,052
And we, of course, quiz the students

72
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,481
and then give the teachers
a full dashboard,

73
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,431
so they fully understand
where the students are at.

74
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,342
But we didn't stop there,

75
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,691
because we had seen just
how important meaning is

76
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:08,001
for the students' engagement in the class.

77
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,747
So we brought in game designers

78
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,652
to create fun and engaging stories.

79
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:14,510
For instance, here in this case,

80
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:18,657
where the students have to solve
a mysterious CSI murder case

81
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:21,375
using their core science skills.

82
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,305
And the feedback we got
when we launched all of this

83
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,281
was quite overwhelmingly positive.

84
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,108
Here we have 300 students,

85
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,847
all passionately solving CSI murder cases

86
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,736
while learning core science skills.

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,005
And what I love the most about this

88
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:40,673
is really when the students
come up to me sometimes afterwards,

89
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,812
all surprised and a little confused,

90
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:47,539
and say, "I just spent two hours
in this virtual lab,

91
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,611
and ... and I didn't check Facebook."

92
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:51,964
(Laughter)

93
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:56,639
That's how engaging and immersive
this really is for the students.

94
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,483
And so, to investigate
whether this really worked,

95
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,910
a learning psychologist
did a study with 160 students --

96
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:08,180
that was from Stanford University
and Technical University of Denmark.

97
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:11,736
And what they did is split
the students into two groups.

98
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,011
One group would only use
the virtual laboratory simulations,

99
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:19,735
the other group would only use
traditional teaching methods,

100
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,674
and they had the same amount of time.

101
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,953
Then, interestingly,

102
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:27,644
they gave the students a test
before and after the experiment,

103
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:32,021
so they could clearly measure
the learning impact of the students.

104
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,213
And what they found

105
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:39,038
was a surprisingly high 76 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness

106
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:43,906
when using virtual laboratories
over traditional teaching methods.

107
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,834
But even more interestingly,

108
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:49,072
the second part of this study investigated

109
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:52,000
what the teacher's impact
was on the learning.

110
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:53,175
And what they found

111
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,861
was that when you combined
the virtual laboratories

112
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,489
with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,

113
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:04,329
then we saw a total 101 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness,

114
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:08,785
which effectively doubles
the science teacher's impact

115
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:11,167
with the same amount of time spent.

116
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:16,494
So a couple of months back,

117
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:18,031
we started asking ourselves --

118
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,602
we have a wonderful team now
of learning psychologists

119
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,982
and teachers and scientists
and game developers --

120
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:24,547
and we started asking ourselves:

121
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:27,166
How can we keep ourselves to our promise

122
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,154
of constantly reimagining education?

123
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:35,279
And today, I am really excited
to be presenting what we came up with

124
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,207
and have been working
incredibly hard to create.

125
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:42,861
I will explain briefly what this is.

126
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,621
Basically, I take my mobile phone --

127
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:48,351
most students already
have these, smartphones --

128
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:52,899
and I plug it into this virtual-reality
headset, a low-cost headset.

129
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,892
And now what I can effectively do is,

130
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,066
I can literally step
into this virtual world.

131
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,174
We'll have some of you
in the audience also get to try this,

132
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:04,354
because it is really something
that you have to try

133
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,673
to fully feel how immersive it really is.

134
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:10,474
It literally feels like I just stepped
inside this virtual lab.

135
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,001
Do you see me up on the screen?

136
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,176
Audience: Yes.

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,803
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.

138
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:17,725
So basically, I have just
turned my mobile phone

139
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:21,413
into a fully simulated, million-dollar
Ivy League laboratory

140
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:24,262
with all this amazing equipment
that I can interact with.

141
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:27,659
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette
and do experiments with it.

142
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,103
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR
and -- oh, look there,

143
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,648
I have my next-generation
sequencing machine,

144
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:36,170
and there I even have
my electron microscope.

145
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,624
I mean, who's carrying around
an electron microscope in their pocket?

146
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:41,520
And here I have my machine,

147
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,714
I can do different experiments
on the machine.

148
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,192
And over here I have the door,

149
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,584
I can go into other experiments,

150
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,541
I can perform in the laboratories.

151
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:51,771
And here, I have my learning tablet.

152
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,249
This is an intelligent tablet

153
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,121
that allows me to read
about relevant theory.

154
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:58,447
As you can see, I can interact with it.

155
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:02,365
I can watch videos and see
content that is relevant

156
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,254
to the experiment
that I'm performing right now.

157
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,477
Then over here, I have Marie.

158
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:11,020
She is my teacher --
my lab assistant --

159
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:14,221
and what she does is guides me
through this whole laboratory.

160
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,404
And very soon,

161
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,396
the teachers will be able
to literally teleport themselves

162
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,979
into this virtual world
that I'm in right now

163
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:24,233
and help me, guide me,
through this whole experiment.

164
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,567
And now before I finalize this,

165
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,559
I want to show you
an even cooler thing, I think --

166
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,619
something you cannot
even do in real laboratories.

167
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:33,881
This is a PCR machine.

168
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,385
I'm now going to start this experiment.

169
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,642
And what I just did is literally
shrunk myself a million times

170
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,225
into the size of a molecule --

171
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,598
and it really feels like it,
you have to try this.

172
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:47,225
So now it feels like
I'm standing inside the machine

173
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:49,842
and I'm seeing all the DNA,
and I see the molecules.

174
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:53,469
I see the polymerase
and the enzymes and so forth.

175
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,096
And I can see how in this case,

176
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,197
DNA is being replicated millions of times,

177
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,054
just like it's happening
inside your body right now.

178
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,205
And I can really feel and understand
how all of this works.

179
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,513
Now, I hope that gives you
a little bit of a sense

180
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:13,663
of the possibilities
in these new teaching methods.

181
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,572
And I want to also emphasize

182
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:21,287
that everything you just saw
also works on iPads and laptops

183
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,482
without the headsets.

184
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:24,870
I say that for a very important reason.

185
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:28,879
In order for us to really
empower and inspire

186
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,071
the next generation of scientists,

187
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:34,619
we really need teachers
to drive the adoption

188
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,218
of new technologies in the classroom.

189
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,420
And so in many ways,

190
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:44,799
I believe that the next big,
quantum leap in science education

191
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,132
lies no longer with the technology,

192
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,037
but rather with the teachers' decision

193
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:52,266
to push forward and adopt
these technologies

194
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,037
inside the classrooms.

195
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,898
And so it is our hope that more
universities and schools and teachers

196
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:00,787
will collaborate with technology companies

197
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,335
to realize this full potential.

198
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,434
And so,

199
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,291
lastly, I'd like to leave you
with a little story

200
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:10,877
that really inspires me.

201
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,322
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.

202
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,108
Some of you might already know him.

203
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:22,124
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking
low-cost test for pancreatic cancer

204
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:24,569
at the age 15.

205
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,497
And when Jack shares his story
of how he did this huge breakthrough,

206
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,346
he also explains that one thing
almost prevented him

207
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,163
from making this breakthrough.

208
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:40,603
And that was that he did not
have access to real laboratories,

209
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:43,156
because he was too inexperienced

210
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,621
to be allowed in.

211
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,055
Now, imagine if we could bring

212
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,348
Ivy League, million-dollar
virtual laboratories

213
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:53,443
out to all these students just like Jack,

214
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,074
all over the world,

215
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:58,654
and give them the latest, greatest,
most fancy machines you can imagine

216
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:01,224
that would quite literally
make any scientist in here

217
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,721
jump up and down out of pure excitement.

218
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:08,355
And then imagine how that
would empower and inspire

219
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,558
a whole new generation
of young and bright scientists,

220
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,785
ready to innovate and change the world.

221
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,338
Thank you very much.

222
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:25,425
(Applause)
