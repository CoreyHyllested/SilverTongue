00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,851
This is a map of New York State

1
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,393
that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.

2
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,914
It's an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,

3
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,659
because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,

4
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,562
there is a little town called Roscoe --

5
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,284
actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here --

6
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:32,838
There's Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,

7
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:36,675
and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

8
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,758
Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,

9
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:42,058
because it's a paper town.

10
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,304
It's also known as a copyright trap.

11
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:47,682
Mapmakers -- because my map of New York
and your map of New York

12
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:51,372
are going to look very similar,
on account of the shape of New York --

13
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:56,169
often, mapmakers will insert
fake places onto their maps,

14
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:57,955
in order to protect their copyright.

15
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:00,867
Because then, if my fake place
shows up on your map,

16
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:04,546
I can be well and truly sure
that you have robbed me.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,211
Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
of the two guys who made this map,

18
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,156
Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,456
and they released this map in 1937.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,799
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map

21
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:22,847
with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection

22
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,139
of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:29,466
Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,702
They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,

25
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,320
"We've caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.

26
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,398
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.

27
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:40,123
We're going to sue your pants off!"

28
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:45,490
And Rand McNally says,
"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."

29
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:51,160
Because people kept going
to that intersection of two dirt roads --

30
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:52,208
(Laughter)

31
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:56,728
in the middle of nowhere, expecting
there to be a place called Agloe --

32
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,985
someone built a place
called Agloe, New York.

33
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,048
(Laughter)

34
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:04,453
It had a gas station, a general store,
two houses at its peak.

35
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:06,747
(Laughter)

36
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:12,074
And this is of course a completely
irresistible metaphor to a novelist,

37
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,709
because we would all like to believe
that the stuff that we write down on paper

38
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,525
can change the actual world
in which we're actually living,

39
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,938
which is why my third book
is called "Paper Towns".

40
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:26,501
But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,

41
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,906
is the phenomenon itself.

42
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:33,598
It's easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?

43
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:38,049
Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.

44
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:41,818
But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way

45
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:45,383
that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.

46
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:50,563
Because the world would truly be
a different place if North were down.

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,765
And the world would be
a truly different place

48
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,808
if Alaska and Russia weren't
on opposite sides of the map.

49
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,758
And the world would be a different place

50
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,942
if we projected Europe
to show it in its actual size.

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,083
The world is changed
by our maps of the world.

52
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,265
The way that we choose -- sort of,
our personal cartographic enterprise,

53
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:13,924
also shapes the map of our lives,

54
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,066
and that in turn shapes our lives.

55
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,745
I believe that what we map
changes the life we lead.

56
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,183
And I don't mean that in some, like,
secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,

57
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:28,177
you-can-think-your-way-
out-of-cancer sense.

58
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:34,734
But I do believe that while maps don't
show you where you will go in your life,

59
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,749
they show you where you might go.

60
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:41,246
You very rarely go to a place
that isn't on your personal map.

61
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,968
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.

62
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,664
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.

63
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:51,296
And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,475
is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles

65
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,656
that had been erected before me,

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,307
and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.

67
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,815
And I didn't really want
to jump over these hurdles,

68
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,773
because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,

69
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,874
and then people would
threaten me, you know,

70
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,827
they'd threaten me with this
"going on [my] permanent record,"

71
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,060
or "You'll never get a good job."

72
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,563
I didn't want a good job!

73
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,599
As far as I could tell at eleven
or twelve years old,

74
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:20,775
like, people with good jobs woke up
very early in the morning,

75
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,804
(Laughter)

76
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:27,400
and the men who had good jobs,
one of the first things they did

77
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:31,347
was tie a strangulation item
of clothing around their necks.

78
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,972
They literally put nooses on themselves,

79
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,722
and then they went off to their jobs,
whatever they were.

80
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,485
That's not a recipe for a happy life.

81
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,837
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
twelve year-old imagination --

82
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,420
these people who are strangling themselves

83
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,800
as one of the first things
they do each morning,

84
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,584
they can't possibly be happy.

85
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,020
Why would I want to jump
over all of these hurdles

86
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,044
and have that be the end?

87
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,235
That's a terrible end!

88
00:04:57,454 --> 00:05:00,632
And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,

89
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:03,418
Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,

90
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:05,252
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.

91
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:08,791
And all at once I became a learner.

92
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,011
And I became a learner,
because I found myself

93
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,059
in a community of learners.

94
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,846
I found myself surrounded by people

95
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,100
who celebrated intellectualism
and engagement,

96
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:22,297
and who thought that my ironic
oh-so-cool disengagement

97
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,175
wasn't clever, or funny,

98
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,961
but, like, it was a simple
and unspectacular response

99
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,259
to very complicated
and compelling problems.

100
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:33,185
And so I started to learn,
because learning was cool.

101
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,512
I learned that some infinite sets
are bigger than other infinite sets,

102
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,630
and I learned that iambic pentameter is
and why it sounds so good to human ears.

103
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:44,096
I learned that the Civil War
was a nationalizing conflict,

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,287
I learned some physics,

105
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,467
I learned that correlation shouldn't be
confused with causation --

106
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,284
all of these things, by the way,

107
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,560
enriched my life
on a literally daily basis.

108
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:58,170
And it's true that I don't use
most of them for my "job,"

109
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,108
but that's not what it's about for me.

110
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:02,083
It's about cartography.

111
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,368
What is the process of cartography?

112
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:07,553
It's, you know, sailing
upon some land, and thinking,

113
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,678
"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"

114
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,025
and then wondering, "Maybe there's
some more land to draw."

115
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:15,256
And that's when learning
really began for me.

116
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,916
It's true that I had teachers
that didn't give up on me,

117
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,258
and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,

118
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:24,456
because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.

119
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:28,030
But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school

120
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,233
wasn't about what happened
inside the classroom,

121
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,715
it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.

122
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,096
For instance, I can tell you

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,953
that "There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons --

124
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,430
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --"

125
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:43,770
not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school

126
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,070
when I was in high school,

127
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,689
but because there was a girl
when I was in high school,

128
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:50,200
and her name was Amanda,
and I had a crush on her,

129
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,598
and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.

130
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,306
The reason I can tell you
what opportunity cost is,

131
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,982
is because one day when I was playing
Super Mario Kart on my couch,

132
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:00,878
my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,

133
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:03,260
"How long have you been playing
Super Mario Kart?"

134
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,754
And I said, "I don't know,
like, six hours?" and he said,

135
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:10,146
"Do you realize that if you'd worked
at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,

136
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,428
you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,

137
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,372
you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart."

138
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,654
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."

139
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,027
(Laughter)

140
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:23,976
But I learned what opportunity cost is.

141
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,761
And along the way, the map
of my life got better.

142
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:31,642
It got bigger; it contained more places.

143
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,631
There were more things that might happen,

144
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,614
more futures I might have.

145
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:39,949
It wasn't a formal, organized
learning process,

146
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,704
and I'm happy to admit that.

147
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,860
It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.

148
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:47,178
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea

149
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:50,035
that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,

150
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:52,956
but I didn't really understand
the calculus behind that idea.

151
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,995
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,

152
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,329
but I didn't know the law
of diminishing returns.

153
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:00,326
But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,

154
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,438
instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles

155
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,820
that you have to jump over,

156
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:07,316
is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.

157
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,777
And so now I do know
at least some of the calculus

158
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,533
that underlies all of that stuff.

159
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,327
So, I had one learning community

160
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,965
in high school, then I went
to another for college,

161
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,289
and then I went to another,

162
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,909
when I started working
at a magazine called "Booklist,"

163
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,286
where I was an assistant, surrounded
by astonishingly well-read people.

164
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,836
And then I wrote a book.

165
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,060
And like all authors dream of doing,

166
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,013
I promptly quit my job.

167
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,626
(Laughter)

168
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,626
And for the first time since high school,

169
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,253
I found myself without a learning
community, and it was miserable.

170
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,711
I hated it.

171
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,109
I read many, many books
during this two-year period.

172
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,896
I read books about Stalin,

173
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,411
and books about how the Uzbek people
came to identify as Muslims,

174
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,785
and I read books about
how to make atomic bombs,

175
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,958
but it just felt like I was
creating my own hurdles,

176
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:56,338
and then jumping over them myself,
instead of feeling the excitement

177
00:08:56,362 --> 00:09:00,011
of being part of a community of learners,
a community of people

178
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:03,018
who are engaged together
in the cartographic enterprise

179
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,598
of trying to better understand
and map the world around us.

180
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,068
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.

181
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,243
His name is Ze Frank.

182
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,904
I didn't actually meet him,
just on the Internet.

183
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:19,458
Ze Frank was running, at the time,
a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"

184
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:20,956
and I discovered the show,

185
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,214
and that was my way back
into being a community learner again.

186
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,393
Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:

187
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:31,342
(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
in the middle of a huge, hot desert.

188
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,062
Almost everything here was brought
from somewhere else --

189
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,262
the sort of rocks, the trees,
the waterfalls.

190
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:39,295
These fish are almost as out of place
as my pig that flew.

191
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:42,185
Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,

192
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,363
so are these people.

193
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:47,318
Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,

194
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:50,090
and away from the people
that experience them differently.

195
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:53,294
Sometimes improvements were made --
even the Sphinx got a nose job.

196
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:56,209
Here, there's no reason to feel
like you're missing anything.

197
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,203
This New York means the same to me
as it does to everyone else.

198
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,784
Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:

199
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,738
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.

200
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:08,360
This fabrication of place could be one
of the world's greatest achievements,

201
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,405
because no one belongs here;
everyone does.

202
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:13,453
As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings

203
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:16,217
were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.

204
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,402
But unlike most mirrors,

205
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,801
which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,

206
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,270
these mirrors come back empty.

207
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:24,473
John Green: Makes me
nostalgic for the days

208
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,679
when you could see
the pixels in online video.

209
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:27,710
(Laughter)

210
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:31,820
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
he's also a brilliant community builder,

211
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,705
and the community of people
that built up around these videos

212
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,741
was in many ways a community of learners.

213
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:40,289
So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.

214
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:44,726
We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.

215
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,701
We turned the Earth into a sandwich,

216
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:50,434
by having one person hold a piece of bread
at one point on the Earth,

217
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,587
and on the exact opposite
point of the Earth,

218
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,123
have another person
holding a piece of bread.

219
00:10:55,593 --> 00:11:01,601
I realize that these are silly ideas,
but they are also "learny" ideas,

220
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,547
and that was what was so exciting to me,

221
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:07,161
and if you go online, you can find
communities like this all over the place.

222
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,066
Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,

223
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,741
and yes, you will see people
complaining about calculus,

224
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:14,435
but you'll also see people
re-blogging those complaints,

225
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,643
making the argument that calculus
is interesting and beautiful,

226
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:21,620
and here's a way in to thinking about
the problem that you find unsolvable.

227
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:24,240
You can go to places like Reddit,
and find sub-Reddits,

228
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:26,882
like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"

229
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:30,137
where you can ask people
who are in these fields

230
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,629
a wide range of questions,

231
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,994
from very serious ones to very silly ones.

232
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,950
But to me, the most interesting
communities of learners

233
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:39,837
that are growing up on the Internet
right now are on YouTube,

234
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,457
and admittedly, I am biased.

235
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:46,015
But I think in a lot of ways,
the YouTube page resembles a classroom.

236
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,863
Look for instance at "Minute Physics,"

237
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,680
a guy who's teaching
the world about physics:

238
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,205
(Video) Let's cut to the chase.

239
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:55,587
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
is the last fundamental piece

240
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:59,091
of the standard model of particle physics
to be discovered experimentally.

241
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,169
But, you might ask,
why was the Higgs boson

242
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:02,679
included in the standard model,

243
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,973
alongside well-known particles
like electrons and photons and quarks,

244
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:08,517
if it hadn't been discovered
back then in the 1970s?

245
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,541
Good question. There are two main reasons.

246
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:13,824
First, just like the electron
is an excitation in the electron field,

247
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,642
the Higgs boson is simply a particle
which is an excitation

248
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,649
of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.

249
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,917
The Higgs field in turn
plays an integral role

250
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,870
in our model for the weak nuclear force.

251
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:26,054
In particular, the Higgs field
helps explain why it's so weak.

252
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,142
We'll talk more about this
in a later video,

253
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,000
but even though weak nuclear theory was
confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,

254
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,736
the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
with the weak force, that until now

255
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,927
we've been unable to confirm
its actual and independent existence.

256
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,726
JG: Or here's a video that I made

257
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,959
as part of my show "Crash Course,"
talking about World War I:

258
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:47,354
(Video) The immediate cause was
of course the assassination in Sarajevo

259
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:49,389
of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

260
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:53,839
on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.

261
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,305
Quick aside: It's worth noting

262
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:57,821
that the first big war
of the twentieth century began

263
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,066
with an act of terrorism.

264
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,421
So Franz Ferdinand
wasn't particularly well-liked

265
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:05,079
by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --
now that is a mustache!

266
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:08,878
But even so, the assassination led Austria
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

267
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:12,114
whereupon Serbia accepted some,
but not all, of Austria's demands,

268
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,698
leading Austria to declare
war against Serbia.

269
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:18,103
And then Russia, due to its alliance
with the Serbs, mobilized its army.

270
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,437
Germany, because it had
an alliance with Austria,

271
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,958
told Russia to stop mobilizing,

272
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:25,241
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army,

273
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,334
declared war on Russia,
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,

274
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:31,937
and then declared war on France,
because, you know, France.

275
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:35,414
(Laughter)

276
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,682
And it's not just physics
and world history

277
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,838
that people are choosing
to learn through YouTube.

278
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,240
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.

279
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:48,598
(Video) So you're me, and you're
in math class yet again,

280
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,624
because they make you go every single day.

281
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,915
And you're learning about, I don't know,
the sums of infinite series.

282
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,565
That's a high school topic, right?

283
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,505
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

284
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,687
So I guess that's why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.

285
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,863
So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you're doodling

286
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,819
and thinking more about what
the plural of "series" should be

287
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:12,485
than about the topic at hand: "serieses,"
"seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"

288
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:15,808
Or is it that the singular should be
changed: one "serie," or "serum,"

289
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:18,276
just like the singular of "sheep"
should be "shoop."

290
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,793
But the whole concept of things

291
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,278
like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
approaches one, is useful if, say,

292
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,065
you want to draw a line of elephants,

293
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,905
each holding the tail of the next one:

294
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:30,097
normal elephant, young elephant,
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,

295
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,092
puppy-sized elephant, all the way
down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.

296
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:34,897
Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,

297
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,868
because you can get an infinite number
of elephants in a line,

298
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,345
and still have it fit across
a single notebook page.

299
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,991
JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
from "Smarter Every Day,"

300
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,424
talking about the conservation
of angular momentum,

301
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:46,925
and, since it's YouTube, cats:

302
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,060
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

303
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:53,426
So you've probably observed that cats
almost always land on their feet.

304
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,410
Today's question is: why?

305
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:58,190
Like most simple questions,
there's a very complex answer.

306
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,224
For instance, let me reword this question:

307
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:05,443
How does a cat go from feet-up
to feet-down in a falling reference frame,

308
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:08,432
without violating the conservation
of angular momentum?

309
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:09,467
(Laughter)

310
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,968
JG: So, here's something all four
of these videos have in common:

311
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:16,516
They all have more than half
a million views on YouTube.

312
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,609
And those are people watching
not in classrooms,

313
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:23,274
but because they are part
of the communities of learning

314
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,313
that are being set up by these channels.

315
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,417
And I said earlier that YouTube
is like a classroom to me,

316
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,124
and in many ways it is,
because here is the instructor --

317
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:34,166
it's like the old-fashioned classroom:
here's the instructor,

318
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,513
and then beneath the instructor
are the students,

319
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,608
and they're all having a conversation.

320
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:42,661
And I know that YouTube comments
have a very bad reputation

321
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,080
in the world of the Internet,

322
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:47,175
but in fact, if you go on comments
for these channels,

323
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,354
what you'll find is people engaging
the subject matter,

324
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:54,625
asking difficult, complicated questions
that are about the subject matter,

325
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,387
and then other people
answering those questions.

326
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:02,245
And because the YouTube page is set up so
that the page in which I'm talking to you

327
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,112
is on the exact -- the place where I'm
talking to you is on the exact same page

328
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,294
as your comments,

329
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:12,950
you are participating in a live and real
and active way in the conversation.

330
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:16,545
And because I'm in comments usually,
I get to participate with you.

331
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:19,023
And you find this
whether it's world history,

332
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,109
or mathematics, or science,
or whatever it is.

333
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:27,751
You also see young people using the tools
and the sort of genres of the Internet

334
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:30,852
in order to create places
for intellectual engagement,

335
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,476
instead of the ironic detachment

336
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,197
that maybe most of us associate with memes
and other Internet conventions --

337
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,745
you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."

338
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,220
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo
criticizing industrial capitalism:

339
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,910
["Liberal capitalism is not at all
the Good of humanity.

340
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:49,493
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle
of savage, destructive nihilism."]

341
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,801
In case you can't see
what she says ... yeah.

342
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,982
I really believe that these spaces,

343
00:16:56,006 --> 00:17:01,039
these communities, have become
for a new generation of learners,

344
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:05,428
the kind of communities,
the kind of cartographic communities

345
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:09,995
that I had when I was in high school,
and then again when I was in college.

346
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,288
And as an adult, re-finding
these communities

347
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:16,622
has re-introduced me
to a community of learners,

348
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:21,544
and has encouraged me to continue
to be a learner even in my adulthood,

349
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:26,279
so that I no longer feel like learning
is something reserved for the young.

350
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,526
Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me

351
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,350
to all kinds of things
that I didn't know before.

352
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,433
And I know that we all hearken back

353
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:36,543
to the days of the Parisian salon
in the Enlightenment,

354
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,596
or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,

355
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,745
"Oh, I wish I could have been
a part of that,

356
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,614
I wish I could have laughed
at Dorothy Parker's jokes."

357
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:48,416
But I'm here to tell you that these places
exist, they still exist.

358
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,969
They exist in corners of the Internet,
where old men fear to tread.

359
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:53,996
(Laughter)

360
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,845
And I truly, truly believe that when
we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,

361
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:04,667
when we made Agloe real,
we were just getting started.

362
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,398
Thank you.

363
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:09,003
(Applause)
