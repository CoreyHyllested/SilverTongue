0
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:17,553
What does it mean to spend our time well?

1
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,982
I spend a lot of my time

2
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,616
thinking about how to spend my time.

3
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,201
Probably too much --
I probably obsess over it.

4
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,670
My friends think I do.

5
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:35,181
But I feel like I kind of have to,
because these days,

6
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:39,086
it feels like little bits of my time
kind of slip away from me,

7
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,628
and when that happens, it feels like
parts of my life are slipping away.

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,237
Specifically,

9
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,110
it feels like little bits
of my time get slipped away

10
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:50,738
to various things like this,

11
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:52,729
like technology -- I check things.

12
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:54,804
I'll give you an example.

13
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,577
If this email shows up --

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,286
how many of you have gotten
an email like this, right?

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,608
I've been tagged in a photo.

16
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:05,487
When this appears,

17
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:08,922
I can't help but click on it right now.

18
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,487
Right? Because, like,
what if it's a bad photo?

19
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,216
So I have to click it right now.

20
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:16,029
But I'm not just going
to click "See photo,"

21
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,951
what I'm actually going to do
is spend the next 20 minutes.

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,152
(Laughter)

23
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:24,213
But the worst part is that I know
this is what's going to happen,

24
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:27,682
and even knowing
that's what's going to happen

25
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:30,522
doesn't stop me
from doing it again the next time.

26
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:34,633
Or I find myself in a situation like this,

27
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,671
where I check my email
and I pull down to refresh,

28
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,515
But the thing is that 60 seconds later,

29
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,670
I'll pull down to refresh again.

30
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,947
Why am I doing this?

31
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:53,779
This doesn't make any sense.

32
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,508
But I'll give you a hint
why this is happening.

33
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:04,865
What do you think makes
more money in the United States

34
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:11,221
than movies, game parks
and baseball combined?

35
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,983
Slot machines.

36
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:19,892
How can slot machines make all this money

37
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,583
when we play with such small
amounts of money?

38
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,680
We play with coins.

39
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:28,979
How is this possible?

40
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,082
Well, the thing is ...

41
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,575
my phone is a slot machine.

42
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,797
Every time I check my phone,

43
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,138
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

44
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,354
what am I going to get?

45
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,085
What am I going to get?

46
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,950
Every time I check my email,

47
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,426
I'm playing the slot machine,

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,061
saying, "What am I going to get?"

49
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,806
Every time I scroll a news feed,

50
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,276
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,882
what am I going to get next?

52
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,497
And the thing is that,

53
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:02,613
again, knowing exactly
how this works -- and I'm a designer,

54
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,914
I know exactly how
the psychology of this works,

55
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,793
I know exactly what's going on --

56
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,059
but it doesn't leave me with any choice,

57
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,134
I still just get sucked into it.

58
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,983
So what are we going to do?

59
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:18,012
Because it leaves us
with this all-or-nothing relationship

60
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,516
with technology, right?

61
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,016
You're either on,

62
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,885
and you're connected
and distracted all the time,

63
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,759
or you're off,

64
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:28,037
but then you're wondering,

65
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,686
am I missing something important?

66
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:32,606
In other words, you're either distracted

67
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,504
or you have fear of missing out.

68
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:37,520
Right?

69
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,924
So we need to restore choice.

70
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,462
We want to have
a relationship with technology

71
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:50,692
that gives us back choice
about how we spend time with it,

72
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,773
and we're going to need
help from designers,

73
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:57,467
because knowing this stuff doesn't help.

74
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,543
We're going to need design help.

75
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,494
So what would that look like?

76
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:05,463
So let's take an example that we all face:

77
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,533
chat -- text messaging.

78
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,666
So let's say there's two people.

79
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,846
Nancy's on the left
and she's working on a document,

80
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,077
and John's on the right.

81
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,306
And John suddenly remembers,

82
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,933
"I need to ask Nancy
for that document before I forget."

83
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,958
So when he sends her that message,

84
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:26,068
it blows away her attention.

85
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:30,844
That's what we're doing all the time,
bulldozing each other's attention,

86
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,282
left and right.

87
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,072
And there's serious cost to this,

88
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:37,165
because every time
we interrupt each other,

89
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,976
it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
to refocus our attention.

91
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:47,212
We actually cycle through
two different projects

92
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:49,945
before we come back
to the original thing we were doing.

93
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:55,147
This is Gloria Mark's research
combined with Microsoft research,

94
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,529
that showed this.

95
00:04:56,553 --> 00:05:00,508
And her research also shows
that it actually trains bad habits.

96
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,977
The more interruptions we get externally,

97
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:07,762
it's conditioning and training us
to interrupt ourselves.

98
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,883
We actually self-interrupt
every three-and-a-half minutes.

99
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,327
This is crazy.

100
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,652
So how do we fix this?

101
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:18,926
Because Nancy and John are in this
all-or-nothing relationship.

102
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,451
Nancy might want to disconnect,

103
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,828
but then she'd be worried:

104
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:23,903
What if I'm missing something important?

105
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:26,259
Design can fix this problem.

106
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,344
Let's say you have
Nancy again on the left,

107
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:30,540
John on the right.

108
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,255
And John remembers,
"I need to send Nancy that document."

109
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,508
Except this time,

110
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,469
Nancy can mark that she's focused.

111
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,461
Let's say she drags a slider and says,

112
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,408
"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"

113
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:41,867
so -- bam -- she's focused.

114
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:45,391
Now when John wants to message her,

115
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:47,542
he can get the thought off of his mind --

116
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:49,639
because he has a need,
he has this thought,

117
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,090
and he needs to dump it out
before he forgets.

118
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:54,266
Except this time,

119
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,594
it holds the messages
so that Nancy can still focus,

120
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:01,161
but John can get the thought
off of his mind.

121
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,074
But this only works
if one last thing is true,

122
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:10,584
which is that Nancy needs to know
that if something is truly important,

123
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,242
John can still interrupt.

124
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:20,271
But instead of having constant
accidental or mindless interruptions,

125
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,977
we're now only creating
conscious interruptions,

126
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,506
So we're doing two things here.

127
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,632
We're creating a new choice
for both Nancy and John,

128
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:33,242
But there's a second, subtle thing
we're doing here, too.

129
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:37,151
And it's that we're changing
the question we're answering.

130
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:40,910
Instead of the goal of chat being:

131
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:45,253
"Let's design it so it's easy
to send a message" --

132
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,707
that's the goal of chat,

133
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,426
it should be really easy to send
a message to someone --

134
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,888
we change the goal to something
deeper and a human value,

135
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,116
which is: "Let's create the highest
possible quality communication

136
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,623
in a relationship between two people.

137
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,027
So we upgraded the goal.

138
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,643
Now, do designers
actually care about this?

139
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:11,696
Do we want to have conversations
about what these deeper human goals are?

140
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:14,297
Well, I'll tell you one story.

141
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,391
A little over a year ago,

142
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,495
I got to help organize a meeting

143
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,391
between some of technology's leading
designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.

144
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:31,134
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international
spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.

145
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,909
And it was the most amazing meeting.

146
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,953
You have to imagine -- picture a room --

147
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:38,830
on one side of the room,
you have a bunch of tech geeks;

148
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,350
on the other side of the room,

149
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:45,355
you have a bunch of long brown robes,
shaved heads, Buddhist monks.

150
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:49,673
And the questions were about
the deepest human values,

151
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:52,015
like what does the future
of technology look like

152
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,254
when you're designing
for the deepest questions

153
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:55,761
and the deepest human values?

154
00:07:56,445 --> 00:08:00,135
And our conversation centered
on listening more deeply

155
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,087
to what those values might be.

156
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,636
He joked in our conversation

157
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,608
that what if, instead of a spell check,

158
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,582
you had a compassion check,

159
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:13,969
meaning, you might highlight a word
that might be accidentally abrasive --

160
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,907
perceived as abrasive by someone else.

161
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:20,815
So does this kind of conversation
happen in the real world,

162
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,961
not just in these design meetings?

163
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,092
Well, the answer is yes,

164
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:27,413
and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.

165
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,866
If you didn't know,
Couchsurfing is a website

166
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,775
that matches people
who are looking for a place to stay

167
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,670
with a free couch, from someone
who's trying to offer it.

168
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,728
So, great service --

169
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,416
what would their design goal be?

170
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,187
What are you designing
for if you work at Couchsurfing?

171
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:48,735
Well, you would think
it's to match guests with hosts.

172
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:50,739
Right?

173
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,018
That's a pretty good goal.

174
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,961
But that would kind of be like
our goal with messaging before,

175
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,350
where we're just trying
to deliver a message.

176
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,516
So what's the deeper, human goal?

177
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,120
Well, they set their goal

178
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:07,798
as the need to create lasting,
positive experiences and relationships

179
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,981
between people who've never met before.

180
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,926
And the most amazing thing
about this was in 2007,

181
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,591
they introduced a way to measure this,

182
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:18,066
which is incredible.

183
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,397
I'll tell you how it works.

184
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:20,968
For every design goal you have,

185
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:23,060
you have to have
a corresponding measurement

186
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,633
to know how you're doing --

187
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:25,992
a way of measuring success.

188
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:27,312
So what they do is,

189
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,779
let's say you take two people who meet up,

190
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,765
and they take the number of days
those two people spent together,

191
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,480
and then they estimate how many
hours were in those days --

192
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,953
how many hours did
those two people spend together?

193
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:46,112
And then after they spend
that time together,

194
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,326
they ask both of them:

195
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,308
How positive was your experience?

196
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:52,381
Did you have a good experience
with this person that you met?

197
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:56,322
And they subtract
from those positive hours

198
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,663
the amount of time
people spent on the website,

199
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:03,139
because that's a cost to people's lives.

200
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,426
Why should we value that as success?

201
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,522
And what you were left with

202
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:12,287
is something they refer to as "net
orchestrated conviviality,"

203
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,993
or, really, just a net
"Good Times" created.

204
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:20,049
The net hours that would have never
existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.

205
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,759
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be
to come to work every day

206
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:26,276
and measure your success

207
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,329
in the actual net new contribution
of hours in people's lives

208
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:33,954
that are positive,
that would have never existed

209
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:36,788
if you didn't do what you were
about to do at work today?

210
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:42,672
Can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way?

211
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:46,319
Can you imagine a social network that --

212
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,926
let's say you care about cooking,

213
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,981
and it measured its success
in terms of cooking nights organized

214
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:53,970
and the cooking articles
that you were glad you read,

215
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,971
and subtracted from that the articles
you weren't glad you read

216
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,558
or the time you spent scrolling
that you didn't like?

217
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,505
Imagine a professional social network

218
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,444
that, instead of measuring its success
in terms of connections created

219
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,057
or messages sent,

220
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:13,393
instead measured its success in terms
of the job offers that people got

221
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,246
that they were excited to get.

222
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:19,919
And subtracted the amount of time
people spent on the website.

223
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:23,678
Or imagine dating services,

224
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,440
like maybe Tinder or something,

225
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:28,942
where instead of measuring the number
of swipes left and right people did,

226
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,050
which is how they measure success today,

227
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:37,219
instead measured the deep, romantic,
fulfilling connections people created.

228
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,672
Whatever that was for them, by the way.

229
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:47,114
But can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way,

230
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,390
that was helping you spend your time well?

231
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,038
Now to do this you also need a new system,

232
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,740
because you're probably thinking,

233
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,319
today's Internet economy --

234
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:57,776
today's economy in general --

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,070
is measured in time spent.

236
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,141
The more users you have,

237
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,543
the more usage you have,

238
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,885
the more time people spend,

239
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,567
that's how we measure success.

240
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,351
But we've solved this problem before.

241
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:11,901
We solved it with organic,

242
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:14,859
when we said we need
to value things a different way.

243
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,819
We said this is a different kind of food.

244
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,116
So we can't compare it
just based on price;

245
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,980
this is a different category of food.

246
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:25,737
We solved it with Leed Certification,

247
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,208
where we said this
is a different kind of building

248
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:33,379
that stood for different values
of environmental sustainability.

249
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,548
What if we had something
like that for technology?

250
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:44,969
What if we had something
whose entire purpose and goal

251
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:49,266
was to help create net new positive
contributions to human life?

252
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,326
And what if we could
value it a different way,

253
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,848
so it would actually work?

254
00:12:56,634 --> 00:13:00,565
Imagine you gave this different
premium shelf space on app stores.

255
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,924
Imagine you had web browsers
that helped route you

256
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,422
to these kinds of design products.

257
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:11,973
Can you imagine how exciting it would be
to live and create that world?

258
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,932
We can create this world today.

259
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:19,750
Company leaders, all you have to do --

260
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:22,662
only you can prioritize a new metric,

261
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:27,549
which is your metric for net positive
contribution to human life.

262
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,624
And have an honest
conversation about that.

263
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,809
Maybe you're not
doing so well to start with,

264
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,524
but let's start that conversation.

265
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:40,730
Designers, you can redefine success;
you can redefine design.

266
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,687
Arguably, you have more power
than many people in your organization

267
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,634
to create the choices
that all of us live by.

268
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,712
Maybe like in medicine,

269
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,594
where we have a Hippocratic oath

270
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:55,740
to recognize the responsibility
and this higher value

271
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,331
that we have to treat patients.

272
00:13:57,355 --> 00:13:59,395
What if designers had something like that,

273
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,251
in terms of this new kind of design?

274
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,673
And users, for all of us --

275
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:08,200
we can demand technology
that works this way.

276
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,843
Now it may seem hard,

277
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:15,264
but McDonald's didn't have salads
until the consumer demand was there.

278
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,722
Walmart didn't have organic food
until the consumer demand was there.

279
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:25,491
We have to demand
this new kind of technology.

280
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,475
And we can do that.

281
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:29,604
And doing that

282
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:33,145
would amount to shifting
from a world that's driven and run

283
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:35,739
entirely on time spent,

284
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:41,186
to world that's driven by time well spent.

285
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:45,656
I want to live in this world,

286
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,768
and I want this conversation to happen.

287
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,436
Let's start that conversation now.

288
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:52,858
Thank you.

289
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,777
(Applause)
