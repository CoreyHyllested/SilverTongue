0
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:14,552
I am a Hazara,

1
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:19,381
and the homeland
of my people is Afghanistan.

2
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,400
Like hundreds of thousands
of other Hazara kids,

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,164
I was born in exile.

4
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:29,366
The ongoing persecution
and operation against the Hazaras

5
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:33,963
forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.

6
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:38,374
This persecution has had a long history
going back to the late 1800s,

7
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:41,301
and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.

8
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,897
He killed 63 percent of
the Hazara population.

9
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:49,544
He built minarets with their heads.

10
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:51,911
Many Hazaras were sold into slavery,

11
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:58,204
and many others fled the country
for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.

12
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,920
My parents also fled to Pakistan,

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,916
and settled in Quetta, where I was born.

14
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,857
After the September 11
attack on the Twin Towers,

15
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,645
I got a chance to go to Afghanistan

16
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:11,223
for the first time,
with foreign journalists.

17
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:15,030
I was only 18, and I got a job
working as an interpreter.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,213
After four years,

19
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:21,903
I felt it was safe enough
to move to Afghanistan permanently,

20
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:26,523
and I was working there
as a documentary photographer,

21
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:30,769
and I worked on many stories.

22
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,373
One of the most important
stories that I did

23
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:38,087
was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.

24
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:42,591
It is a tragic story about
an appalling tradition.

25
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:46,052
It involves young kids
dancing for warlords

26
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:48,141
and powerful men in the society.

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,902
These boys are often abducted
or bought from their poor parents,

28
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,967
and they are put to work as sex slaves.

29
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,731
This is Shukur.

30
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:01,400
He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,372
He was taken to another province,

32
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:08,133
where he was forced to work as a sex slave
for the warlord and his friends.

33
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,058
When this story was published
in the Washington Post,

34
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:13,380
I started receiving death threats,

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,118
and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,

36
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,510
as my parents were.

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,202
Along with my family,
I returned back to Quetta.

38
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,614
The situation in Quetta had changed
dramatically since I left in 2005.

39
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,167
Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,

40
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:35,601
it had now turned into the most
dangerous city in Pakistan.

41
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:39,176
Hazaras are confined into two small areas,

42
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:44,029
and they are marginalized socially,
educationally, and financially.

43
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,469
This is Nadir.

44
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,466
I had known him since my childhood.

45
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:51,645
He was injured when his van
was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.

46
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:55,221
He later died of his injuries.

47
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:59,006
Around 1,600 Hazara members

48
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:02,629
had been killed in various attacks,

49
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,527
and around 3,000 of them were injured,

50
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,778
and many of them permanently disabled.

51
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:14,076
The attacks on the Hazara community
would only get worse,

52
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,908
so it was not surprising
that many wanted to flee.

53
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:21,668
After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,

54
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:28,332
Australia is home to the fourth largest
population of Hazaras in the world.

55
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,141
When it came time to leave Pakistan,

56
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,091
Australia seemed the obvious choice.

57
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,088
Financially, only one of us could leave,

58
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,946
and it was decided that I would go,

59
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:40,299
in the hope that if I arrived
at my destination safely,

60
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:45,291
I could work to get the rest
of my family to join me later.

61
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,870
We all knew about the risks,

62
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,842
and how terrifying the journey is,

63
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:54,416
and I met many people
who lost loved ones at sea.

64
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,805
It was a desperate decision to take,
to leave everything behind,

65
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,680
and no one makes this decision easily.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,866
If I had been able
to simply fly to Australia,

67
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,490
it would have taken me
less than 24 hours.

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,576
But getting a visa was impossible.

69
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,689
My journey was much longer,

70
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,943
much more complicated,

71
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:17,989
and certainly more dangerous,

72
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,631
traveling to Thailand by air,

73
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:25,429
and then by road and boat
to Malaysia and into Indonesia,

74
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,844
paying people and smugglers all the way

75
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:30,584
and spending a lot of time hiding

76
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:34,300
and a lot of time in fear of being caught.

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,687
In Indonesia, I joined a group
of seven asylum seekers.

78
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:41,241
We all shared a bedroom

79
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:45,119
in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.

80
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,419
After spending a week in Bogor,

81
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,868
three of my roommates
left for the perilous journey,

82
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:54,700
and we got the news two days later

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,506
that a distressed boat sank
in the sea en route to Christmas Island.

84
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:03,267
We found out that our three roommates --
Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir --

85
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,218
were also among those.

86
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,656
Only Jaffar was rescued.

87
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:11,249
Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.

88
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,898
It made me think,

89
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,568
am I doing the right thing?

90
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:19,515
I concluded I really had
no other choice but to go on.

91
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:23,370
A few weeks later, we got the call
from the people smuggler

92
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,060
to alert us that the boat is ready for us
to commence our sea journey.

93
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,940
Taken in the night towards the main vessel

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,588
on a motorboat,

95
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:37,603
we boarded an old fishing boat
that was already overloaded.

96
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,693
There were 93 of us,

97
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,666
and we were all below deck.

98
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,919
No one was allowed up on the top.

99
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,077
We all paid 6,000 dollars each

100
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,166
for this part of the trip.

101
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,395
The first night and day went smoothly,

102
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,623
but by the second night,
the weather turned.

103
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:59,568
Waves tossed the boat around,
and the timbers groaned.

104
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,910
People below deck were crying,
praying, recalling their loved ones.

105
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,652
They were screaming.

106
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:07,811
It was a terrible moment.

107
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:11,758
It was like a scene from doomsday,

108
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:16,583
or maybe like one of those scenes
from those Hollywood movies

109
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,788
that shows that everything
is breaking apart

110
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,225
and the world is just ending.

111
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:24,849
It was happening to us for real.

112
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,192
We didn't have any hope.

113
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:32,720
Our boat was floating
like a matchbox on the water

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,856
without any control.

115
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:38,618
The waves were much higher than our boat,

116
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:44,655
and the water poured in faster
than the motor pumps could take it out.

117
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,511
We all lost hope.

118
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,950
We thought, this is the end.

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,876
We were watching our deaths,

120
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,268
and I was documenting it.

121
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:56,219
The captain told us

122
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,586
that we are not going to make it,

123
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,767
we have to turn back the boat.

124
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,834
We went on the deck

125
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,366
and turned our torches on and off

126
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:11,265
to attract the attention
of any passing boat.

127
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:18,649
We kept trying to attract their attention
by waving our life jackets and whistling.

128
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:22,084
Eventually, we made it to a small island.

129
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:25,335
Our boat crashing onto the rocks,

130
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,378
I slipped into the water

131
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:31,025
and destroyed my camera,
whatever I had documented.

132
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:36,791
But luckily, the memory card survived.

133
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,206
It was a thick forest.

134
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:44,965
We all split up into many groups
as we argued over what to do next.

135
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,333
We were all scared and confused.

136
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,630
Then, after spending
the night on the beach,

137
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,253
we found a jetty and coconuts.

138
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,249
We hailed a boat from a nearby resort,

139
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:00,498
and then were quickly handed over
to Indonesian water police.

140
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:04,100
At Serang Detention Center,

141
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,158
an immigration officer came
and furtively strip-searched us.

142
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,526
He took our mobile, my $300 cash,

143
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,938
our shoes that we should not
be able to escape,

144
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:21,999
but we kept watching the guards,
checking their movements,

145
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,842
and around 4 a.m.
when they sat around a fire,

146
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:29,396
we removed two glass layers
from an outside facing window

147
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,915
and slipped through.

148
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:35,744
We climbed a tree next to an outer wall
that was topped with the shards of glass.

149
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:38,043
We put the pillow on that

150
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:41,573
and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets

151
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:43,671
and climbed the wall,

152
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,418
and we ran away with bare feet.

153
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:49,207
I was free,

154
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,924
with an uncertain future,

155
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,734
no money.

156
00:08:53,734 --> 00:09:00,858
The only thing I had was the memory card
with the pictures and footage.

157
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:04,275
When my documentary was aired
on SBS Dateline,

158
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,854
many of my friends came to know
about my situation,

159
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,710
and they tried to help me.

160
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,448
They did not allow me to take
any other boat to risk my life.

161
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:16,953
I also decided to stay in Indonesia
and process my case through UNHCR,

162
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,807
but I was really afraid
that I would end up in Indonesia

163
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,461
for many years doing nothing
and unable to work,

164
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:27,706
like every other asylum seeker.

165
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,930
But it had happened to be
a little bit different with me.

166
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,923
I was lucky.

167
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:40,381
My contacts worked to expedite
my case through UNHCR,

168
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:45,119
and I got resettled
in Australia in May 2013.

169
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:49,298
Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.

170
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:56,588
It is really difficult to live a life
with an uncertain fate, in limbo.

171
00:09:56,588 --> 00:10:00,419
The issue of asylum seekers in Australia

172
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,137
has been so extremely politicized

173
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:06,271
that it has lost its human face.

174
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:12,372
The asylum seekers have been demonized
and then presented to the people.

175
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:16,907
I hope my story and the story
