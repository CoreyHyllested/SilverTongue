00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,092
I'm going to start with a little story.

2
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:17,204
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

3
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:21,755
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,716
over four months, slowly wasting away until

5
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,604
I was basically a famine victim

6
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:29,628
with an unquenchable thirst.

7
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,237
I had basically digested away my body.

8
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:37,531
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

9
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,576
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

10
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:43,560
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,816
of water and drinking like a dog.

12
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:50,328
That night, I was taken into the emergency room

13
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:54,209
and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.

14
00:00:54,209 --> 00:01:00,144
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,

15
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:05,600
insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,111
And something festered inside me after this happened.

17
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,624
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?

18
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,477
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease

19
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,852
where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought

20
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:22,893
that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen

21
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:27,365
had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen

22
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,423
and then kill the cells that make insulin.

23
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,733
And this is what I thought for a long period of time,

24
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:35,781
and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,

25
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,703
the microbes that do bad things.

26
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:41,771
And that's where I need my assistant here now.

27
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,209
You may recognize her.

28
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:49,889
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,

29
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,130
and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,577
and they sell toys, giant microbes.

31
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,962
And here we go!

32
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:05,717
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.

33
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:10,145
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.

34
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:13,852
(Laughter)

35
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:20,233
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes

36
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,576
they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.

37
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,545
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,

38
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,192
and that's what I was focusing on.

39
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:32,753
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,

40
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:37,273
and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,

41
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,393
rather than killing us.

42
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:41,584
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.

43
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:45,161
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,

44
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,953
I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...

45
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:49,051
(Laughter)

46
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,993
The microbes that cover us.

47
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:54,153
And if you look at them in the microscope,

48
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:57,557
you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells

49
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:01,025
of microbes on us as we have human cells.

50
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:05,776
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.

51
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:10,097
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.

52
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:14,697
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,

53
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:16,977
just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.

54
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,557
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.

55
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:22,085
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes

56
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,621
and to understand them is to look at their DNA.

57
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,763
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,

58
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:30,645
using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,

59
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,549
including the human body, reading the DNA sequence

60
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,169
and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about

61
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,335
the microbes that are in a particular place.

62
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:41,198
And what's amazing, when you use this technology,

63
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:44,358
for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered

64
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,494
in a sea of microbes.

65
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:50,605
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.

66
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:55,958
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human

67
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,605
microbiome covering us.

68
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:01,110
And so this microbial diversity differs between people,

69
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,246
and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,

70
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:07,366
maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,

71
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,414
this microbial cloud in and on us,

72
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:13,294
and the variation between us, may be responsible

73
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,864
for some of the health and illness differences between us.

74
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:19,987
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.

75
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:23,393
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers

76
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,774
for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,

77
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:30,165
but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes

78
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,662
that live in and on you.

79
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,366
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's

80
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:38,399
in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort

81
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,638
of immune response and led to me killing the cells

82
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,859
that make insulin in my body.

83
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,955
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,

84
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,747
what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques

85
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,406
in particular, to study the microbial cloud

86
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,980
that lives in and on us.

87
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,444
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.

88
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,238
My first personal experience with studying the microbes

89
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:04,388
on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,

90
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,188
right around the corner from here at Georgetown.

91
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:09,205
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be

92
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,748
the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,

93
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:14,238
and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing

94
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:17,588
a study of ileal transplants in people.

95
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:21,564
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.

96
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:24,628
And so I started a collaboration with this person,

97
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,901
Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes

98
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:32,374
that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.

99
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,516
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study

100
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,766
that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story

101
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,990
is something really striking that they did at the beginning

102
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,013
of this project.

103
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:46,378
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor

104
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,661
and they have a recipient who might have a problem

105
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:51,286
with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,

106
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:54,846
and they sterilized the donor ileum.

107
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:59,141
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.

108
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,805
They did this because this was common practice

109
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:04,934
in medicine, even though it was obvious

110
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:07,072
that this was not a good idea.

111
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:10,077
And fortunately, in the course of this project,

112
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,640
the transplant surgeons and the other people

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,061
decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.

114
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,206
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial

115
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:25,206
community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,

116
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:28,782
and theoretically that might help the people who are

117
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,871
receiving this ileal transplant.

118
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:34,173
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.

119
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:36,478
In the last few years there's been a great expansion

120
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,656
in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.

121
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,464
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project

122
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:44,320
that's going on in the United States,

123
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,854
and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.

124
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:50,043
And when people have done a variety of studies,

125
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,675
they have learned things such as, when a baby is

126
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,659
born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the

127
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,851
microbes from your mother.

128
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,907
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,

129
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:04,938
some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization

130
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,330
when you carve a baby out of its mother

131
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,155
rather than being delivered through the birth canal.

132
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:13,604
And a variety of other studies have shown that the

133
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,411
microbial community that lives in and on us

134
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,674
helps in development of the immune system,

135
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:22,619
helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,

136
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,699
and determining our metabolic rate, probably

137
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,874
determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior

138
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,810
in a variety of ways.

139
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,866
And so, these studies have documented or suggested

140
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:38,153
out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,

141
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:42,690
this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.

142
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,274
And one area that I think is very interesting,

143
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:48,940
which many of you may have now that we've thrown

144
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,870
microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."

145
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,829
So people are really into cleanliness, right?

146
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:57,808
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,

147
00:07:57,808 --> 00:08:00,904
people are washing every part of them all of the time,

148
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:05,930
we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,

149
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,371
we take antibiotics excessively.

150
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:12,210
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,

151
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,474
but we should understand that when we pump chemicals

152
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,371
and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing

153
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,666
the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.

154
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,666
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,

155
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,895
has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors

156
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:31,151
for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety

157
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,055
of problems that are probably due to disruption

158
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,159
of the microbial community.

159
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,511
So the microbial community can go wrong

160
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,223
whether we want it to or not,

161
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,471
or we can kill it with antibiotics,

162
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,567
but what can we do to restore it?

163
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,679
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.

164
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,687
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore

165
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:54,111
the microbial community that is in and on you.

166
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:57,583
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.

167
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,680
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using

168
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,575
probiotics to try and treat, prevent,

169
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,087
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.

170
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,495
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.

171
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,015
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent

172
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:15,151
the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis

173
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,816
in these premature infants.

174
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:20,807
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.

175
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,162
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat

176
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:28,949
have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,

177
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:32,615
and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.

178
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,543
So what can we do to restore our microbial community

179
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,742
when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?

180
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:42,448
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,

181
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,462
they eat poo -- coprophagia.

182
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:51,071
And it turns out that many veterinarians,

183
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:53,080
old school veterinarians in particular,

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,796
have been doing something called "poo tea,"

185
00:09:55,796 --> 00:10:01,601
not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other

186
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,224
ailments in horses and cows and things like that,

187
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:09,172
where you make tea from the poo from a healthy

188
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,321
individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.

189
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,761
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,

190
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,300
and you can put your hand into its rumen,

191
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,708
it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes

192
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,637
directly into the mouth and through the entire

193
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:29,285
top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,

194
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:33,405
so you may have heard in people they are now doing

195
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:38,055
fecal transplants, where rather than delivering

196
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,487
a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,

197
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,940
they are delivering a community of probiotics,

198
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,420
a community of microbes from a healthy donor,

199
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,557
through the other end.

200
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,887
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting

201
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,253
certain intransigent infectious diseases

202
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,092
like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay

203
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,189
with people for years and years and years.

204
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:05,052
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,

205
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,917
from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure

206
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,778
systemic C. dif infections in some people.

207
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:16,620
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or

208
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,079
the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people

209
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,823
have come up with this same idea, is that

210
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:26,711
the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.

211
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:31,718
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.

212
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:35,709
We should treat it carefully and with respect,

213
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,689
and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections

214
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:44,597
or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,

215
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:47,814
without some real good justification.

216
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:51,454
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now

217
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:58,406
is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease

218
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:00,941
and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.

219
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,774
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,

220
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,198
and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.

221
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:11,278
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes

222
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,581
and their genes and see if there are differences.

223
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,983
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not

224
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,607
just correlative differences, but causative.

225
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,077
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals

226
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,286
are also helping do this, but people are now using

227
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:29,590
these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,

228
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,504
to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.

229
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:38,094
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,

230
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:41,301
I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.

231
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,065
It turns out that my father was an M.D.,

232
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:48,537
actually studied hormones. I told him many times

233
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:53,327
that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.

234
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:56,206
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought

235
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:59,485
I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical

236
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:02,104
M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."

237
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:05,325
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology

238
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,455
meeting as family in Quebec.

239
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,949
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,

240
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,384
and drinking everybody's water at the table,

241
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,318
and I think they all thought I was a druggie.

242
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,038
(Laughter)

243
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,014
But the reason I'm telling you this is that

244
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:25,014
the medical community, my father as an example,

245
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,581
sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.

246
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:32,566
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

247
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:35,366
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.

248
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,837
They're microbes. They're tiny.

249
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:39,789
But we can see them through their DNA,

250
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,038
we can see them through the effects that they have on people.

251
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,656
And what we need now

252
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:48,325
is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context

253
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:50,838
of everything in human medicine.

254
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:53,905
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,

255
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,304
but it might.

256
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:59,229
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes

257
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,622
that live in and on people, so that we can understand

258
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,894
what they're doing to our lives.

259
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:08,965
We are them. They are us.

260
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,293
Thank you.

261
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,278
(Applause)
