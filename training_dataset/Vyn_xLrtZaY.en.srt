00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:16,014
An evolutionary biologist
at Purdue University

1
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:19,160
named William Muir studied chickens.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,249
He was interested in productivity --

3
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:23,539
I think it's something
that concerns all of us --

4
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,827
but it's easy to measure in chickens
because you just count the eggs.

5
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,527
(Laughter)

6
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,944
He wanted to know what could make
his chickens more productive,

7
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,870
so he devised a beautiful experiment.

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,328
Chickens live in groups, so first of all,
he selected just an average flock,

9
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:42,718
and he let it alone for six generations.

10
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,807
But then he created a second group

11
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,315
of the individually
most productive chickens --

12
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,270
you could call them superchickens --

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,377
and he put them together in a superflock,

14
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:57,075
and each generation, he selected
only the most productive for breeding.

15
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:59,969
After six generations had passed,

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,717
what did he find?

17
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:05,548
Well, the first group, the average group,
was doing just fine.

18
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:08,074
They were all plump and fully feathered

19
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,352
and egg production
had increased dramatically.

20
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,559
What about the second group?

21
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,293
Well, all but three were dead.

22
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:18,413
They'd pecked the rest to death.

23
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,990
(Laughter)

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,501
The individually productive chickens
had only achieved their success

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,164
by suppressing the productivity
of the rest.

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,525
Now, as I've gone around the world
talking about this and telling this story

27
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:36,777
in all sorts of organizations
and companies,

28
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:39,353
people have seen
the relevance almost instantly,

29
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,659
and they come up and they say
things to me like,

30
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,750
"That superflock, that's my company."

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,715
(Laughter)

32
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:50,226
Or, "That's my country."

33
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:52,318
Or, "That's my life."

34
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:56,722
All my life I've been told that the way
we have to get ahead is to compete:

35
00:01:56,722 --> 00:02:00,754
get into the right school,
get into the right job, get to the top,

36
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,492
and I've really never found it
very inspiring.

37
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:09,275
I've started and run businesses
because invention is a joy,

38
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,595
and because working alongside
brilliant, creative people

39
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:14,075
is its own reward.

40
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:20,397
And I've never really felt very motivated
by pecking orders or by superchickens

41
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:22,966
or by superstars.

42
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,220
But for the past 50 years,

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,452
we've run most organizations
and some societies

44
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,770
along the superchicken model.

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,582
We've thought that success is achieved
by picking the superstars,

46
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:39,731
the brightest men,
or occasionally women, in the room,

47
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:43,090
and giving them all the resources
and all the power.

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,493
And the result has been just the same
as in William Muir's experiment:

49
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:52,462
aggression, dysfunction and waste.

50
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:56,572
If the only way the most productive
can be successful

51
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:59,753
is by suppressing
the productivity of the rest,

52
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:03,236
then we badly need to find
a better way to work

53
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:06,010
and a richer way to live.

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,921
(Applause)

55
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,915
So what is it that makes some groups

56
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:18,390
obviously more successful
and more productive than others?

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,974
Well, that's the question
a team at MIT took to research.

58
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,400
They brought in hundreds of volunteers,

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,894
they put them into groups, and they
gave them very hard problems to solve.

60
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:30,625
And what happened was exactly
what you'd expect,

61
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,931
that some groups were very much
more successful than others,

62
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:37,461
but what was really interesting
was that the high-achieving groups

63
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:40,108
were not those where they had
one or two people

64
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:43,149
with spectacularly high I.Q.

65
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:46,748
Nor were the most successful groups
the ones that had the highest

66
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:49,117
aggregate I.Q.

67
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:54,991
Instead, they had three characteristics,
the really successful teams.

68
00:03:54,991 --> 00:04:00,633
First of all, they showed high degrees
of social sensitivity to each other.

69
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:04,232
This is measured by something called
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.

70
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,717
It's broadly considered
a test for empathy,

71
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,914
and the groups that scored highly on this

72
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,864
did better.

73
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:15,972
Secondly, the successful groups
gave roughly equal time to each other,

74
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:18,317
so that no one voice dominated,

75
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:21,103
but neither were there any passengers.

76
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,820
And thirdly, the more successful groups

77
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,165
had more women in them.

78
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,162
(Applause)

79
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:32,437
Now, was this because women
typically score more highly on

80
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:34,310
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,

81
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,037
so you're getting a doubling down
on the empathy quotient?

82
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,795
Or was it because they brought
a more diverse perspective?

83
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,951
We don't really know, but the striking
thing about this experiment

84
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,380
is that it showed what we know, which is
some groups do better than others,

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,731
but what's key to that

86
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:54,378
is their social connectedness
to each other.

87
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,375
So how does this play out
in the real world?

88
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:03,716
Well, it means that what happens
between people really counts,

89
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:07,524
because in groups that are highly
attuned and sensitive to each other,

90
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,780
ideas can flow and grow.

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,768
People don't get stuck.
They don't waste energy down dead ends.

92
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:19,482
An example: Arup is one of the world's
most successful engineering firms,

93
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:22,134
and it was commissioned to build
the equestrian center

94
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,000
for the Beijing Olympics.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,826
Now, this building had to receive

96
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:31,120
two and a half thousand
really highly strung thoroughbred horses

97
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,209
that were coming off long-haul flights,

98
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,692
highly jet-lagged,
not feeling their finest.

99
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:40,104
And the problem
the engineer confronted was,

100
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:43,780
what quantity of waste to cater for?

101
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,184
Now, you don't get taught this
in engineering school -- (Laughter) --

102
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,388
and it's not really the kind of thing
you want to get wrong,

103
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:55,853
so he could have spent months
talking to vets, doing the research,

104
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:57,654
tweaking the spreadsheet.

105
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,799
Instead, he asked for help

106
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:05,285
and he found someone who had designed
the Jockey Club in New York.

107
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:09,404
The problem was solved in less than a day.

108
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:12,191
Arup believes that
the culture of helpfulness

109
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:14,959
is central to their success.

110
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,400
Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,498
but it's absolutely core
to successful teams,

112
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:28,707
and it routinely outperforms
individual intelligence.

113
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:32,322
Helpfulness means I don't
have to know everything,

114
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:37,600
I just have to work among people
who are good at getting and giving help.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,361
At SAP, they reckon that you can answer
any question in 17 minutes.

116
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:47,126
But there isn't a single
high-tech company I've worked with

117
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:52,571
that imagines for a moment
that this is a technology issue,

118
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:57,041
because what drives helpfulness
is people getting to know each other.

119
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:02,782
Now that sounds so obvious, and we think
it'll just happen normally,

120
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:04,410
but it doesn't.

121
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,704
When I was running
my first software company,

122
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,738
I realized that we were getting stuck.

123
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:13,523
There was a lot of friction,
but not much else,

124
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:18,399
and I gradually realized the brilliant,
creative people that I'd hired

125
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,364
didn't know each other.

126
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:24,241
They were so focused
on their own individual work,

127
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:27,970
they didn't even know
who they were sitting next to,

128
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,541
and it was only when I insisted
that we stop working

129
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,125
and invest time in getting
to know each other

130
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,223
that we achieved real momentum.

131
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,409
Now, that was 20 years ago,
and now I visit companies

132
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,311
that have banned coffee cups at desks

133
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,305
because they want people to hang out
around the coffee machines

134
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,139
and talk to each other.

135
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,647
The Swedes even have
a special term for this.

136
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:54,007
They call it fika, which means
more than a coffee break.

137
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,613
It means collective restoration.

138
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,724
At Idexx, a company up in Maine,

139
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,516
they've created vegetable gardens
on campus so that people

140
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,768
from different parts of the business

141
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:10,644
can work together and get to know
the whole business that way.

142
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,989
Have they all gone mad?

143
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:16,542
Quite the opposite -- they've figured out
that when the going gets tough,

144
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,585
and it always will get tough

145
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:21,301
if you're doing breakthrough work
that really matters,

146
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,972
what people need is social support,

147
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:27,199
and they need to know who to ask for help.

148
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,936
Companies don't have ideas;
only people do.

149
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,536
And what motivates people

150
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:39,030
are the bonds and loyalty and trust
they develop between each other.

151
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:43,260
What matters is the mortar,

152
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,549
not just the bricks.

153
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,273
Now, when you put all of this together,

154
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,431
what you get is something
called social capital.

155
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:56,980
Social capital is the reliance
and interdependency that builds trust.

156
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,471
The term comes from sociologists
who were studying communities

157
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,739
that proved particularly resilient
in times of stress.

158
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,960
Social capital is what
gives companies momentum,

159
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,222
and social capital
is what makes companies robust.

160
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,442
What does this mean in practical terms?

161
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,759
It means that time is everything,

162
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,426
because social capital
compounds with time.

163
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:32,534
So teams that work together longer
get better, because it takes time

164
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:38,041
to develop the trust you need
for real candor and openness.

165
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,925
And time is what builds value.

166
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,878
When Alex Pentland
suggested to one company

167
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,594
that they synchronize coffee breaks

168
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:51,495
so that people would have time
to talk to each other,

169
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:54,978
profits went up 15 million dollars,

170
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:58,832
and employee satisfaction
went up 10 percent.

171
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,933
Not a bad return on social capital,

172
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:05,960
which compounds even as you spend it.

173
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,022
Now, this isn't about chumminess,
and it's no charter for slackers,

174
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:16,656
because people who work this way
tend to be kind of scratchy,

175
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:20,690
impatient, absolutely determined
to think for themselves

176
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,680
because that's what their contribution is.

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,979
Conflict is frequent
because candor is safe.

178
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,471
And that's how good ideas
turn into great ideas,

179
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,571
because no idea is born fully formed.

180
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,900
It emerges a little bit
as a child is born,

181
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,489
kind of messy and confused,
but full of possibilities.

182
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:52,610
And it's only through the generous
contribution, faith and challenge

183
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,892
that they achieve their potential.

184
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:59,955
And that's what social capital supports.

185
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,228
Now, we aren't really used
to talking about this,

186
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:08,198
about talent, about creativity,
in this way.

187
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,932
We're used to talking about stars.

188
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:16,371
So I started to wonder,
well, if we start working this way,

189
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,595
does that mean no more stars?

190
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,805
So I went and I sat in on the auditions

191
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:25,661
at the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art in London.

192
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,886
And what I saw there really surprised me,

193
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:33,786
because the teachers weren't looking
for individual pyrotechnics.

194
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:38,476
They were looking for what happened
between the students,

195
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:42,586
because that's where the drama is.

196
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,875
And when I talked
to producers of hit albums,

197
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,103
they said, "Oh sure, we have
lots of superstars in music.

198
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:51,220
It's just, they don't last very long.

199
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,220
It's the outstanding collaborators
who enjoy the long careers,

200
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,432
because bringing out the best in others
is how they found the best

201
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:01,076
in themselves."

202
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:04,115
And when I went to visit companies
that are renowned

203
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:06,182
for their ingenuity and creativity,

204
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:09,107
I couldn't even see any superstars,

205
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:13,445
because everybody there really mattered.

206
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,328
And when I reflected on my own career,

207
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:20,252
and the extraordinary people
I've had the privilege to work with,

208
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:25,796
I realized how much more
we could give each other

209
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:30,917
if we just stopped trying
to be superchickens.

210
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:36,970
(Laughter) (Applause)

211
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:43,346
Once you appreciate
truly how social work is,

212
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,443
a lot of things have to change.

213
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:50,530
Management by talent contest
has routinely pitted

214
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,991
employees against each other.

215
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:57,505
Now, rivalry has to be replaced
by social capital.

216
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:01,480
For decades, we've tried
to motivate people with money,

217
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
even though we've got
a vast amount of research that shows

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,191
that money erodes social connectedness.

219
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:14,186
Now, we need to let people
motivate each other.

220
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:19,570
And for years, we've thought that leaders
were heroic soloists who were expected,

221
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,726
all by themselves,
to solve complex problems.

222
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:26,278
Now, we need to redefine leadership

223
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,342
as an activity in which
conditions are created

224
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:36,300
in which everyone can do their most
courageous thinking together.

225
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,820
We know that this works.

226
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,505
When the Montreal Protocol called
for the phasing out of CFCs,

227
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:48,847
the chlorofluorocarbons implicated
in the hole in the ozone layer,

228
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,032
the risks were immense.

229
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,231
CFCs were everywhere,

230
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,780
and nobody knew if a substitute
could be found.

231
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,671
But one team that rose to the challenge
adopted three key principles.

232
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,647
The first was the head of engineering,
Frank Maslen, said,

233
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,980
there will be no stars in this team.

234
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,257
We need everybody.

235
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,985
Everybody has a valid perspective.

236
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:19,711
Second, we work to one standard only:

237
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:22,310
the best imaginable.

238
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,632
And third, he told his boss,
Geoff Tudhope,

239
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,605
that he had to butt out,

240
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,856
because he knew
how disruptive power can be.

241
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:33,689
Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.

242
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,430
He gave the team air cover,

243
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,540
and he listened to ensure
that they honored their principles.

244
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,260
And it worked: Ahead of all the other
companies tackling this hard problem,

245
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,518
this group cracked it first.

246
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:52,339
And to date, the Montreal Protocol

247
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:58,060
is the most successful international
environmental agreement

248
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,982
ever implemented.

249
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,940
There was a lot at stake then,

250
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,679
and there's a lot at stake now,

251
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,207
and we won't solve our problems
if we expect it to be solved

252
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,808
by a few supermen or superwomen.

253
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:17,314
Now we need everybody,

254
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:23,540
because it is only when we accept
that everybody has value

255
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:30,586
that we will liberate the energy
and imagination and momentum we need

256
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:35,360
to create the best beyond measure.

257
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,100
Thank you.

258
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,100
(Applause)
