0
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:24,503
(Music)

1
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:50,077
(Applause)

2
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,433
Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars"
first hit the airwaves,

3
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:01,536
that is not what it looked like.

4
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,097
(Laughter)

5
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,148
Jeff and I were full-time
ballroom dance instructors

6
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:09,585
when the big TV ballroom revival hit,

7
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:12,800
and this was incredible.

8
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,736
I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,797
and people were like "Foxes trotting."

10
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,551
(Laughter)

11
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,529
And the next day they were telling us

12
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:24,941
the finer points of a good feather step.

13
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,318
And this blew our minds.

14
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:32,564
I mean, all of the ballroom dance
geeking out that we had always done

15
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:36,227
on why salsa worked differently
than the competitive rumba

16
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:38,755
and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,

17
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:42,796
all of that just hit
the public consciousness,

18
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:44,899
and it changed everything.

19
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,200
But running parallel to this excitement,

20
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:52,575
the excitement that suddenly,
somehow, we were cool --

21
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,020
(Laughter)

22
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,057
there was also this reservation.

23
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,371
Why this and why now?

24
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,789
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I
would get together for training seminars

25
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:05,972
or just for fun,

26
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:07,862
we'd toss each other around, mix it up,

27
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:10,073
take a break from having
to lead all the time.

28
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,867
We even came up with a system
for switching lead and follow

29
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,042
while we were dancing,

30
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,075
as a way of taking turns and playing fair.

31
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,056
It wasn't until we used that system
as part of a performance

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,241
in a small festival

33
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:22,392
that we got an important tap
on the shoulder.

34
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,724
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge
and director of a playwright center,

35
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,746
pulled us aside after the show and said,

36
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,834
"Do you have any idea
how political that was?"

37
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,874
(Laughter)

38
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:35,667
So that began an eight-year
collaboration to create a play

39
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,452
which not only further developed
our system for switching

40
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:42,234
but also explored the impact
of being locked into a single role,

41
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,422
and what's worse,

42
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,575
being defined by that single role.

43
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,492
TC: Because, of course,

44
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:52,177
classic Latin and ballroom dancing
isn't just a system of dancing;

45
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,344
it's a way of thinking, of being,

46
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:57,547
of relating to each other

47
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,162
that captured a whole period's values.

48
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,966
There's one thing that stayed
consistent, though:

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,316
the man leads

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,735
and the woman follows.

51
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:08,854
So street salsa, championship tango,
it's all the same --

52
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,736
he leads, she follows.

53
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,074
So this was gender training.

54
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:15,425
You weren't just learning to dance --

55
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,489
you were learning to "man" and to "woman."

56
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:21,003
It's a relic.

57
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,896
And in the way of relics,
you don't throw it out,

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,303
but you need to know
that this is the past.

59
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,707
This isn't the present.

60
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,945
It's like Shakespeare:
respect it, revive it -- great!

61
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,455
But know that this is history.

62
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,021
This doesn't represent how we think today.

63
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,585
So we asked ourselves:

64
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,263
If you strip it all down,

65
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:43,431
what is at the core of partner dancing?

66
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:46,329
JF: Well, the core principle
of partner dancing

67
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,753
is that one person leads,
the other one follows.

68
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:52,364
The machine works the same,
regardless of who's playing which role.

69
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:55,659
The physics of movement doesn't really
give a crap about your gender.

70
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:56,723
(Laughter)

71
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,777
So if we were to update the existing form,

72
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,895
we would need to make it
more representative

73
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,189
of how we interact here, now, in 2015.

74
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,963
When you watch ballroom,
don't just watch what's there.

75
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:08,699
Watch what's not.

76
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,101
The couple is always
only a man and a woman.

77
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,283
Together.

78
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:14,579
Only.

79
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,754
Ever.

80
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:19,860
So, same-sex and gender nonconformist
couples just disappear.

81
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:22,516
In most mainstream international
ballroom competitions,

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,159
same-sex couples are rarely
recognized on the floor,

83
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,367
and in many cases,

84
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,128
the rules prohibit them completely.

85
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:32,987
TC: Try this: Google-image,
"professional Latin dancer,"

86
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,715
and then look for an actual Latino person.

87
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,106
(Laughter)

88
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,669
You'll be there for days.

89
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:43,170
What you will get is page after page
of white, straight Russian couples

90
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,159
spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.

91
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,084
(Laughter)

92
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,368
There are no black people,
there are no Asians,

93
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,676
no mixed-race couples,

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,228
so basically, non-white people
just disappeared.

95
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:58,739
Even within the white-straight-
couple-only paradigm --

96
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:01,389
she can't be taller,

97
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,881
he can't be shorter.

98
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,528
She can't be bolder,

99
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,420
he can't be gentler.

100
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,481
If you were to take a ballroom dance

101
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,798
and translate that into a conversation

102
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,264
and drop that into a movie,

103
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:16,910
we, as a culture,
would never stand for this.

104
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,857
He dictates, she reacts.

105
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:23,679
No relationship -- gay,
straight or anything --

106
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:28,110
that we would regard as remotely healthy
or functional looks like that,

107
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,720
and yet somehow,

108
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:32,358
you put it on prime time,
you slap some makeup on it,

109
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:36,039
throw the glitter on, put it out there
as movement, not as text,

110
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:38,950
and we, as a culture,

111
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,297
tune in and clap.

112
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,751
We are applauding our own absence.

113
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,948
Too many people have disappeared
from partner dancing.

114
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:54,592
(Music)

115
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:38,915
(Applause)

116
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:43,496
JF: Now, you just saw
two men dancing together.

117
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,533
(Laughter)

118
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,022
And you thought it looked ...

119
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,694
a little strange.

120
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,175
Interesting -- appealing, even --

121
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,752
but a little bit odd.

122
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,356
Even avid followers of the same-sex
ballroom circuit can attest

123
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,490
that while same-sex partner dancing
can be dynamic and strong and exciting,

124
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,837
it just doesn't quite seem to fit.

125
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:03,663
Aesthetically speaking,

126
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:07,733
if Alida and I take the classic
closed ballroom hold ...

127
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,194
this is considered beautiful.

128
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,392
(Laughter)

129
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:17,961
But why not this?

130
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,675
(Laughter)

131
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,367
See, the standard image that the leader
must be larger and masculine

132
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,485
and the follower smaller and feminine --

133
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,429
this is a stumbling point.

134
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,848
TC: So we wanted to look at this
from a totally different angle.

135
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:37,035
So, what if we could keep
the idea of lead and follow

136
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,255
but toss the idea that this
was connected to gender?

137
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:45,827
Further, what if a couple
could lead and follow each other

138
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,080
and then switch?

139
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:48,746
And then switch back?

140
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,139
What if it could be like a conversation,

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,018
taking turns listening and speaking,
just like we do in life?

142
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:59,254
What if we could dance like that?

143
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:03,059
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."

144
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,461
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,

145
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,199
salsa.

146
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:12,161
In salsa, there's a key transitional step,
called the cross-body lead.

147
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,945
We use it as punctuation
to break up the improvisation.

148
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:18,339
It can be a little tricky to spot
if you're not used to looking for it,

149
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:19,514
so here it is.

150
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,845
One more time for the cheap seats.

151
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,305
(Laughter)

152
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:34,383
And here's the action one more time,

153
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,766
nice and slow.

154
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:44,929
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking
to this transitional step,

155
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:46,635
the cross-body lead becomes a point

156
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,644
where the lead and the follow can switch.

157
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,191
The person following can elect
to take over the lead,

158
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,568
or the person leading can choose
to surrender it,

159
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,184
essentially making it
a counter-cross-body lead.

160
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,144
Here's how that looks in slow motion.

161
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:09,300
And here's how it looked
when we danced it in the opening dance.

162
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:18,162
With this simple tweak,
the dance moves from being a dictation

163
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,375
to a negotiation.

164
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,254
Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.

165
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,761
And more importantly,
you can change your mind.

166
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,889
Now, this is only one example
of how this applies,

167
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:30,552
but once the blinkers come off,
anything can happen.

168
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,273
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking
could apply to a classic waltz.

169
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:37,525
Because, of course,

170
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,140
it isn't just a system of switching leads;

171
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,330
it's a way of thinking

172
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,610
that can actually make
the dance itself more efficient.

173
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:46,329
So: the waltz.

174
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,563
The waltz is a turning dance.

175
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:50,596
This means that for the lead,

176
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,832
you spend half of the dance
traveling backwards,

177
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,326
completely blind.

178
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,899
And because of the follower's position,

179
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,731
basically, no one can see
where they're going.

180
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,103
(Laughter)

181
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,139
So you're out here on the floor,

182
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,827
and then imagine that coming right at you.

183
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,200
JF: Raaaaaah!

184
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:09,748
(Laughter)

185
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:13,068
TC: There are actually a lot
of accidents out there

186
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:15,334
that happen as a result
of this blind spot.

187
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,322
But what if the partners
were to just allow for

188
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,495
a switch of posture for a moment?

189
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,798
A lot of accidents could be avoided.

190
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:29,093
Even if one person led the whole dance
but allowed this switch to happen,

191
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:30,503
it would be a lot safer,

192
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,571
while at the same time,
offering new aesthetics into the waltz.

193
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:37,654
Because physics doesn't give a damn
about your gender.

194
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:38,737
(Laughter)

195
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:43,155
JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead
in clubs, convention centers

196
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,007
and as part of "First Dance,"
the play we created with Lisa,

197
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,363
on stages in North America and in Europe.

198
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:50,070
And it never fails to engage.

199
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:54,217
I mean, beyond the unusual sight
of seeing two men dancing together,

200
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,735
it always evokes and engages.

201
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,461
But why?

202
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,580
The secret lies in what made
Lisa see our initial demonstration

203
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,907
as "political."

204
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,506
It wasn't just that we were
switching lead and follow;

205
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,587
it's that we stayed consistent
in our presence, our personality

206
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,540
and our power, regardless
of which role we were playing.

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,184
We were still us.

208
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,851
And that's where the true freedom lies --

209
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,864
not just the freedom to switch roles,

210
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:21,503
but the freedom from being defined
by whichever role you're playing,

211
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:24,083
the freedom to always remain
true to yourself.

212
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:27,557
Forget what a lead is supposed
to look like, or a follow.

213
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,136
Be a masculine follow

214
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,383
or a feminine lead.

215
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:32,065
Just be yourself.

216
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:35,590
Obviously, this applies
off the dance floor as well,

217
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:38,153
but on the floor, it gives us
the perfect opportunity

218
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:41,474
to update an old paradigm,
reinvigorate an old relic,

219
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:45,687
and make it more representative
of our era and our current way of being.

220
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,971
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing
all the time with women and men

221
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,383
and we love it.

222
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:55,970
But we dance with a consciousness
that this is a historic form

223
00:12:55,994 --> 00:13:00,304
that can produce silence
and produce invisibility

224
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:03,022
across the spectrum of identity
that we enjoy today.

225
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,314
We invented Liquid Lead

226
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:10,503
as a way of stripping out
all the ideas that don't belong to us

227
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,822
and taking partner dancing back
to what it really always was:

228
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,756
the fine art of taking care of each other.

229
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:27,413
(Music)

230
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:32,903
(Applause)
