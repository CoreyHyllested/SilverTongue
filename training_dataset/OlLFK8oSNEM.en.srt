00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:15,793
Some people are obsessed
by French wines.

1
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,524
Others love playing golf

2
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:20,187
or devouring literature.

3
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,304
One of my greatest pleasures
in life is, I have to admit,

4
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,534
a bit special.

5
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:30,914
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy
watching cities from the sky,

6
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,319
from an airplane window.

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,911
Some cities are calmly industrious,

8
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,475
like Dusseldorf

9
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,140
or Louisville.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,413
Others project an energy
that they can hardly contain,

11
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,754
like New York

12
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,003
or Hong Kong.

13
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:48,806
And then you have Paris

14
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,204
or Istanbul,

15
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:53,201
and their patina full of history.

16
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:56,158
I see cities as living beings.

17
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,982
And when I discover them from far above,

18
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:03,431
I like to find those main streets
and highways that structure their space.

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,495
Especially at night,

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,342
when commuters make these arteries
look dramatically red and golden:

21
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:15,195
the city's vascular system
performing its vital function

22
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,429
right before your eyes.

23
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,409
But when I'm sitting in my car

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,312
after an hour and a half
of commute every day,

25
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,213
that reality looks very different.

26
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:27,291
(Laughter)

27
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:28,473
Nothing --

28
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,187
not public radio,

29
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,370
no podcast --

30
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:32,422
(Laughter)

31
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:34,455
Not even mindfulness meditation

32
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,094
makes this time worth living.

33
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,727
(Laughter)

34
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:39,226
Isn't it absurd

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,707
that we created cars
that can reach 130 miles per hour

36
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:49,353
and we now drive them at the same speed
as 19th-century horse carriages?

37
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,636
(Laughter)

38
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,402
In the US alone,

39
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:57,820
we spent 29,6 billion hours
commuting in 2014.

40
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,899
With that amount of time,

41
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:04,214
ancient Egyptians could have built
26 Pyramids of Giza.

42
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:05,284
(Laughter)

43
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,706
We do that in one year.

44
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,106
A monumental waste of time,
energy and human potential.

45
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:13,331
For decades,

46
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,663
our remedy for congestion was simple:

47
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,728
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.

48
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,348
And it worked.

49
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,830
It worked admirably for Paris,

50
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,944
when the city tore down
hundreds of historical buildings

51
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,615
to create 85 miles

52
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,920
of transportation-friendly boulevards.

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,099
And it still works today
in fast-growing emerging cities.

54
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,945
But in more established urban centers,

55
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,899
significant network expansions
are almost impossible:

56
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:42,843
habitat is just too dense,

57
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,840
real estate, too expensive

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,924
and public finances, too fragile.

59
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,385
Our city's vascular system
is getting clogged, it's getting sick,

60
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,016
and we should pay attention.

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,743
Our current way
of thinking is not working.

62
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,093
For our transportation to flow,

63
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:00,468
we need a new source of inspiration.

64
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:04,879
So after 16 years
working in transportation,

65
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:08,983
my "aha moment" happened
when speaking with a biotech customer.

66
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,650
She was telling me how her treatment

67
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,917
was leveraging specific properties
of our vascular system.

68
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:18,050
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --

69
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:21,150
all the veins and arteries in our body

70
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,381
making miracles of logistics every day."

71
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:27,270
This is the moment I realized

72
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,277
that biology has been
in the transportation business

73
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,812
for billions of years.

74
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,728
It has been testing countless solutions

75
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:38,051
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.

76
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:42,893
It really is the world's most
sophisticated transportation laboratory.

77
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:48,829
So, what if the solution to our traffic
challenges was inside us?

78
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,160
I wanted to know:

79
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,980
Why is it that blood flows
in our veins most of our lives,

80
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:58,596
when our big cities get clogged
on a daily basis?

81
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,554
And the reality is that you're looking
at two very different networks.

82
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,832
I don't know if you realize,

83
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:10,920
but each of us has 60,000 miles
of blood vessels in our bodies --

84
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,238
60,000 miles.

85
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:14,854
That's two-and-a-half times
the Earth's circumference,

86
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:16,131
inside you.

87
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,179
What it means is that blood vessels
are everywhere inside us,

88
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:22,230
not just under the surface of our skin.

89
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,819
But if you look at our cities,

90
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,941
yes, we have some
underground subway systems

91
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:30,381
and some tunnels and bridges,

92
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:32,685
and also some helicopters in the sky.

93
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,768
But the vast majority of our traffic
is focused on the ground,

94
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,969
on the surface.

95
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,805
So in other words,

96
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,208
while our vascular system uses
the three dimensions inside us,

97
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:46,996
our urban transportation
is mostly two-dimensional.

98
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,914
And so what we need
is to embrace that verticality.

99
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,855
If our surface grid is saturated,

100
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,777
well, let's elevate our traffic.

101
00:04:56,174 --> 00:05:00,058
This Chinese concept of a bus
that can straddle traffic jams --

102
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:05,079
that was an eye-opener on new ways
to think about space and movement

103
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,389
inside our cities.

104
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:08,675
And we can go higher,

105
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,991
and suspend our transportation
like we did with our electrical grid.

106
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:16,985
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi
are talking about testing

107
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,841
these futuristic networks
of suspended magnetic pods.

108
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:24,361
And we can keep climbing, and fly.

109
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:27,190
The fact that a company like Airbus

110
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:30,522
is now seriously working
on flying urban taxis

111
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:31,919
is telling us something.

112
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:37,501
Flying cars are finally moving
from science-fiction déjà vu

113
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,214
to attractive business-case territory.

114
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,848
And that's an exciting moment.

115
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:45,044
So building this 3-D
transportation network

116
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:50,386
is one of the ways we can mitigate
and solve traffic jams.

117
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,820
But it's not the only one.

118
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,875
We have to question

119
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,666
other fundamental choices
that we made, like the vehicles we use.

120
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:00,618
Just imagine a very familiar scene:

121
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,116
You've been driving for 42 minutes.

122
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,379
The two kids behind you
are getting restless.

123
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,104
And you're late.

124
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:11,019
Do you see that slow car in front of you?

125
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:13,292
Always comes when you're late, right?

126
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,451
(Laughter)

127
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,638
That driver is looking for parking.

128
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,410
There is no parking spot
available in the area,

129
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:20,777
but how would he know?

130
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:26,468
It is estimated that up to 30 percent
of urban traffic is generated

131
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:28,217
by drivers looking for parking.

132
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,965
Do you see the 100 cars around you?

133
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:34,160
Eighty-five of them
only have one passenger.

134
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:38,791
Those 85 drivers could all fit
in one Londonian red bus.

135
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,490
So the question is:

136
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,574
Why are we wasting so much space
if it is what we need the most?

137
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,360
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

138
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,700
Biology would never do this.

139
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,236
Space inside our arteries
is fully utilized.

140
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,246
At every heartbeat,

141
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,283
a higher blood pressure literally compacts
millions of red blood cells

142
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,425
into massive trains of oxygen

143
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,338
that quickly flow throughout our body.

144
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:05,701
And the tiny space inside our red
blood cells is not wasted, either.

145
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,074
In healthy conditions,

146
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:12,136
more than 95 percent
of their oxygen capacity is utilized.

147
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:15,355
Can you imagine if the vehicles
we used in our cities

148
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,063
were 95 percent full,

149
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:20,471
all the additional space
you would have to walk, to bike

150
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,033
and to enjoy our cities?

151
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:26,129
The reason blood is so
incredibly efficient

152
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,254
is that our red blood cells
are not dedicated

153
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,132
to specific organs or tissues;

154
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,608
otherwise, we would probably have
traffic jams in our veins.

155
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:35,864
No, they're shared.

156
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,264
They're shared by all
the cells of our body.

157
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,390
And because our network is so extensive,

158
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:46,174
each one of our 37 trillion cells
gets its own deliveries of oxygen

159
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,727
precisely when it needs them.

160
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:52,843
Blood is both a collective
and individual form of transportation.

161
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,057
But for our cities,

162
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,365
we've been stuck.

163
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,434
We've been stuck in an endless debate

164
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:03,675
between creating a car-centric society
or extensive mass-transit systems.

165
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:05,910
I think we should transcend this.

166
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:10,253
I think we can create vehicles
that combine the convenience of cars

167
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,594
and the efficiencies of trains and buses.

168
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,864
Just imagine.

169
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:19,136
You're comfortably sitting
in a fast and smooth urban train,

170
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,271
along with 1,200 passengers.

171
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,637
The problem with urban trains

172
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:28,056
is that sometimes you have to stop
five, ten, fifteen times

173
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,621
before your final destination.

174
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:33,332
What if in this train
you didn't have to stop?

175
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,198
In this train,

176
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,451
wagons can detach dynamically
while you're moving

177
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,494
and become express, driverless buses

178
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,571
that move on a secondary road network.

179
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,925
And so without a single stop,

180
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,536
nor a lengthy transfer,

181
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,969
you are now sitting in a bus
that is headed toward your suburb.

182
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,573
And when you get close,

183
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:56,904
the section you're sitting in detaches

184
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:59,878
and self-drives you
right to your doorstep.

185
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,184
It is collective and individual
at the same time.

186
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:08,799
This could be one of the shared,
modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.

187
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:10,842
Now ...

188
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,375
as if walking in a city
buzzing with drones,

189
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,686
flying taxis, modular buses
and suspended magnetic pods

190
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,161
was not exotic enough,

191
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,999
I think there is another force in action

192
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,604
that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.

193
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,130
If you think about it,

194
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:33,160
the current generation of driverless cars
is just trying to earn its way

195
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:36,214
into a traffic grid
made by and for humans.

196
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:40,039
They're trying to learn traffic rules,
which is relatively simple,

197
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,460
and coping with human unpredictability,

198
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:44,096
which is more challenging.

199
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:48,490
But what would happen
when whole cities become driverless?

200
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,827
Would we need traffic lights?

201
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,447
Would we need lanes?

202
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:53,970
How about speed limits?

203
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,852
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.

204
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:59,363
They never stop at red lights.

205
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,363
In the first driverless cities,

206
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:03,504
you would have no red lights and no lanes.

207
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:07,087
And when all the cars
are driverless and connected,

208
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,195
everything is predictable
and reaction time, minimum.

209
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,133
They can drive much faster

210
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:16,094
and can take any rational initiative
that can speed them up

211
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:17,475
or the cars around them.

212
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,275
So instead of rigid traffic rules,

213
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:23,535
flow will be regulated

214
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,386
by a mesh of dynamic and constantly
self-improving algorithms.

215
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:33,195
The result: a strange traffic

216
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:36,730
that mixes the fast and smooth
rigor of German autobahns

217
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:40,054
and the creative vitality
of the intersections of Mumbai.

218
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,254
(Laughter)

219
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,233
Traffic will be functionally exuberant.

220
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,698
It will be liquid like our blood.

221
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,478
And by a strange paradox,

222
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:51,313
the more robotized
our traffic grid will be,

223
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,093
the more organic and alive
its movement will feel.

224
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,852
So yes,

225
00:10:56,876 --> 00:11:00,574
biology has all the attributes
of a transportation genius today.

226
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:03,407
But this process has taken
billions of years,

227
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:06,433
and went through all sorts
of iterations and mutations.

228
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,320
We can't wait billions of years
to evolve our transportation system.

229
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,807
We now have the dreams,

230
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,123
the concepts

231
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,453
and the technology

232
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:19,327
to create 3-D transportation networks,

233
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,066
invent new vehicles

234
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,714
and change the flow in our cities.

235
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,264
Let's do it.

236
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:25,452
Thank you.

237
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,309
(Applause)
