00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:19,804
(Clicking)

1
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:24,420
I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,

2
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,353
retinal cancer.

3
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:30,419
My right eye was removed

4
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,336
at seven months of age.

5
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:37,053
I was 13 months
when they removed my left eye.

6
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:43,148
The first thing I did
upon awakening from that last surgery

7
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:46,780
was to climb out of my crib

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,889
and begin wandering around
the intensive care nursery,

9
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,208
probably looking for the one
who did this to me.

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,066
(Laughter)

11
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,127
Evidently, wandering around the nursery

12
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:05,702
was not a problem for me without eyes.

13
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,337
The problem was getting caught.

14
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:12,731
It's impressions about blindness

15
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:16,221
that are far more threatening

16
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:19,753
to blind people than the blindness itself.

17
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:25,230
Think for a moment about
your own impressions of blindness.

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,296
Think about your reactions
when I first came onto the stage,

19
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:33,347
or the prospect of your own blindness,

20
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:37,264
or a loved one going blind.

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:42,704
The terror is incomprehensible
to most of us,

22
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:45,159
because blindness

23
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,829
is thought to epitomize ignorance
and unawareness,

24
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:58,630
hapless exposure to the ravages
of the dark unknown.

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,460
How poetic.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,801
Fortunately for me,
my parents were not poetic.

27
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,676
They were pragmatic.

28
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:13,293
They understood that ignorance and fear
were but matters of the mind,

29
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:17,282
and the mind is adaptable.

30
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,983
They believed that I should grow up

31
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:25,814
to enjoy the same freedoms
and responsibilities as everyone else.

32
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,275
In their own words, I would move out --

33
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:31,062
which I did when I was 18 --

34
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,035
I will pay taxes --

35
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,875
thanks --
(Laughter) --

36
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:42,786
and they knew the difference
between love and fear.

37
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:47,710
Fear immobilizes us
in the face of challenge.

38
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,612
They knew that blindness
would pose a significant challenge.

39
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:53,666
I was not raised with fear.

40
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,415
They put my freedom first before all else,

41
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,535
because that is what love does.

42
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:04,764
Now, moving forward,
how do I manage today?

43
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:09,419
The world is a much larger nursery.

44
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,320
Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,014
longer than the canes
used by most blind people.

46
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:19,357
I call it my freedom staff.

47
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,913
It will keep me, for example,

48
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:26,529
from making an undignified
departure from the stage. (Laughter)

49
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,242
I do see that cliff edge.

50
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,509
They warned us earlier
that every imaginable mishap

51
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,100
has occurred to speakers
up here on the stage.

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,121
I don't care to set a new precedent.

53
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,425
But beyond that,

54
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:45,552
many of you may have heard me clicking
as I came onto the stage --

55
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,619
(Clicking) --

56
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,488
with my tongue.

57
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,666
Those are flashes of sound

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:56,746
that go out and reflect
from surfaces all around me,

59
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,118
just like a bat's sonar,

60
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:03,738
and return to me with patterns,
with pieces of information,

61
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:06,225
much as light does for you.

62
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:10,793
And my brain, thanks to my parents,

63
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:16,098
has been activated to form images
in my visual cortex,

64
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:19,338
which we now call the imaging system,

65
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:23,288
from those patterns of information,
much as your brain does.

66
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,854
I call this process flash sonar.

67
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:32,322
It is how I have learned to see
through my blindness,

68
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,498
to navigate my journey

69
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:39,538
through the dark unknowns
of my own challenges,

70
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:43,439
which has earned me the moniker

71
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,154
"the remarkable Batman."

72
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,708
Now, Batman I will accept.

73
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,098
Bats are cool. Batman is cool.

74
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:58,766
But I was not raised to think of myself
as in any way remarkable.

75
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,884
I have always regarded myself
much like anyone else

76
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:09,300
who navigates the dark unknowns
of their own challenges.

77
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,718
Is that so remarkable?

78
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:16,014
I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.

79
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:19,317
Now, someone, somewhere,

80
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:23,144
must think that's remarkable,
or I wouldn't be up here,

81
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:26,183
but let's consider this for a moment.

82
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,739
Everyone out there

83
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:34,428
who faces or who has ever
faced a challenge,

84
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,160
raise your hands.

85
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,490
Whoosh. Okay.

86
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,462
Lots of hands going up, a moment,
let me do a head count.

87
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,503
(Clicking)

88
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,731
This will take a while.
(Clicking) (Laughter)

89
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,205
Okay, lots of hands in the air.

90
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:52,609
Keep them up. I have an idea.

91
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:58,302
Those of you who use your brains
to navigate these challenges,

92
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:01,243
put your hands down.

93
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:05,024
Okay, anyone with your hands still up

94
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:10,262
has challenges of your own. (Laughter)

95
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,839
So we all face challenges,

96
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,577
and we all face the dark unknown,

97
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,920
which is endemic to most challenges,
which is what most of us fear, okay?

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,773
But we all have brains

99
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:29,069
that allow us, that activate to allow us

100
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:35,456
to navigate the journey
through these challenges. Okay?

101
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:40,284
Case in point: I came up here

102
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:47,254
and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me

103
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:50,152
where the lectern was.

104
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:53,066
So you can't trust those TED folks.

105
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,653
"Find it yourself," they said.

106
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,063
So -- (Laughter)

107
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,525
And the feedback for the P.A. system
is no help at all.

108
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,934
So now I present to you a challenge.

109
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:11,850
So if you'd all close your eyes
for just a moment, okay?

110
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,507
And you're going to learn
a bit of flash sonar.

111
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,017
I'm going to make a sound.

112
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:20,562
I'm going to hold this panel in front
of me, but I'm not going to move it.

113
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:23,486
Just listen to the sound for a moment.

114
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:31,228
Shhhhhhhhhh.

115
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,293
Okay, nothing very interesting.

116
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:36,032
Now, listen to what happens
to that same exact sound

117
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,816
when I move the panel.

118
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:45,111
Shhhhhhhhhhh.
(Pitch getting higher and lower)

119
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:53,609
You do not know the power
of the dark side.

120
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,421
(Laughter)

121
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,812
I couldn't resist.

122
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,479
Okay, now keep your eyes closed

123
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,327
because, did you hear the difference?

124
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:07,425
Okay. Now, let's be sure.

125
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,224
For your challenge,

126
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:14,308
you tell me, just say "now"
when you hear the panel start to move.

127
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:17,300
Okay? We'll relax into this.

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,823
Shhhhhhh.

129
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:25,888
Audience: Now.
Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.

130
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,381
Open your eyes.

131
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,915
All right. So just a few centimeters,

132
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,045
you would notice the difference.

133
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,488
You've experienced sonar.

134
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,547
You'd all make great blind people.
(Laughter)

135
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:43,240
Let's have a look at what can happen

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,584
when this activation process

137
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:51,111
is given some time and attention.

138
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:54,292
(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like
you guys can see with your eyes

139
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,497
and we can see with our ears.

140
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,561
Brian Bushway: It's not a matter
of enjoying it more or less,

141
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,487
it's about enjoying it differently.

142
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,529
Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.
DK: Yeah.

143
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,337
SM: And then it's gradually
coming back down again.

144
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:11,950
DK: Yes!
SM: That's amazing.

145
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,246
I can, like, see the car. Holy mother!

146
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,048
J. Louchart: I love being blind.

147
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:27,716
If I had the opportunity, honestly,
I wouldn't go back to being sighted.

148
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:31,176
JR: The bigger the goal,
the more obstacles you'll face,

149
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,777
and on the other side of that goal

150
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,425
is victory.

151
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:40,580
[In Italian]

152
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:50,355
(Applause)

153
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:54,245
DK: Now, do these people look terrified?

154
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,067
Not so much.

155
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,853
We have delivered activation training

156
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:02,382
to tens of thousands of blind
and sighted people from all backgrounds

157
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,820
in nearly 40 countries.

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,302
When blind people learn to see,

159
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,320
sighted people seem inspired

160
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,377
to want to learn to see their way
better, more clearly, with less fear,

161
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:24,533
because this exemplifies
the immense capacity within us all

162
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:31,046
to navigate any type of challenge,
through any form of darkness,

163
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,332
to discoveries unimagined

164
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:39,695
when we are activated.

165
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:45,709
I wish you all a most activating journey.

166
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,474
Thank you very much.

167
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:54,695
(Applause)

168
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:58,162
Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.

169
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:03,297
As I know you can see, it's
a spectacular standing ovation at TED.

170
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,281
Thank you for an extraordinary talk.

171
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:11,530
Just one more question about your world,
your inner world that you construct.

172
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,095
We think that we have things in our world
that you as a blind person don't have,

173
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,819
but what's your world like?

174
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,582
What do you have that we don't have?

175
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,717
DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,

176
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,618
so my sonar works about as well
behind me as it does in front of me.

177
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,499
It works around corners.

178
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:33,238
It works through surfaces.

179
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:39,229
Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy
three-dimensional geometry.

180
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:43,269
One of my students, who has now
become an instructor,

181
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,195
when he lost his vision,
after a few months

182
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,447
he was sitting in his three story house

183
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:52,464
and he realized that he could hear
everything going on throughout the house:

184
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:56,643
conversations, people in the kitchen,
people in the bathroom,

185
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:59,337
several floors away, several walls away.

186
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,889
He said it was something
like having x-ray vision.

187
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,511
CA: What do you picture
that you're in right now?

188
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:09,530
How do you picture this theater?

189
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:15,033
DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.

190
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:20,709
It's interesting.
When people make a sound,

191
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,864
when they laugh, when they fidget,
when they take a drink or blow their nose

192
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:28,557
or whatever, I hear everything.

193
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:31,738
I hear every little movement
that every single person makes.

194
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:34,501
None of it really escapes my attention,

195
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,355
and then, from a sonar perspective,

196
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:42,209
the size of the room, the curvature
of the audience around the stage,

197
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,847
it's the height of the room.

198
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:49,127
Like I say, it's all that kind
of three-dimensional surface geometry

199
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,544
all around me.

200
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,830
CA: Well, Daniel, you have done
a spectacular job

201
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,655
of helping us all see the world
in a different way.

202
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,825
Thanks so much for that, truly.
DK: Thank you.

203
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:02,214
(Applause)
