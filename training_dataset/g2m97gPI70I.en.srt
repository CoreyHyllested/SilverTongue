0
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,501
I'll never forget the sound

1
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:17,587
of laughing with my friends.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,796
I'll never forget the sound

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,275
of my mother's voice
right before I fell asleep.

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,689
And I'll never forget
the comforting sound of water

5
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:32,731
trickling down a stream.

6
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,969
Imagine my fear, pure fear,

7
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,386
when, at the age of 10,

8
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:43,569
I was told I was going to lose my hearing.

9
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,450
And over the next five years,

10
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:52,004
it progressed until I was classified
as profoundly deaf.

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,685
But I believe that losing my hearing

12
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:01,162
was one of the greatest gifts
I've ever received.

13
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:05,924
You see, I get to experience
the world in a unique way.

14
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,929
And I believe that
these unique experiences

15
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:13,340
that people with disabilities have

16
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:18,384
is what's going to help us
make and design a better world

17
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:23,748
for everyone -- both for people
with and without disabilities.

18
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,419
I used to be a disability rights lawyer,

19
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:31,093
and I spent a lot of my time
focused on enforcing the law,

20
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:33,268
ensuring that accommodations were made.

21
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:38,360
And then I had to quickly
learn international policy,

22
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:42,266
because I was asked to work
on the UN Convention

23
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,593
that protects people with disabilities.

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,391
As the leader of the NGO there,

25
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:53,073
I spent most of my energy
trying to convince people

26
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:56,341
about the capabilities
of people with disabilities.

27
00:01:57,775 --> 00:02:00,260
But somewhere along the way,

28
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,087
and after many career transitions

29
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,158
that my parents weren't so happy about --

30
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,768
(Laughter)

31
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,899
I stumbled upon a solution

32
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:15,283
that I believe may be
an even more powerful tool

33
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:18,617
to solve some of the world's
greatest problems,

34
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,321
disability or not.

35
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,003
And that tool is called design thinking.

36
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:32,842
Design thinking is a process
for innovation and problem solving.

37
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,549
There are five steps.

38
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,148
The first is defining the problem

39
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,427
and understanding its constraints.

40
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:46,497
The second is observing people
in real-life situations

41
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,821
and empathizing with them.

42
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:52,815
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --
the more the better,

43
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,373
the wilder the better.

44
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:59,720
Fourth, prototyping:
gathering whatever you can,

45
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,196
whatever you can find,

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,819
to mimic your solution, to test it

47
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,275
and to refine it.

48
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,409
And finally, implementation:

49
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:13,491
ensuring that the solution
you came up with is sustainable.

50
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:21,575
Warren Berger says that design thinking
teaches us to look sideways,

51
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,599
to reframe, to refine, to experiment

52
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,970
and, probably most importantly,

53
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:30,551
ask those stupid questions.

54
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,686
Design thinkers believe
that everyone is creative.

55
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,428
They believe in bringing people
from multiple disciplines together,

56
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:44,667
because they want to share
multiple perspectives

57
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,107
and bring them together
and ultimately merge them

58
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,384
to form something new.

59
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,610
Design thinking is such a successful
and versatile tool

60
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,705
that it has been applied
in almost every industry.

61
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:04,961
I saw the potential that it had
for the issues I faced,

62
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:08,217
so I decided to go back to school

63
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,111
and get my master's in social design.

64
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:16,971
This looks at how to use design
to create positive change in the world.

65
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,630
While I was there,

66
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,471
I fell in love with woodworking.

67
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,914
But what I quickly realized

68
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,382
was that I was missing out on something.

69
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,997
As you're working with a tool,

70
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,450
right before it's about
to kick back at you --

71
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,733
which means the piece or the tool
jumps back at you --

72
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:37,923
it makes a sound.

73
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,582
And I couldn't hear this sound.

74
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,268
So I decided,

75
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,323
why not try and solve it?

76
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:49,847
My solution was a pair of safety glasses

77
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,663
that were engineered
to visually alert the user

78
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,279
to pitch changes in the tool,

79
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:59,175
before the human ear could pick it up.

80
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:04,668
Why hadn't tool designers
thought of this before?

81
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,595
(Laughter)

82
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:10,410
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

83
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:15,411
I wasn't weighed down by expertise
or conventional wisdom.

84
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,729
The second is: I was Deaf.

85
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,013
My unique experience of the world
helped inform my solution.

86
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:29,839
And as I went on, I kept running into
more and more solutions

87
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,435
that were originally made
for people with disabilities,

88
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,765
and that ended up being picked up,

89
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,711
embraced and loved by the mainstream,

90
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:40,940
disability or not.

91
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,862
This is an OXO potato peeler.

92
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,508
It was originally designed
for people with arthritis,

93
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,959
but it was so comfortable,
everybody loved it.

94
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:56,198
Text messaging: that was originally
designed for people who are Deaf.

95
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,067
And as you know,
everybody loves that, too.

96
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,009
(Laughter)

97
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,746
I started thinking:

98
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,618
What if we changed our mindset?

99
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:12,706
What if we started designing
for disability first --

100
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,007
not the norm?

101
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,511
As you see, when we design
for disability first,

102
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:23,356
we often stumble upon
solutions that are not only inclusive,

103
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,216
but also are often better
than when we design for the norm.

104
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:31,953
And this excites me,

105
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:38,301
because this means that the energy
it takes to accommodate someone

106
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,926
with a disability

107
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,813
can be leveraged, molded and played with

108
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,860
as a force for creativity and innovation.

109
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:55,245
This moves us from the mindset
of trying to change the hearts

110
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,392
and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,

111
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,134
to becoming an alchemist,

112
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:05,128
the type of magician that this world
so desperately needs

113
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:07,475
to solve some of its greatest problems.

114
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,894
Now, I also believe

115
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,437
that people with disabilities
have great potential to be designers

116
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,809
within this design-thinking process.

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,343
Without knowing it, from a very early age,

118
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,622
I've been a design thinker,
fine-tuning my skills.

119
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:31,029
Design thinkers are, by nature,
problem solvers.

120
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,885
So imagine listening to a conversation

121
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,902
and only understanding
50 percent of what is said.

122
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,538
You can't ask them to repeat
every single word.

123
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,476
They would just get frustrated with you.

124
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,240
So without even realizing it,

125
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:55,176
my solution was to take
the muffled sound I heard,

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,352
that was the beat,

127
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,886
and turn it into a rhythm
and place it with the lips I read.

128
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:07,581
Years later, someone commented
that my writing had a rhythm to it.

129
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:13,066
Well, this is because I experience
conversations as rhythms.

130
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,444
I also became really,
really good at failing.

131
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:20,702
(Laughter)

132
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,300
Quite literally.

133
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,882
My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.

134
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,383
But what I learned
was that when I picked myself up

135
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,707
and changed a few things around,

136
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,546
eventually, I succeeded.

137
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:41,807
Similarly, design thinking
encourages people to fail

138
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,467
and fail often,

139
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,722
because eventually, you will succeed.

140
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:51,284
Very few great innovations in this world

141
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:55,126
have come from someone succeeding
on the first try.

142
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:59,778
I also experienced this lesson in sports.

143
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,421
I'll never forget my coach
saying to my mom,

144
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,623
"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,

145
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,331
she would be on the national team."

146
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:16,242
But what my coach, and what I
didn't even know at the time,

147
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,723
was that my hearing loss
actually helped me excel at sports.

148
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:27,771
You see, when you lose your hearing,
not only do you adapt your behavior,

149
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,577
but you also adapt your physical senses.

150
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,435
One example of this

151
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,962
is that my visual
attention span increased.

152
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:44,001
Imagine a soccer player,
coming down the left flank.

153
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,828
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,

154
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,000
and the ball is coming
down the left flank.

155
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:53,808
A person with normal hearing
would have the visual perspective of this.

156
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:58,863
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.

157
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,324
So I picked up the players over here,

158
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,862
that were moving about
and coming down the field.

159
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:07,560
And I picked them up quicker,
so that if the ball was passed,

160
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:11,177
I could reposition myself
and be ready for that shot.

161
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:14,472
So as you can see,

162
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:17,162
I've been a design thinker
for nearly all my life.

163
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:23,346
My observation skills have been honed
so that I pick up on things

164
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,353
that others would never pick up on.

165
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:31,197
My constant need to adapt
has made me a great ideator

166
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:32,538
and problem solver.

167
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:37,664
And I've often had to do this
within limitations and constraints.

168
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:42,439
This is something that designers
also have to deal with frequently.

169
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:47,527
My work most recently took me to Haiti.

170
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:52,238
Design thinkers often seek out
extreme situations,

171
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:56,517
because that often informs
some of their best designs.

172
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,580
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.

173
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:04,822
I lived and worked
with 300 Deaf individuals

174
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:08,775
that were relocated
after the 2010 earthquake.

175
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,971
But five and a half years later,

176
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,698
there still was no electricity;

177
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,208
there still was no safe drinking water;

178
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:20,373
there were still no job opportunities;

179
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,429
there was still rampant crime,
and it went unpunished.

180
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,540
International aid organizations
came one by one.

181
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,351
But they came

182
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,071
with pre-determined solutions.

183
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:37,482
They didn't come ready
to observe and to adapt

184
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:41,511
based on the community's needs.

185
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,789
One organization gave them
goats and chickens.

186
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:48,793
But they didn't realize

187
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:52,736
that there was so much hunger
in that community,

188
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,586
that when the Deaf went to sleep
at night and couldn't hear,

189
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,874
people broke into their yards
and their homes

190
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,779
and stole these chickens and goats,

191
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,344
and eventually they were all gone.

192
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,425
Now, if that organization
had taken the time

193
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,186
to observe Deaf people,
to observe the community,

194
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,249
they would have realized their problem

195
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:23,669
and perhaps they would have
come up with a solution,

196
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,771
something like a solar light,

197
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:30,976
lighting up a secure pen
to put them in at night

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,380
to ensure their safety.

199
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:37,989
You don't have to be a design thinker

200
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:41,218
to insert the ideas
I've shared with you today.

201
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,051
You are creative.

202
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,295
You are a designer --

203
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,765
everyone is.

204
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:55,371
Let people like me help you.

205
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,855
Let people with disabilities
help you look sideways,

206
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,441
and in the process,

207
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,074
solve some of the greatest problems.

208
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:06,952
That's it. Thank you.

209
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:12,492
(Applause)
