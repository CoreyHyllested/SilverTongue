00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:17,793
This is a painting from the 16th century
from Lucas Cranach the Elder.

1
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,926
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.

2
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:27,034
If you drink its water or you bathe in it,
you will get health and youth.

3
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:33,406
Every culture, every civilization
has dreamed of finding eternal youth.

4
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:38,796
There are people like Alexander the Great
or Ponce De LeÃ³n, the explorer,

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,251
who spent much of their life
chasing the Fountain of Youth.

6
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:43,894
They didn't find it.

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,050
But what if there was something to it?

8
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:50,773
What if there was something
to this Fountain of Youth?

9
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:56,462
I will share an absolutely amazing
development in aging research

10
00:00:56,486 --> 00:01:00,096
that could revolutionize
the way we think about aging

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,322
and how we may treat age-related
diseases in the future.

12
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:06,654
It started with experiments that showed,

13
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:09,972
in a recent number
of studies about growing,

14
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:15,997
that animals -- old mice --
that share a blood supply with young mice

15
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,625
can get rejuvenated.

16
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:22,757
This is similar to what you might see
in humans, in Siamese twins,

17
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,869
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.

18
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:31,285
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
researcher, reported in 2007,

19
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:34,809
was that old muscle from a mouse
can be rejuvenated

20
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:39,462
if it's exposed to young blood
through common circulation.

21
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:44,546
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,

22
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,165
and others then showed that similar
rejuvenating effects could be observed

23
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,975
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.

24
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:57,071
But what I'm most excited about,
and several other labs as well,

25
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,514
is that this may even apply to the brain.

26
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:06,046
So, what we found is that an old mouse
exposed to a young environment

27
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,083
in this model called parabiosis,

28
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:10,899
shows a younger brain --

29
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,105
and a brain that functions better.

30
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,556
And I repeat:

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,793
an old mouse that gets young blood
through shared circulation

32
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,801
looks younger and functions
younger in its brain.

33
00:02:25,998 --> 00:02:27,530
So when we get older --

34
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:30,226
we can look at different aspects
of human cognition,

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,003
and you can see on this slide here,

36
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,410
we can look at reasoning,
verbal ability and so forth.

37
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:41,178
And up to around age 50 or 60,
these functions are all intact,

38
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,684
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.

39
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,716
(Laughter)

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,547
But it's scary to see
how all these curves go south.

41
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,160
And as we get older,

42
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:56,235
diseases such as Alzheimer's
and others may develop.

43
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:00,575
We know that with age,
the connections between neurons --

44
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,250
the way neurons talk to each other,
the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;

45
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:08,580
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,

46
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:12,596
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.

47
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:18,482
One big problem we have -- to try
to understand how this really works

48
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:21,102
at a very molecular mechanistic level --

49
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:25,176
is that we can't study the brains
in detail, in living people.

50
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,019
We can do cognitive tests,
we can do imaging --

51
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,739
all kinds of sophisticated testing.

52
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:35,381
But we usually have to wait
until the person dies

53
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:40,499
to get the brain and look at how it really
changed through age or in a disease.

54
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,952
This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.

55
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:50,000
So, how about we think of the brain
as being part of the larger organism.

56
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,501
Could we potentially understand more

57
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,454
about what happens in the brain
at the molecular level

58
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:59,064
if we see the brain
as part of the entire body?

59
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:03,965
So if the body ages or gets sick,
does that affect the brain?

60
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,412
And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
does that influence the rest of the body?

61
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,541
And what connects all the different
tissues in the body

62
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:13,715
is blood.

63
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:20,191
Blood is the tissue that not only carries
cells that transport oxygen, for example,

64
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:21,456
the red blood cells,

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,680
or fights infectious diseases,

66
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:27,975
but it also carries messenger molecules,

67
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,911
hormone-like factors
that transport information

68
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:36,068
from one cell to another,
from one tissue to another,

69
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,549
including the brain.

70
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:42,711
So if we look at how the blood
changes in disease or age,

71
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:45,098
can we learn something about the brain?

72
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:50,487
We know that as we get older,
the blood changes as well,

73
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,470
so these hormone-like factors
change as we get older.

74
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,693
And by and large,
factors that we know are required

75
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:01,138
for the development of tissues,
for the maintenance of tissues --

76
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:04,039
they start to decrease as we get older,

77
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,766
while factors involved in repair,
in injury and in inflammation --

78
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,740
they increase as we get older.

79
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:15,806
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.

80
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:19,981
And to illustrate what we can do
potentially with that,

81
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,657
I want to talk you through
an experiment that we did.

82
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,330
We had almost 300 blood samples
from healthy human beings

83
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,871
20 to 89 years of age,

84
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,790
and we measured over 100
of these communication factors,

85
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:36,908
these hormone-like proteins that
transport information between tissues.

86
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,942
And what we noticed first

87
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,783
is that between the youngest
and the oldest group,

88
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,104
about half the factors
changed significantly.

89
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:48,263
So our body lives in a very
different environment as we get older,

90
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,038
when it comes to these factors.

91
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:53,558
And using statistical
or bioinformatics programs,

92
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:58,276
we could try to discover
those factors that best predict age --

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,943
in a way, back-calculate
the relative age of a person.

94
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:05,193
And the way this looks
is shown in this graph.

95
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:10,987
So, on the one axis you see
the actual age a person lived,

96
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,316
the chronological age.

97
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,062
So, how many years they lived.

98
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:16,794
And then we take these top factors
that I showed you,

99
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:21,662
and we calculate their relative age,
their biological age.

100
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,342
And what you see is that
there is a pretty good correlation,

101
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,681
so we can pretty well predict
the relative age of a person.

102
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:33,620
But what's really exciting
are the outliers,

103
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,448
as they so often are in life.

104
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:40,490
You can see here, the person
I highlighted with the green dot

105
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,110
is about 70 years of age

106
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:48,140
but seems to have a biological age,
if what we're doing here is really true,

107
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:50,207
of only about 45.

108
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:53,715
So is this a person that actually
looks much younger than their age?

109
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:58,699
But more importantly: Is this a person
who is maybe at a reduced risk

110
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:02,047
to develop an age-related disease
and will have a long life --

111
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,566
will live to 100 or more?

112
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:08,963
On the other hand, the person here,
highlighted with the red dot,

113
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:13,893
is not even 40,
but has a biological age of 65.

114
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:18,315
Is this a person at an increased risk
of developing an age-related disease?

115
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,995
So in our lab, we're trying
to understand these factors better,

116
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:24,257
and many other groups
are trying to understand,

117
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:26,357
what are the true aging factors,

118
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:31,354
and can we learn something about them
to possibly predict age-related diseases?

119
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:36,343
So what I've shown you so far
is simply correlational, right?

120
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:40,398
You can just say,
"Well, these factors change with age,"

121
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:44,077
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.

122
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,079
So what I'm going to show you now
is very remarkable

123
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:53,174
and it suggests that these factors
can actually modulate the age of a tissue.

124
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,143
And that's where we come back
to this model called parabiosis.

125
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,707
So, parabiosis is done in mice

126
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:04,643
by surgically connecting
the two mice together,

127
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,000
and that leads then
to a shared blood system,

128
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:11,811
where we can now ask,
"How does the old brain get influenced

129
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,573
by exposure to the young blood?"

130
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,348
And for this purpose, we use young mice

131
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,825
that are an equivalency
of 20-year-old people,

132
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,185
and old mice that are roughly
65 years old in human years.

133
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,784
What we found is quite remarkable.

134
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,528
We find there are more neural stem cells
that make new neurons

135
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,884
in these old brains.

136
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,933
There's an increased
activity of the synapses,

137
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,996
the connections between neurons.

138
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,305
There are more genes expressed
that are known to be involved

139
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,076
in the formation of new memories.

140
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,167
And there's less of this bad inflammation.

141
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:53,923
But we observed that there are no cells
entering the brains of these animals.

142
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,333
So when we connect them,

143
00:08:55,357 --> 00:09:00,733
there are actually no cells
going into the old brain, in this model.

144
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,040
Instead, we've reasoned, then,
that it must be the soluble factors,

145
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:09,847
so we could collect simply the soluble
fraction of blood which is called plasma,

146
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,815
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,

147
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,207
and we could reproduce
these rejuvenating effects,

148
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,945
but what we could also do now

149
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,419
is we could do memory tests with mice.

150
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:24,296
As mice get older, like us humans,
they have memory problems.

151
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,411
It's just harder to detect them,

152
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,779
but I'll show you in a minute
how we do that.

153
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,498
But we wanted to take this
one step further,

154
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:35,562
one step closer to potentially
being relevant to humans.

155
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,783
What I'm showing you now
are unpublished studies,

156
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:43,340
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,

157
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,213
and as a control, saline,

158
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:47,113
and injected it into old mice,

159
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:51,989
and asked, can we again
rejuvenate these old mice?

160
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:53,673
Can we make them smarter?

161
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,393
And to do this, we used a test.
It's called a Barnes maze.

162
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,572
This is a big table
that has lots of holes in it,

163
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:04,079
and there are guide marks around it,

164
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,709
and there's a bright light,
as on this stage here.

165
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,866
The mice hate this and they try to escape,

166
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,146
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,

167
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,115
where a tube is mounted underneath

168
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,332
where they can escape
and feel comfortable in a dark hole.

169
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,779
So we teach them, over several days,

170
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,706
to find this space
on these cues in the space,

171
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,524
and you can compare this for humans,

172
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:31,778
to finding your car in a parking lot
after a busy day of shopping.

173
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:32,803
(Laughter)

174
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:36,578
Many of us have probably had
some problems with that.

175
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,620
So, let's look at an old mouse here.

176
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:41,130
This is an old mouse
that has memory problems,

177
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,843
as you'll notice in a moment.

178
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:48,029
It just looks into every hole,
but it didn't form this spacial map

179
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:53,300
that would remind it where it was
in the previous trial or the last day.

180
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:59,340
In stark contrast, this mouse here
is a sibling of the same age,

181
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:04,783
but it was treated with young
human plasma for three weeks,

182
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,340
with small injections every three days.

183
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,964
And as you noticed, it almost
looks around, "Where am I?" --

184
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,895
and then walks straight
to that hole and escapes.

185
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,783
So, it could remember where that hole was.

186
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:22,430
So by all means, this old mouse
seems to be rejuvenated --

187
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:24,833
it functions more like a younger mouse.

188
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,563
And it also suggests
that there is something

189
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:32,578
not only in young mouse plasma,
but in young human plasma

190
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:36,262
that has the capacity
to help this old brain.

191
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:37,986
So to summarize,

192
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,209
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.

193
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:45,684
They're not set in stone;
we can actually change them.

194
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,181
It can be rejuvenated.

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,277
Young blood factors can reverse aging,

196
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,013
and what I didn't show you --

197
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:57,259
in this model, the young mouse actually
suffers from exposure to the old.

198
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,663
So there are old-blood factors
that can accelerate aging.

199
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:06,042
And most importantly,
humans may have similar factors,

200
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:10,144
because we can take young human
blood and have a similar effect.

201
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:14,148
Old human blood, I didn't show you,
does not have this effect;

202
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,934
it does not make the mice younger.

203
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,699
So, is this magic transferable to humans?

204
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:24,352
We're running a small
clinical study at Stanford,

205
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,252
where we treat Alzheimer's patients
with mild disease

206
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:34,886
with a pint of plasma
from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,

207
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,505
and do this once a week for four weeks,

208
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,692
and then we look
at their brains with imaging.

209
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,894
We test them cognitively,

210
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:46,924
and we ask their caregivers
for daily activities of living.

211
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:50,867
What we hope is that there are
some signs of improvement

212
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,255
from this treatment.

213
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:55,314
And if that's the case,
that could give us hope

214
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,758
that what I showed you works in mice

215
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,560
might also work in humans.

216
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,836
Now, I don't think we will live forever.

217
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,292
But maybe we discovered

218
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:09,403
that the Fountain of Youth
is actually within us,

219
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,165
and it has just dried out.

220
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,402
And if we can turn it
back on a little bit,

221
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:19,053
maybe we can find the factors
that are mediating these effects,

222
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,664
we can produce these factors synthetically

223
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:25,701
and we can treat diseases of aging,
such as Alzheimer's disease

224
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:26,955
or other dementias.

225
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:28,433
Thank you very much.

226
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:31,750
(Applause)
