00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,260
Hi there.

1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm going to be talking a little bit about

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,260
music, machines and life.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,260
Or, more specifically,

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,260
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,260
for a music video.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,260
Some of you may recognize this image.

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,260
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,260
We'll be showing the video at the end,

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,260
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,260
what it is that they wanted.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,260
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,260
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
we were really excited because

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,260
they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
And we were very excited about this

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,260
because, of course,

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,260
they have a history of dancing with machines.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,260
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
50-million-plus views on YouTube.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,260
Four guys dancing on treadmills,

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
no cuts, just a static camera.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,260
So we were really excited about working with them.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,260
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,260
And they explained that they wanted

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,260
kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,260
Now, for those of you who don't know,

28
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
a Rube Goldberg machine

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
is a complicated contraption,

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,260
an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,260
that accomplishes a relatively simple task.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
So we were excited by this idea,

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,260
and we started talking about

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
exactly what it would look like.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
And we came up with some parameters, because,

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,260
you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,260
has limitations,

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,260
but it also is pretty wide open.

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
And we wanted to make sure that we did something

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,260
that would work for a music video.

41
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,260
So we came up with a list of requirements,

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
the "10 commandments,"

43
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,260
and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
The first is "No magic."

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,260
Everything that happened on screen had to be

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,260
very easily understood by a typical viewer.

47
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,260
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
then we couldn't use it in the video.

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
They wanted band integration,

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,260
that is, the machine acting upon the band members,

51
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
specifically not the other way around.

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,260
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,260
So as the song picks up emotion,

54
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
so should the machine

55
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,260
get grander in its process.

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
They wanted us to make use of the space.

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,260
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,

58
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
divided between two floors.

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
It included an exterior loading dock.

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,260
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor

61
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,260
that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.

62
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,260
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.

63
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
The machine itself would start the music.

64
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
So the machine would get started,

65
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,260
it would travel some distance,

66
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
reacting along the way,

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
hit play on an iPod or a tape deck

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
or something that would start playback.

69
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,260
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.

70
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
And speaking of synchronization,

71
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,260
they wanted it to sync to the rhythm

72
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,260
and to hit specific beats along the way.

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,260
Okay. (Laughter)

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,260
They wanted it to end precisely on time.

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,260
And they wanted the music to drop out

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
at a certain point in the video

78
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
and actual live audio from the machine

79
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
to play part of the song.

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
And as if that wasn't enough,

81
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,260
all of these incredibly complicating things, right,

82
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
they wanted it in one shot.

83
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
(Laughter)

84
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,260
(Applause)

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Okay.

86
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
So, just some statistics

87
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
about what we went through in the process.

88
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
The machine itself has

89
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
89 distinct interactions.

90
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,260
It took us 85 takes

91
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,260
to get it on film

92
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
to our satisfaction.

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Of those 85 takes,

94
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,260
only three actually successfully completed their run.

95
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
We destroyed two pianos

96
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,260
and 10 televisions in the process.

97
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,260
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.

98
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
(Laughter)

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,260
And we lost one high-heeled shoe

100
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,260
left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,

102
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
and returned back to the build --

103
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
and left it in a pile of stuff.

104
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"

105
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.

106
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,260
And it's actually in the machine.

107
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
So what did we learn from all of this?

108
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
Well, having completed this,

109
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,260
we have the opportunity to step back and reflect

110
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
on some of the things.

111
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
And we learned that small stuff stinks.

112
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Little balls in wooden tracks

113
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
are really susceptible to

114
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,

115
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
and they fall out of the tracks,

116
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
the exact angles makes it hard to get right.

117
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,260
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.

118
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
It doesn't matter what temperature it is,

119
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
doesn't matter what's in its way;

120
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
it will pretty much get where it needs to go.

121
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,

122
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
so that we would have somewhere to go.

123
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,260
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.

124
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Small stuff stinks,

125
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
but, of course, it's essential, right?

126
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,260
What else? Planning is incredibly important.

127
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,260
(Laughter)

128
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating

129
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,260
and even building some of these things.

130
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
It's been said that, "No battle plan

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
survives contact with the enemy."

132
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
I think our enemy was physics --

133
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
(Laughter)

134
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,260
and she's a cruel mistress.

135
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
Often, we had to pull things out as a result

136
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,260
because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.

137
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
These are all things that ended up

139
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
not making it into the final machine.

140
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,260
So also, put reliable stuff last,

141
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
the stuff that's going to run every time.

142
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Again, small to large is relevant here.

143
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,260
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video

144
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
references the big, real car

145
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
near the end of the video.

146
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,260
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.

147
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track

148
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,260
and that's a problem.

149
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine

150
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.

151
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
So you put that up front so that, if it fails,

152
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
at least you know

153
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
you don't have to reset the whole thing.

154
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Life can be

155
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
messy.

156
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,260
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.

157
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.

158
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,260
And the wonderful elation that we had

159
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
when we finally completed it.

160
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,260
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,

161
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
"This Too Shall Pass."

162
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Thank you very much.

163
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,260
(Applause)

164
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
And now to introduce

165
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
their music video,

166
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
we have OK Go.

167
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.

168
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
We are OK Go.

169
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!

170
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.

171
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"

172
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.

173
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Let me start again.

174
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,260
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Tim's sundial hat.

176
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?

177
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Sorry, start again.

178
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,260
(Barking)

179
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
Dogs.

180
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,

181
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,260

(Music)

186
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,260
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

187
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,260
♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,260
♫ If there ain't all that much to lug around ♫

189
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,260
♫ Better run like hell when you hit the ground ♫

190
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

191
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

192
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,260
♫ You can't stop these kids from dancing ♫

193
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
♫ Why would you want to? ♫

194
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,260
♫ Especially when you're already getting yours ♫

195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,260
♫ Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend ♫

196
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,260
♫ Well don't go blaming the kids again ♫

197
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

198
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

199
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

♫ When the morning comes ♫

♫ When the morning comes ♫

202
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

203
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,260
♫ Let it go ♫

204
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,260
♫ This too shall pass ♫

205
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,260
♫ Let it go ♫

206
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,260
♫ This too shall pass ♫

207
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,260
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

208
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,260
♫ No, you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

209
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,260
♫ Let it go ♫

210
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,260
♫ This too shall pass ♫
