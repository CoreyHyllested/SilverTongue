0
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:16,432
My first love was for the night sky.

1
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:17,998
Love is complicated.

2
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:22,527
You're looking at a fly-through of the
Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,

3
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:26,639
one of the most distant images
of our universe ever observed.

4
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,153
Everything you see here is a galaxy,

5
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:32,160
comprised of billions of stars each.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,901
And the farthest galaxy is
a trillion, trillion kilometers away.

7
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:40,805
As an astrophysicist, I have
the awesome privilege of studying

8
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:44,252
some of the most exotic objects
in our universe.

9
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:48,064
The objects that have captivated me
from first crush throughout my career

10
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:52,473
are supermassive,
hyperactive black holes.

11
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:57,931
Weighing one to 10 billion times
the mass of our own sun,

12
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,825
these galactic black holes
are devouring material,

13
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:04,145
at a rate of upwards of
1,000 times more

14
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:07,512
than your "average"
supermassive black hole.

15
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:09,640
(Laughter)

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,334
These two characteristics,

17
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,548
with a few others, make them quasars.

18
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:17,465
At the same time, the objects I study

19
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:20,242
are producing some of the most
powerful particle streams

20
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:21,937
ever observed.

21
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:24,777
These narrow streams, called jets,

22
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:29,385
are moving at 99,99 percent
of the speed of light,

23
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:33,368
and are pointed directly at the Earth.

24
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:39,257
These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive
and supermassive black holes

25
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:43,801
are called blazars, or blazing quasars.

26
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,282
What makes blazars so special
is that they're some of the universe's

27
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:49,802
most efficient particle accelerators,

28
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:54,720
transporting incredible amounts
of energy throughout a galaxy.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,469
Here, I'm showing an
artist's conception of a blazar.

30
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,669
The dinner plate by which
material falls onto the black hole

31
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:02,256
is called the accretion disc,

32
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,082
shown here in blue.

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,061
Some of that material is slingshotted
around the black hole

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,085
and accelerated to insanely high speeds

35
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,912
in the jet, shown here in white.

36
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,599
Although the blazar system is rare,

37
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,606
the process by which nature
pulls in material via a disk,

38
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:20,883
and then flings some of it out via a jet,
is more common.

39
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,091
We'll eventually zoom out of
the blazar system

40
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:29,180
to show its approximate relationship
to the larger galactic context.

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,295
Beyond the cosmic accounting
of what goes in to what goes out,

42
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:41,342
one of the hot topics in
blazar astrophysics right now

43
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:45,053
is where the highest-energy
jet emission comes from.

44
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:48,974
In this image, I'm interested
in where this white blob forms

45
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:52,617
and if, as a result, there's any
relationship between the jet

46
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,483
and the accretion disc material.

47
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,286
Clear answers to this question

48
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,401
were almost completely
inaccessible until 2008,

49
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,675
when NASA launched a new telescope
that better detects gamma ray light --

50
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,387
that is, light with energies
a million times higher

51
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,934
than your standard x-ray scan.

52
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:14,824
I simultaneously compare variations
between the gamma ray light data

53
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:18,493
and the visible light data from
day to day and year to year,

54
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,767
to better localize these gamma ray blobs.

55
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,453
My research shows that in some instances,

56
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:27,513
these blobs form much closer
to the black hole

57
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:29,873
than we initially thought.

58
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:31,764
As we more confidently localize

59
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,060
where these gamma ray
blobs are forming,

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,583
we can better understand how jets
are being accelerated,

61
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,191
and ultimately reveal
the dynamic processes

62
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:44,886
by which some of the most fascinating
objects in our universe are formed.

63
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,501
This all started as a love story.

64
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,414
And it still is.

65
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:55,624
This love transformed me from
a curious, stargazing young girl

66
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,445
to a professional astrophysicist,

67
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,782
hot on the heels of celestial discovery.

68
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,202
Who knew that chasing after the universe

69
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:07,000
would ground me so deeply
to my mission here on Earth.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,468
Then again, when do we ever know
where love's first flutter

71
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:11,942
will truly take us.

72
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,171
Thank you.

73
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,471
(Applause)
