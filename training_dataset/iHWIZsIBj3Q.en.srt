0
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,024
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public

1
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,119
that it is possible to transmit a video

2
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:24,452
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

3
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:29,636
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.

4
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:33,069
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.

5
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,927
And you may wonder, what's the point?

6
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,695
And the point is this:

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,075
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet

8
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:43,909
to close the digital divide,

9
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:48,114
and also to allow for what we call
"The Internet of Things" --

10
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:51,304
tens of billions of devices
connected to the Internet.

11
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:55,359
In my view, such an extension
of the Internet can only work

12
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,730
if it's almost energy-neutral.

13
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:03,005
This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible.

14
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:08,434
And this is where the solar cell
and the LED come in.

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,277
I demonstrated for the first time,

16
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,266
at TED in 2011,

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,274
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

18
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:21,776
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,092
and also in a safe and secure manner.

20
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,283
Data is transported by the light,

21
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:31,432
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,954
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,

23
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:40,639
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

24
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:46,632
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,

25
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:50,338
to receive the information
encoded in the data.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,832
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure

27
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,862
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

28
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:02,540
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.

29
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:08,144
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.

30
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,535
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.

31
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,965
But now we need to remember

32
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:21,220
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,

33
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,593
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

34
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,548
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.

35
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,088
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place

36
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:38,222
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,

37
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,021
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested

38
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:43,163
correspond to the data transmitted.

39
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:46,060
Of course the question is:

40
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:50,244
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,

41
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:54,078
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?

42
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,145
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

43
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,416
We have shown in the lab

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,922
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second

45
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:06,381
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

46
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,548
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.

47
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:14,747
Now let me show you in practice.

48
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:21,483
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.

49
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,768
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;

50
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,975
it is connected to the laptop.

51
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,269
And also we have an instrument here

52
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:35,071
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.

53
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,893
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.

54
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:42,198
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.

55
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:45,942
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,

56
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,072
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

57
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,204
for a moment,

58
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:54,222
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.

59
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,594
So the solar cell, for a moment,

60
00:03:56,618 --> 00:04:00,140
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,818
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

62
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,025
I turn it on ...

63
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,768
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

64
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:13,909
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.

65
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,742
And I've done this
by pressing this button.

66
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:22,489
So now this LED lamp here
is streaming a video

67
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,645
by changing the brightness of the LED
in a very subtle way,

68
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,167
and in a way that you can't
recognize with your eye,

69
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:32,447
because the changes
are too fast to recognize.

70
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,783
But in order to prove the point,

71
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,952
I can block the light of the solar cell.

72
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:43,310
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops

73
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,026
and the video stops as well.

74
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,706
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.

75
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:55,586
(Applause)

76
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,943
And I can repeat that.

77
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:03,218
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.

78
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:07,650
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.

79
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,463
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.

80
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,409
And so I want to simulate fog,

81
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:19,176
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,632
(Laughter)

83
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:24,616
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.

84
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,533
First you notice

85
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:31,754
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

86
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:34,356
but now the video still continues.

87
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,388
This means, despite the blockage,

88
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:41,293
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,

89
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:46,832
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,

90
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:49,460
in this case, a high-definition video.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,603
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver

92
00:05:56,627 --> 00:06:00,442
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,

93
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:05,282
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.

94
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,291
That's why it is possible

95
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:12,172
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut

96
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,689
to act as a broadband receiver

97
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:19,089
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.

98
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:23,300
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.

99
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,825
And the same is true

100
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:28,642
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,

101
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,198
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,

102
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:36,765
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices

103
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,865
that will form the Internet of Things.

104
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,047
Because simply,

105
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,562
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,

106
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:45,561
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.

107
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,148
As I said to you,

108
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:50,490
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.

109
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,569
It's very much a lab demonstration,

110
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:53,796
a prototype.

111
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:57,570
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market

112
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,585
within the next two to three years.

113
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:05,544
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,

114
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:06,766
and also contribute

115
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,735
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,895
And all of this without causing

117
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,371
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --

118
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,617
because of the solar cells,
quite the opposite.

119
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,794
Thank you.

120
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:23,000
(Applause)
