00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,536
As a lover of human anatomy,

1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,576
I'm so excited that we're finally
putting our bodies at the center of focus.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,176
Through practices
such as preventive medicine,

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,656
patient empowerment

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,256
and self-monitoring --

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,816
down to now obsessing
over every single step we take in a day.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,456
All of this works to promote

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,240
a healthy connection
between ourselves and our bodies.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,016
Despite all this focus
on the healthy self,

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,880
general public knowledge
of the anatomical self is lacking.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,515
Many people don't know
the location of their vital organs,

11
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,296
or even how they function.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,776
And that's because human anatomy

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
is a difficult and time-intensive
subject to learn.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,840
How many of you here
made it through anatomy?

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,096
Wow, good --

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
most of you are in medicine.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,240
I, like you, spent countless hours
memorizing hundreds of structures.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,440
Something no student of anatomy
could do without the help of visuals.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,936
Because at the end of the day,

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,616
whether you remember
every little structure or not,

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,216
these medical illustrations are what
makes studying anatomy so intriguing.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,696
In looking at them,

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,960
we're actually viewing
a manual of our very selves.

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
But what happens when we're done studying?

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,976
These beautiful illustrations
are then shut back

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,976
into the pages of a medical textbook,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,216
or an app,

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,600
referenced only when needed.

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,656
And for the public,

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,536
medical illustrations
may only be encountered passively

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,200
on the walls of a doctor's office.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,416
From the beginnings of modern medicine,

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,736
medical illustration,

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,336
and therefore anatomy,

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,240
have existed primarily within
the realm of medical education.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,496
Yet there's something fascinating
happening right now.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,016
Artists are breaking anatomy
out of the confines of the medical world

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,240
and are thrusting it
into the public space.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,776
For the past nine years,
I have been cataloguing and sharing

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,296
this rise in anatomical art
with the public --

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
all from my perspective
as a medical illustrator.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,816
But before I get into showing you
how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,200
it's important to understand
how art influenced anatomy in the past.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,976
Now, anatomy is by its
very nature a visual science,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
and the first anatomists to understand
this lived during the Renaissance.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,336
They relied on artists

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
to help advertise their discoveries
to their peers in the public.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,200
And this drive to not only teach
but also to entertain

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,480
resulted in some of the strangest
anatomical illustrations.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,136
Anatomy was caught in a struggle
between science, art and culture

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,960
that lasted for over 500 years.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,856
Artists rendered
dissected cadavers as alive,

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,560
posed in these humorous
anatomical stripteases.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
Imagine seeing that
in your textbooks today.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
They also showed them as very much dead --

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
unwillingly stripped of their skin.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Disembodied limbs were often
posed in literal still lives.

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,656
And some illustrations
even included pop culture references.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,976
This is Clara,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,336
a famous rhinoceros that was
traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,376
at a time when seeing a rhino
was an exciting rarity.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,080
Including her in this illustration
was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
The introduction of color

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,136
then brought a whole new
depth and clarity to anatomy

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
that made it stunning.

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,776
By the early 20th century,

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,256
the perfect balance of science
and art had finally been struck

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,096
with the emergence
of medical illustrators.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,976
They created a universal
representation of anatomy --

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,856
something that was neither alive nor dead,

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
that was free from those influences
of artistic culture.

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,896
And this focus on no-frills accuracy

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,536
was precisely for the benefit
of medical education.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
And this is what we
get to study from today.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,896
But why is it that medical illustration --

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,495
both past and present --

77
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,079
captures our imaginations?

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,040
Now, we are innately tuned
into the beauty of the human body.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,960
And medical illustration is still art.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,856
Nothing can elicit
an emotional response --

81
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,456
from joy to complete disgust --

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
more than the human body.

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,616
And today,

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,016
artists armed with that emotion,

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,736
are grasping anatomy
from the medical world,

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,880
and are reinvigorating it through art
in the most imaginative ways.

87
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,016
A perfect example of this is Spanish
contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,200
He takes 19th century anatomical
illustrations of the male body

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,840
and envelops them in a female sensuality.

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,456
The women in his paintings taunt us
to view beyond their surface anatomy,

91
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,416
thereby introducing a strong femininity

92
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,320
that was previously lacking in the history
of anatomical representation.

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,216
Artistry can also be seen in the repair
and recovery of the human body.

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,376
This is an X-ray of a woman
who fractured and dislocated her ankle

95
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
in a roller-skating accident.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,696
As a tribute to her trauma,

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,416
she commissioned Montreal-based
architect Federico Carbajal

98
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,240
to construct a wire sculpture
of her damaged lower leg.

99
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Now, notice those bright red screws
magnified in the sculpture.

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,920
These are the actual surgical screws
used in reconstructing her ankle.

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,000
It's medical hardware
that's been repurposed as art.

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,456
People often ask me how I choose
the art that I showcase online

103
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,416
or feature in gallery shows.

104
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,096
And for me it's a balance
between the technique

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,856
and a concept that pushes the boundaries
of anatomy as a way to know thyself,

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,200
which is why the work
of Michael Reedy struck me.

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,576
His serious figure drawings
are often layered in elements of humor.

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,680
For instance, take a look at her face.

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
Notice those red marks.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,496
Michael manifests the consuming
insecurity of a skin condition

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,496
as these maniacal cartoon monsters

112
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,680
annoying and out of control
in the background.

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
On the mirrored figure,

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,776
he renders the full anatomy

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,936
and covers it in glitter,

116
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
making it look like candy.

117
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,856
By doing this,

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,256
Michael downplays
the common perception of anatomy

119
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760
so closely tied to just disease and death.

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,616
Now, this next concept
might not make much sense,

121
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,560
but human anatomy
is no longer limited to humans.

122
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,656
When you were a child,

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,136
did you ever wish
that your toys could come to life?

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,376
Well, Jason Freeny
makes those dreams come true

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,016
with his magical toy dissections.

126
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
(Laughter)

127
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,056
One might think that this
would bring a morbid edge

128
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,536
to one's innocent childhood characters,

129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,056
but Jason says of his dissections,

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,560
"One thing I've never seen
in a child's reaction to my work is fear."

131
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,176
It's always wonder,

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,576
amazement

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
and wanting to explore.

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,200
Fear of anatomy and guts
is a learned reaction.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,440
This anatomization also extends to
politically and socially charged objects.

136
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,456
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"

137
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,040
we see a gun dissected
to reveal human organs.

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,896
But if you look closely,

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,680
you'll notice that it lacks a brain.

140
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,136
And if you keep looking,
you might also notice

141
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,256
that Noah has so thoughtfully
placed the rectum

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,160
at the business end of that gun barrel.

143
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,856
Now, this next artist
I've been following for many years,

144
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,200
watching him excite
the public about anatomy.

145
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,216
Danny Quirk is a young artist

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,520
who paints his subjects
in the process of self-dissection.

147
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,616
He bends the rules of medical illustration

148
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,040
by inserting a very dramatic
light and shadow.

149
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,176
And this creates a 3-D illusion

150
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,320
that lends itself very well
to painting directly on the human skin.

151
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Danny makes it look as if a person's
skin has actually been removed.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,775
And this effect --

153
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,000
also cool and tattoo-like --

154
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,799
easily transitions
into a medical illustration.

155
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,296
Now Danny is currently
traveling the world,

156
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,336
teaching anatomy to the public
via his body paintings,

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,416
which is why it was
so shocking to find out

158
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,160
that he was rejected
from medical illustration programs.

159
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
But he's doing just fine.

160
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,736
Then there are artists

161
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,536
who are extracting anatomy from both
the medical world and the art world

162
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,640
and are placing it
directly on the streets.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,320
London-based SHOK-1 paints
giant X-rays of pop culture icons.

164
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,456
His X-rays show how culture
can come to have an anatomy of its own,

165
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,320
and conversely how culture can become
part of the anatomy of a person.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,336
You come to admire his work

167
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,416
because reproducing X-rays by hand,
let alone with spray paint,

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,496
is extremely difficult.

169
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,416
But then again this is a street artist,

170
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,920
who also happens to hold
a degree in applied chemistry.

171
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,616
Nychos, an Austrian street artist,

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,736
takes the term "exploded view"
to a whole new level,

173
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,440
splattering human and animal dissections
on walls all over the world.

174
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,296
Influenced by comics and heavy metal,

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,136
Nychos inserts a very youthful
and enticing energy into anatomy

176
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
that I just love.

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,776
Street artists believe
that art belongs to the public.

178
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,656
And this street anatomy is so captivating

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,400
because it is the furthest removed
from the medical world.

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,536
It forces you to look at it,

181
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
and confront your own
perceptions about anatomy,

182
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,656
whether you find it beautiful,

183
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,896
gross,

184
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,136
morbid

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
or awe-inspiring, like I do.

186
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,856
That it elicits these responses at all

187
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,440
is due to our intimate
and often changing relationship with it.

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,336
All of the artists
that I showed you here today

189
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,016
referenced medical
illustrations for their art.

190
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,256
But for them,

191
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,976
anatomy isn't just something to memorize,

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,160
but a base from which to understand
the human body on a meaningful level;

193
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,456
to depict it in ways that we can relate,

194
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,816
whether it be through cartoons,

195
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,056
body painting

196
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,280
or street art.

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,056
Anatomical art has the power

198
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,096
to reach far beyond
the pages of a medical textbook,

199
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,296
to ignite an excitement in the public,

200
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
and reinvigorate an enthusiasm
in the medical world,

201
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,680
ultimately connecting our innermost selves
with our bodies through art.

202
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,096
Thank you.

203
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
(Applause)
