0
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,504
The FBI is responsible
for more terrorism plots

1
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:17,175
in the United States

2
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,771
than any other organization.

3
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,625
More than al Qaeda,

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,010
more than al Shabaab,

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,560
more than the Islamic State,

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,354
more than all of them combined.

7
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:30,011
This isn't likely how you
think about the FBI.

8
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:34,066
You probably think of FBI agents
gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,

9
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:37,207
or arresting corrupt politicians.

10
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:38,858
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,

11
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,331
the FBI became less concerned

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,940
with gangsters and
crooked elected officials.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,402
The new target became terrorists,

14
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,823
and the pursuit of terrorists
has consumed the FBI.

15
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,618
Every year, the Bureau spends
3,3 billion dollars

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,222
on domestic counterterrorism activities.

17
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:57,823
Compare than to just 2,6 billion dollars
combined for organized crime,

18
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,999
financial fraud, public corruption

19
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,777
and all other types of traditional
criminal activity.

20
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,973
I've spent years pouring through
the case files

21
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,805
of terrorism prosecutions in
the United States,

22
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,074
and I've come to
the conclusion that the FBI

23
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:13,914
is much better at creating terrorists
than it is at catching terrorists.

24
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,097
In the 14 years since 9/11,

25
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:20,681
you can count about six real
terrorist attacks in the United States.

26
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,751
These include the Boston Marathon
bombings in 2013,

27
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,040
as well as failed attacks,

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,505
such as the time when
a man named Faisal Shahzad

29
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,077
tried to deliver a car bomb
to Times Square.

30
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,122
In those same 14 years,

31
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:33,754
the Bureau, however, has bragged

32
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:36,335
about how it's foiled dozens
of terrorism plots.

33
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:41,183
In all, the FBI has arrested
more than 175 people

34
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,629
in aggressive, undercover
conterterrorism stings.

35
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:47,467
These operations, which are usually
led by an informant,

36
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,293
provide the means and opportunity,

37
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,225
and sometimes even the idea,

38
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:54,081
for mentally ill and
economically desperate people

39
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,291
to become what we now term terrorists.

40
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,368
After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:

41
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,586
never again.

42
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:04,707
Never another attack on American soil.

43
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,667
FBI agents were told to find terrorists
before they struck.

44
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:12,507
To do this, agents recruited a network
of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,

45
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,276
all looking for anyone who
might be dangerous.

46
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,647
An informant can earn
100,000 dollars or more

47
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,752
for every terrorism case
they bring to the FBI.

48
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:24,025
That's right, the FBI is paying
mostly criminals and con men

49
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,926
six figures to spy on communities
in the United States,

50
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:30,103
but mostly Muslim American communities.

51
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,277
These informants nab people like
Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif

52
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,148
and Walli Mujahidh.

53
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:36,653
Both are mentally ill.

54
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:40,016
Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing
gasoline and attempting suicide.

55
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:42,537
Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,

56
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,745
he had trouble distinguishing between
reality and fantasy.

57
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,227
In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men

58
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:52,039
for conspiring to attack a military
recruiting station outside Seattle

59
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,363
with weapons provided,
of course, by the FBI.

60
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:59,068
The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,

61
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:01,027
a convicted rapist and child molester

62
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:04,361
who was paid 90,000 dollars
for his work on the case.

63
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,849
This isn't an outlier.

64
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,671
In 2009, an FBI informant
who had fled Pakistan on murder charges

65
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,995
led four men in a plot to bomb
synagogues in the Bronx.

66
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,526
The lead defendant was James Cromitie,

67
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:18,476
a broke Walmart employee
with a history of mental problems.

68
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:21,201
And the informant had offered
him 250,000 dollars

69
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,587
if he participated in that plot.

70
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:26,232
There are many more examples.

71
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:28,350
Today, The Intercept
published my new story

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,065
about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa
involving Sami Osmakac,

73
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:35,218
a young man who was living
near Tampa, Florida.

74
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,890
Osmakac also had
schizoaffective disorder.

75
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,895
He too was broke,

76
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,932
and he had no connections to
international terrorist groups.

77
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:42,773
Nonetheless,

78
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,617
an FBI informant gave him a job,
handed him money,

79
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,438
introduced him to an undercover agent
posing as a terrorist,

80
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,727
and lured him in a plot
to bomb an Irish bar.

81
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,684
But here's what's interesting:

82
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,138
The lead undercover agent --

83
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,776
you can see him in this picture
with his face blurred --

84
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:02,287
would go back to the Tampa field office
with his recording equipment on.

85
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:03,608
Behind closed doors,

86
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,987
FBI agents admitted that what
they were doing was farcical.

87
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:10,216
A federal judge doesn't want you
to hear about these conversations.

88
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,367
He sealed the transcripts and placed
them under a protective order

89
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,784
in an attempt to prevent someone like me
from doing something like this.

90
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:19,585
Behind closed doors, the lead agent,

91
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:20,916
the squad supervisor,

92
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,551
described their would-be terrorist

93
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:25,182
as a "retarded fool who didn't have
a pot to piss in."

94
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,009
They described his terrorist ambitions

95
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,998
as wishy-washy and
a pipe dream scenario.

96
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,756
But that didn't stop the FBI.

97
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:36,092
They provided Sami Osmakac
everything he needed.

98
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,804
They gave him a car bomb,
they gave him an AK-47,

99
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,386
they helped him make a so-called
martyrdom video,

100
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,480
and they even gave
him money for a taxi cab

101
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,944
so that he could get to where
they wanted him to go.

102
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,814
As they were working the sting,

103
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:53,327
the squad supervisor tells his agents
he wanted a Hollywood ending.

104
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,168
And he got a Hollywood ending.

105
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,609
When Sami Osmakac attempted
to deliver what he thought

106
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:00,905
was a car bomb,

107
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:04,584
he was arrested, convicted and
sentenced to 40 years in prison.

108
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,223
Sami Osmakac isn't alone.

109
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,825
He's one of more than
175 so-called terrorists,

110
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,803
for whom the FBI has created
Hollywood endings.

111
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,512
U.S. government officials call this
the War on Terror.

112
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,759
It's really just theater,

113
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,089
a national security theater,

114
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,574
with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac

115
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,621
unwitting actors in a
carefully choreographed production

116
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,829
brought to you by the FBI.

117
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,956
Thank you.

118
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,870
(Applause)

119
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,421
Tom Rielly: So, those are some
pretty strong accusations,

120
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,938
pretty strong charges.

121
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,711
How can you back this up?

122
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,727
Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010

123
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:53,795
when I received a grant from the
Investigative Reporting Program

124
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:54,730
at U.C. Berkeley,

125
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,162
and a research assistant and I

126
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,635
put together a database
of all terrorism prosecutions

127
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:01,638
at the time during
the first decade after 9/11.

128
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,458
And we used the court file
to find out whether

129
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,881
the defendants had any connections
to international terrorist groups,

130
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,364
whether an informant was used,

131
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:12,506
and whether the informant
played the role of an agent provocateur

132
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,373
by providing the means and opportunity.

133
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,950
And we submitted that to the FBI

134
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,064
and we asked them to respond
to our database.

135
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,021
If they believed there were any errors,

136
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:23,154
we asked them to tell us what they were
and we'd go back and check

137
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:25,382
and they never challenged any
of our findings.

138
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:27,580
Later, I used that data
in a magazine article

139
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,629
and later in my book,

140
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,176
and on appearances on places
like CBS and NPR,

141
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,083
they were offered that opportunity again

142
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,333
to say, "Trevor Aaronson's
findings are wrong."

143
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,193
And they've never
come forward and said,

144
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:39,314
"These are the problems
with those findings."

145
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:42,455
So the data has since been used
by groups like Human Rights Watch

146
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,157
on its recent report on
these types of sting operations.

147
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:47,796
And so far, the FBI has never
really responded

148
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:51,022
to these charges that it's really
not catching terrorists

149
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,167
so much as it's catching
mentally ill people

150
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,529
that it can dress up as terrorists
in these types of sting operations.

151
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:01,327
TR: So The Intercept is that new
investigative journalism website,

152
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:03,095
that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.

153
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,674
Tell us about your article
and why there.

154
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,654
TA: The Intercept seemed to be
the most logical place for this

155
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:12,723
because my article is
really leveraging the fact that

156
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,208
a source had leaked to me
transcripts of these

157
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,155
private FBI conversations
that a federal judge had sealed

158
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,556
based on the government's claim
that their release

159
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,748
would irreparably damage
the U.S. government's

160
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,852
law enforcement strategy.

161
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,831
So a place like The Intercept
was set up to protect journalists

162
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:28,890
and publish their work

163
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,719
when they're dealing with
very sensitive matters like this.

164
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,618
So my story in The Intercept,
which was just published today,

165
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,953
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac
was set up in this FBI sting

166
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:39,633
and goes into much greater detail.

167
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,597
In this talk, I could only
highlight the things that they said,

168
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,434
such as calling him a "retarded fool."

169
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,916
But it was much more elaborate,

170
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,012
they went to great lengths
to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,

171
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,068
which he then used to purchase weapons
from the undercover agent.

172
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:53,208
When he went to trial,

173
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,339
the central piece of evidence
was that he paid for these weapons,

174
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,260
when in truth, these transcripts show
how the FBI orchestrated

175
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,660
someone who was essentially
mentally ill and broke

176
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,879
to get money to then
pay for weapons

177
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,387
that they could then charge him
in a conspiracy for.

178
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,514
TR: One final question.

179
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:10,035
Less than 10 days ago,

180
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:13,187
the FBI arrested some potential
ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,

181
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,715
saying that they might
be headed to Syria,

182
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,622
and were those real,
or examples of more of the same?

183
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,636
TA: Well so far, we only know
what's come out in the court file,

184
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,641
but they seem to suggest it's another
example of the same.

185
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,823
These types of sting operations
have moved from flavor to flavor.

186
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:30,991
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,

187
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,305
and now the Islamic State
is the current flavor.

188
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,874
What's worth noting about that case
is that the three men that were charged

189
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,724
only began the plot to go to Syria

190
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,801
after the introduction
of the FBI informant,

191
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,251
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
them with the travel documents

192
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,167
that they needed.

193
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,784
In kind of a comical turn
in that particular case,

194
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,850
one of the defendant's mother
had found out

195
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,016
that he was interested in going to Syria
and had hid his passport.

196
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,949
So it's unclear that even if he had
showed up at the airport,

197
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,777
that he ever could have gone anywhere.

198
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:01,420
So yes, there are people who might
be interested in joining the Islamic State

199
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,428
in the United States,

200
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:06,050
and those are people that the United
States government should be looking at

201
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,329
to see if they're interested
in violence here.

202
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,509
In this particular case, given
the evidence that's so far come out,

203
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,904
it suggests the FBI made
it possible for these guys

204
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,984
to move along in a plan to go to Syria

205
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,582
when they were never close
to that in the first place.

206
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,825
TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing.
TA: Thank you.

207
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:21,616
(Applause)
