00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,096
The word concussion evokes a fear
these days more so than it ever has,

1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,496
and I know this personally.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,176
I played 10 years of football,

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,616
was struck in the head thousands of times.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,296
And I have to tell you, though,
what was much worse than that

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,096
was a pair of bike accidents I had
where I suffered concussions,

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,056
and I'm still dealing with the effects
of the most recent one

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,840
today as I stand in front of you.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,096
There is a fear around concussion

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,080
that does have some evidence behind it.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,936
There is information
that a repeated history of concussion

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,256
can lead to early dementia,
such as Alzheimer's,

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,336
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,400
That was the subject
of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,136
And so everybody is caught up in football
and what they see in the military,

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,496
but you may not know

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,816
that bike riding is the leading cause
of concussion for kids,

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,507
sports-related concussion, that is.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,616
And so another thing
that I should tell you

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,856
that you may not know

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,816
is that the helmets that are worn
in bicycling and football

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,496
and many activities,

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,096
they're not designed or tested

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,600
for how well they can protect
your children against concussion.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,936
They're in fact designed and tested

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,640
for their ability to protect
against skull fracture.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,456
And so I get this question
all the time from parents,

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,056
and they ask me,

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,376
"Would you let your own child
play football?"

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,576
Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,496
And I think that as a field,

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
we're a long way from giving an answer
with any kind of confidence there.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,016
So I look at that question
from a bit of a different lens,

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,776
and I want to know,
how can we prevent concussion?

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,456
Is that even possible?

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,040
And most experts think that it's not,

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,736
but the work that we're doing in my lab

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,136
is starting to reveal more
of the details around concussion

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,936
so that we can have
a better understanding.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,816
The reason we're able
to prevent skull fracture with helmets

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,295
is because it's pretty simple.
We know how it works.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,360
Concussion has been
much more of a mystery.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,040
So to give you a sense of what might
be happening in a concussion,

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,176
I want to show you the video here

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,736
that you see when you type into Google,

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,176
"What is a concussion?"

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,856
The CDC website comes up,

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,336
and this video essentially
tells the whole story.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,776
What you see is the head moves forward,

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,856
the brain lags behind,

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,296
then the brain catches up

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,576
and smashes into the skull.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,776
It rebounds off the skull

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
and then proceeds to run
into the other side of the skull.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,936
And what you'll notice is highlighted
in this video from the CDC,

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,416
which I'll note was funded by the NFL,

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,376
is that the outer surface of the brain,

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,696
where it was to have
smashed into the skull,

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,656
looks like it's been damaged or injured,
so it's on the outer surface of the brain.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,656
And what I'd like to do with this video

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,376
is to tell you that there are
some aspects that are probably right,

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,416
indicative of what the scientists
think happens with concussion,

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,056
but there's probably more
that's wrong with this video.

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,336
So one thing that I do agree with,
and I think most experts would,

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,376
is that the brain
does have these dynamics.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,776
It does lag behind the skull

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,456
and then catch up and move
back and forth and oscillate.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,720
That we think is true.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,056
However, the amount of motion
you see in the brain in this video

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,656
is probably not right at all.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,096
There's very little room
in the cranial vault,

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,816
only a few millimeters,

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,016
and it's filled entirely
with cerebral spinal fluid,

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,216
which acts as a protective layer.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,400
And so the brain as a whole probably
moves very little inside the skull.

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,576
The other problem with this video

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,336
is that the brain is shown

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,456
as a kind of rigid whole
as it moves around,

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
and that's not true either.

79
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,136
Your brain is one of the softest
substances in your body,

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,176
and you can think of it
kind of like jello.

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,336
So as your head is moving back and forth,

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,216
your brain is twisting
and turning and contorting,

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,456
and the tissue is getting stretched.

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,496
And so most experts, I think, would agree

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,656
that concussion is not likely
to be something that's happening

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,496
on this outer surface of the brain,

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,616
but rather it's something
that's much deeper

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,200
towards the center of the brain.

89
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,856
Now, the way that we're
approaching this problem

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,216
to try to understand
the mechanisms of concussion

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,096
and to figure out if we can prevent it

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,936
is we are using a device like this.

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
It's a mouthguard.

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,856
It has sensors in it
that are essentially the same

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,216
that are in your cell phone:

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,576
accelerometers, gyroscopes,

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,496
and when someone is struck in the head,

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,056
it can tell you how their head moved

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,200
at a thousand samples per second.

100
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,456
The principle behind
the mouthguard is this:

101
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,736
it fits onto your teeth.

102
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,816
Your teeth are one of the hardest
substances in your body.

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,896
So it rigidly couples to your skull

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,336
and gives you the most precise
possible measurement

105
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,296
of how the skull moves.

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,856
People have tried
other approaches, with helmets.

107
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,256
We've looked at other sensors
that go on your skin,

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,896
and they all simply move around too much,

109
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,616
and so we found that this
is the only reliable way

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
to take a good measurement.

111
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,696
So now that we've got this device,
we can go beyond studying cadavers,

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,136
because you can only
learn so much about concussion

113
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,376
from studying a cadaver,

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,176
and we want to learn
and study live humans.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,096
So where can we find
a group of willing volunteers

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,376
to go out and smash their heads
into each other on a regular basis

117
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,616
and sustain concussion?

118
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,536
Well, I was one of them,

119
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,360
and it's your local friendly
Stanford football team.

120
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,256
So this is our laboratory,

121
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,976
and I want to show you

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,176
the first concussion
we measured with this device.

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,456
One of the things that I should point out
is the device has this gyroscope in it,

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,216
and that allows you
to measure the rotation of the head.

125
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,616
Most experts think
that that's the critical factor

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,496
that might start to tell us
what is happening in concussion.

127
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,880
So please watch this video.

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,696
Announcer: Cougars bring
extra people late, but Luck has time,

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,360
and Winslow is crushed.

130
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,696
I hope he's all right.

131
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,680
(Audience roars)

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,016
Top of your screen,

133
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,456
you'll see him come on
just this little post route,

134
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,120
get separation, safety.

135
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Here it comes at you in real speed.
You'll hear this.

136
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,520
The hit delivered by --

137
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,176
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times
is probably a little excessive there.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,456
But you get the idea.

139
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,296
So when you look at just the film here,

140
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,136
pretty much the only thing you can see
is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.

141
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,816
But when we extract the data

142
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,

143
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:05,576
we can see much more detail,
much richer information.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,016
And one of the things that we noticed here

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,096
is that he was struck
in the lower left side of his face mask.

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,296
And so that did something first
that was a little counterintuitive.

147
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,016
His head did not move to the right.

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,976
In fact, it rotated first to the left.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,856
Then as the neck began to compress,

150
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,976
the force of the blow caused it
to whip back to the right.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,856
So this left-right motion
was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,

152
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,296
and we think that is probably
what led to the brain injury.

153
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,096
Now, this device is only limited in such
that it can measure the skull motion,

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,536
but what we really want to know
is what's happening inside of the brain.

155
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,056
So we collaborate with
Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,656
They've developed a finite element
model of the brain.

157
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,776
And so this is a simulation

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,136
using the data from our mouthguard
from the injury I just showed you,

159
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,176
and what you see is the brain --

160
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,616
this is a cross-section right in the front

161
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,416
of the brain twisting
and contorting as I mentioned.

162
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,336
So you can see this doesn't
look a lot like the CDC video.

163
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,216
Now, the colors that you're looking at

164
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,376
are how much the brain tissue
is being stretched.

165
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,096
And so the red is 50 percent.

166
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,776
That means the brain has been stretched
to 50 percent of its original length,

167
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,496
the tissue in that particular area.

168
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,776
And the main thing I want to draw
your attention to is this red spot.

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,256
So the red spot is very close
to the center of the brain,

170
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,536
and relatively speaking,

171
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,216
you don't see a lot of colors like that
on the exterior surface

172
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,600
as the CDC video showed.

173
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,696
Now, to explain a little more detail

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,336
about how we think
concussion might be happening,

175
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,656
one thing I should mention

176
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,895
is that we and others have observed
that a concussion is more likely

177
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,895
when you're struck and your head
rotates in this direction.

178
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,176
This is more common
in sports like football,

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,535
but this seems to be more dangerous.
So what might be happening there?

180
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,576
Well, one thing that you'll notice
in the human brain

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,336
that is different than other animals

182
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,816
is we have these two very large lobes.

183
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,056
We have the right brain
and the left brain.

184
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,136
And the key thing
to notice in this figure here

185
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,416
is that right down the center
of the right brain and the left brain

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,376
there's a large fissure
that goes deep into the brain.

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,256
And in that fissure,
what you can't see in this image,

188
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,496
you'll have to trust me,

189
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,216
there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,456
It's called the falx,

191
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,136
and it runs from the front of your head
all the way to the back of your head,

192
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,376
and it's quite stiff.

193
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,856
And so what that allows for
is when you're struck

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,936
and your head rotates
in this left-right direction,

195
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,736
forces can rapidly transmit
right down to the center of your brain.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
Now, what's there
at the bottom of this fissure?

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,616
It's the wiring of your brain,

198
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,256
and in fact this red bundle
here at the bottom of that fissure

199
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,256
is the single largest fiber bundle

200
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,256
that is the wiring that connects
the right and left sides of your brain.

201
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,804
It's called the corpus callosum.

202
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,416
And we think that this might be

203
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,256
one of the most common
mechanisms of concussion,

204
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,976
and as the forces move down,
they strike the corpus callosum,

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,976
it causes a dissociation
between your right and your left brain

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,480
and could explain some
of the symptoms of concussion.

207
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,496
This finding is also consistent
of what we've seen

208
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,536
in this brain disease that I mentioned,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

209
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,096
So this is an image of a middle-aged
ex-professional football player,

210
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,096
and the thing that I want to point out
is if you look at the corpus callosum,

211
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,056
and I'll page back here so you can see
the size of a normal corpus callosum

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,496
and the size of the person here
who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

213
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,056
it is greatly atrophied.

214
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,416
And the same goes
for all of the space in the ventricles.

215
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,216
These ventricles are much larger.

216
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,776
And so all of this tissue
near the center of the brain

217
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,016
has died off over time.

218
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,600
So what we're learning
is indeed consistent.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,176
Now, there is some good news here,

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,656
and I hope to give you a sense
of hope by the end of this talk.

221
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,776
One of the things that we've noticed,

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,056
specifically about
this mechanism of injury,

223
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,136
is although there's a rapid transmission
of the forces down this fissure,

224
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,456
it still takes a defined amount of time.

225
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,816
And what we think is that if we can
slow the head down just enough

226
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,056
so that the brain
does not lag behind the skull

227
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,656
but instead it moves
in synchrony with the skull,

228
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,936
then we might be able to prevent
this mechanism of concussion.

229
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,640
So how can we slow the head down?

230
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,376
(Laughter)

231
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
A gigantic helmet.

232
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,296
So with more space, you have more time,

233
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,416
and this is a bit of a joke,
but some of you may have seen this.

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,736
This is bubble soccer,
and it's a real sport.

235
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,416
In fact, I saw some young adults

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,416
playing this sport down the street
from my house the other day,

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,336
and as far as I know
there have been no reported concussions.

238
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,376
(Laughter)

239
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,816
But in all seriousness,
this principle does work,

240
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,216
but this has gone too far.

241
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,496
This isn't something that's practical
for bike riding or playing football.

242
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,896
And so we are collaborating
with a company in Sweden called Hövding.

243
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,256
Some of you may have seen their work,

244
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,656
and they're using the same principle
of air to give you some extra space

245
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
to prevent concussion.

246
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,080
Kids, don't try this at home please.

247
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,840
This stuntman does not have a helmet.

248
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,456
He instead has a neck collar,

249
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,056
and this neck collar has sensors in it,

250
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,656
the same type of sensors
that are in our mouthguard,

251
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,816
and it detects when he's likely
to have a fall,

252
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,176
and there's an airbag
that explodes and triggers,

253
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,976
the same way that an airbag
works in your car, essentially.

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,936
And in the experiments
we've done in my lab with their device,

255
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,696
we found that it can greatly reduce
the risk of concussion in some scenarios

256
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,856
compared to a normal bicycle helmet.

257
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
So it's a pretty exciting development.

258
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,416
But in order for us to actually realize
the benefits of technology

259
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,296
that can prevent concussion,

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,256
it needs to meet regulations.

261
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,976
That's a reality.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,136
And this device is for sale in Europe

263
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,856
but is not for sale in the US,
and probably won't be any time soon.

264
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,416
So I wanted to tell you why.

265
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,216
There are some good reasons and then
there are some not so good reasons.

266
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,456
Bike helmets are federally regulated.

267
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,216
The Consumer Product Safety Commission
has been given jurisdiction

268
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,096
to approve any bike helmet for sale,

269
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,576
and this is the test they use.

270
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,256
This is back to what I was telling you
at the beginning about skull fracture.

271
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,696
That's what this test is for.

272
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,456
And that's an important thing to do.

273
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,336
It can save your life,
but it's not sufficient, I would say.

274
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,096
So for example, one thing
this test doesn't evaluate

275
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,936
is it doesn't tell you
is that airbag going to trigger

276
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,856
at the right time and place,
and not trigger when it doesn't need to?

277
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,936
Similarly, it's not going to tell you

278
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,336
is this helmet likely
to prevent concussion or not?

279
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,096
And if you look at football helmets,
which aren't regulated,

280
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,496
they still have a very similar test.

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,776
They're not regulated
by the government, anyway.

282
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,936
They have an industry body,
which is the way most industries work.

283
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,976
But this industry body, I can tell you,
has been quite resistant

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,376
to updating their standards.

285
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,656
So in my lab, we are working on not only
the mechanism of concussion,

286
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,136
but we want to understand
how can we have better test standards?

287
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,696
And we hope that the government
can use this type of information

288
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,456
to encourage innovation

289
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,096
by letting consumers know

290
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,896
how protected are you with a given helmet.

291
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,296
And I want to bring this back finally
to the original question I asked,

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,656
which is, would I feel comfortable
letting my child play football

293
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,416
or ride a bicycle?

294
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,776
And this might be just a result
of my own traumatic experience.

295
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm much more nervous
about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.

296
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,576
So she's a year and a half old,

297
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,056
and she's already, well, wants to anyway,
race down the streets of San Francisco.

298
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,416
This is the bottom
of one of these streets.

299
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,656
And so my personal goal
is to -- and I believe this is possible --

300
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,736
is to further develop these technologies,

301
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,736
and in fact, we're working
on something in my lab in particular

302
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,713
that really makes optimal use
of the given space of a helmet.

303
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,216
And I am confident
that we will be able to,

304
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,456
before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,

305
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,856
have something available

306
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,216
that can in fact really reduce
the risk of concussion

307
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,376
and comply with regulatory bodies.

308
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,016
And so what I'd like to do --

309
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,416
and I know that this is for some of you
of more immediate nature,

310
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,096
I've got a couple years here --

311
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,256
is to be able to tell parents
and grandparents when I'm asked,

312
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,696
it is safe and healthy for your children
to engage in these activities.

313
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,536
And I'm very fortunate
to have a wonderful team at Stanford

314
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,456
that's working hard on this.

315
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,576
So I hope to come back in a few years
with the final story,

316
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,576
but for now I will tell you,

317
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,536
please don't just be afraid
when you hear the word concussion.

318
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,776
There is hope.

319
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,016
Thank you.

320
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,543
(Applause)
