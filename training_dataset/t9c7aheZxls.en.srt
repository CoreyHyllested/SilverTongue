0
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,376
Strap yourselves in,

1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,376
we're going to Mars.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,496
Not just a few astronauts --

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,656
thousands of people
are going to colonize Mars.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,800
And I am telling you
that they're going to do this soon.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,536
Some of you will end up
working on projects on Mars,

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,920
and I guarantee that some
of your children will end up living there.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,136
That probably sounds preposterous,

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,040
so I'm going to share with you
how and when that will happen.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,976
But first I want to discuss
the obvious question:

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,479
Why the heck should we do this?

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,856
12 years ago,

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,696
I gave a TED talk on 10 ways
the world could end suddenly.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,496
We are incredibly vulnerable
to the whims of our own galaxy.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,096
A single, large asteroid
could take us out forever.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,576
To survive we have to reach
beyond the home planet.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,816
Think what a tragedy it would be

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,840
if all that humans have accomplished
were suddenly obliterated.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,736
And there's another reason we should go:

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,696
exploration is in our DNA.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,176
Two million years ago
humans evolved in Africa

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,016
and then slowly but surely
spread out across the entire planet

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,536
by reaching into the wilderness
that was beyond their horizons.

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,160
This stuff is inside us.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
And they prospered doing that.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,136
Some of the greatest advances
in civilization and technology

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,080
came because we explored.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,536
Yes, we could do a lot of good

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,280
with the money it will take
to establish a thriving colony on Mars.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,440
And yes we should all be taking
far better care of our own home planet.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,080
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars
the way we've screwed up Earth.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,936
But think for a moment,

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,896
what we had when John F. Kennedy
told us we would put a human on the moon.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,320
He excited an entire generation to dream.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,336
Think how inspired we will be
to see a landing on Mars.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,096
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,496
and see that that is
one people instead of many

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,056
and perhaps then
we will look back at Earth,

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,496
as we struggle to survive on Mars,

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,240
and realize how precious
the home planet is.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,440
So let me tell you about the extraordinary
adventure we're about to undertake.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,296
But first,

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
a few fascinating facts
about where we're going.

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,416
This picture actually represents
the true size of Mars compared to Earth.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,336
Mars is not our sister planet.

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,136
It's far less than half
the size of the Earth,

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,176
and yet despite the fact
that it's smaller,

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,896
the surface area of Mars
that you can stand on

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,856
is equivalent to the surface area
of the Earth that you can stand on,

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,200
because the Earth
is mostly covered by water.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,296
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,896
100 times thinner than on Earth --

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,920
and it's not breathable,
it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,376
It's really cold there.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,376
The average temperature
is minus 81 degrees,

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,560
although there is
quite a range of temperature.

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,896
A day on Mars is about as long
as a day on Earth,

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
plus about 39 minutes.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,480
Seasons and years on Mars
are twice as long as they are on Earth.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,656
And for anybody who wants to strap
on some wings and go flying one day,

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,496
Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,

61
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,776
and it's the kind of place

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
where you can jump over your car
instead of walk around it.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,776
Now, as you can see,
Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,560
but it's by far the most livable
other place in our entire solar system.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,856
Here's the problem.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,056
Mars is a long way away,

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,920
a thousand times farther away
from us than our own moon.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,336
The Moon is 250,000 miles away

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,000
and it took Apollo astronauts
three days to get there.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,856
Mars is 250 million miles away

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,136
and it will take us
eight months to get there --

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
240 days.

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,656
And that's only if we launch
on a very specific day,

74
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,416
at a very specific time,

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,416
once every two years,

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,616
when Mars and the Earth
are aligned just so,

77
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,560
so the distance that the rocket
would have to travel will be the shortest.

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,720
240 days is a long time to spend
trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,856
And meanwhile, our track record
of getting to Mars is lousy.

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,696
We and the Russians,
the Europeans, the Japanese,

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,056
the Chinese and the Indians,

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,656
have actually sent 44 rockets there,

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,216
and the vast majority of them
have either missed or crashed.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Only about a third of the missions
to Mars have been successful.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,120
And we don't at the moment have
a rocket big enough to get there anyway.

86
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,176
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,816
A couple of Saturn Vs
would have gotten us there.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,296
It was the most magnificent
machine ever built by humans,

89
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,520
and it was the rocket
that took us to the Moon.

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,136
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973
to launch the Skylab space station,

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,256
and we decided to do
something called the shuttle

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,920
instead of continuing on to Mars
after we landed on the Moon.

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,136
The biggest rocket we have now

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
is only half big enough
to get us anything to Mars.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,216
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,400
and that brings up
a really interesting question ...

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,760
how soon will the first humans
actually land here?

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,496
Now, some pundits think
if we got there by 2050,

99
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,240
that'd be a pretty good achievement.

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,720
These days, NASA seems to be saying
that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.

101
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
Maybe they can.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,696
I believe that they can get
human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,976
But frankly,

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,736
I don't think they're going to bother
in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,

105
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,736
because we will already be there.

106
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,720
We're going to land on Mars in 2027.

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,496
And the reason is

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,576
this man is determined
to make that happen.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,080
His name is Elon Musk,
he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,976
Now, he actually told me
that we would land on Mars by 2025,

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,896
but Elon Musk is more
optimistic than I am --

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,416
and that's going a ways --

113
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,080
so I'm giving him
a couple of years of slack.

114
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,376
Still ...

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,736
you've got to ask yourself,

116
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,640
can this guy really do this
by 2025 or 2027?

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk
into a little perspective.

118
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
Where was this 10 years ago?

119
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,616
That's the Tesla electric automobile.

120
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,296
In 2005, a lot of people
in the automobile industry were saying,

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,760
we would not have
a decent electric car for 50 years.

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
And where was that?

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,296
That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,696
lifting six tons of supplies
to the International Space Station.

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,936
10 years ago,

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,520
SpaceX had not launched anything,
or fired a rocket to anywhere.

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,136
So I think it's a pretty good bet

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,216
that the person who is revolutionizing
the automobile industry

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,456
in less than 10 years

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,296
and the person who created an entire
rocket company in less than 10 years

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,560
will get us to Mars by 2027.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,736
Now, you need to know this:

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,400
governments and robots
no longer control this game.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,416
Private companies are leaping into space

135
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,880
and they will be happy
to take you to Mars.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,760
And that raises a really big question.

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Can we actually live there?

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,856
Now, NASA may not be able
to get us there until 2040,

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,976
or we may get there
a long time before NASA,

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,960
but NASA has taken a huge responsibility
in figuring out how we can live on Mars.

141
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,896
Let's look at the problem this way.

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,776
Here's what you need to live on Earth:

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,216
food, water, shelter and clothing.

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,736
And here's what you need to live on Mars:

145
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,960
all of the above, plus oxygen.

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,256
So let's look at the most
important thing on this list first.

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,296
Water is the basis
of all life as we know it,

148
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,896
and it's far too heavy for us to carry
water from the Earth to Mars to live,

149
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,560
so we have to find water
if our life is going to succeed on Mars.

150
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,336
And if you look at Mars,
it looks really dry,

151
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,176
it looks like the entire
planet is a desert.

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,216
But it turns out that it's not.

153
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,456
The soil alone on Mars
contains up to 60 percent water.

154
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,416
And a number of orbiters that we still
have flying around Mars have shown us --

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,976
and by the way,
that's a real photograph --

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,136
that lots of craters on Mars
have a sheet of water ice in them.

157
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,360
It's not a bad place to start a colony.

158
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:08,016
Now, here's a view of a little dig
the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,

159
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,576
showing that just below
the surface of the soil is ice --

160
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,856
that white stuff is ice.

161
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,136
In the second picture,

162
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,416
which is four days later
than the first picture,

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,480
you can see that
some of it is evaporating.

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,416
Orbiters also tell us

165
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,856
that there are huge amounts
of underground water on Mars

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,936
as well as glaciers.

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,216
In fact, if only the water ice
at the poles on Mars melted,

168
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,000
most of the planet
would be under 30 feet of water.

169
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,056
So there's plenty of water there,

170
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,616
but most of it's ice,
most of it's underground,

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,000
it takes a lot of energy to get it
and a lot of human labor.

172
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,776
This is a device cooked up
at the University of Washington

173
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,280
back in 1998.

174
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,896
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.

175
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,976
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere
is often 100 percent humid.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,376
So this device can extract
all the water that humans will need

177
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
simply from the atmosphere on Mars.

178
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,136
Next we have to worry
about what we will breathe.

179
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,056
Frankly, I was really shocked

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,640
to find out that NASA
has this problem worked out.

181
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,240
This is a scientist at MIT
named Michael Hecht.

182
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,616
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.

183
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,856
I love this thing.

184
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,456
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,640
that sucks in the Martian atmosphere
and pumps out oxygen.

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,256
And you have to remember that CO2 --

187
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,136
carbon dioxide, which is
96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --

188
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,960
CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.

189
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,256
Now, the next big rover
that NASA sends to Mars in 2020

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,496
is going to have one
of these devices aboard,

191
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,216
and it will be able
to produce enough oxygen

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,936
to keep one person alive indefinitely.

193
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,096
But the secret to this --

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,816
and that's just for testing --

195
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,136
the secret to this is that this thing
was designed from the get-go

196
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,800
to be scalable by a factor of 100.

197
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,056
Next, what will we eat?

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,016
Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,

199
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,896
but we're not going to be able to grow

200
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,056
more than 15 to 20 percent
of our food there,

201
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,576
at least not until water is running
on the surface of Mars

202
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
and we actually have the probability
and the capability of planting crops.

203
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,936
In the meantime,

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,056
most of our food will arrive from Earth,

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,280
and it will be dried.

206
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
And then we need some shelter.

207
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,736
At first we can use inflatable,
pressurized buildings

208
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,016
as well as the landers themselves.

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,016
But this really only works
during the daytime.

210
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,136
There is too much solar radiation
and too much radiation from cosmic rays.

211
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,336
So we really have to go underground.

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,056
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,056
by and large,
is perfect for making bricks.

214
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,296
And NASA has figured this one out, too.

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,176
They're going to throw
some polymer plastic into the bricks,

216
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,976
shove them in a microwave oven,

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,256
and then you will be able to build
buildings with really thick walls.

218
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,256
Or we may choose to live underground
in caves or in lava tubes,

219
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,560
of which there are plenty.

220
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,560
And finally there's clothing.

221
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,336
On Earth we have miles
of atmosphere piled up on us,

222
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,656
which creates 15 pounds of pressure
on our bodies at all times,

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,823
and we're constantly
pushing out against that.

224
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,767
On Mars there's hardly
any atmospheric pressure.

225
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,616
So Dava Newman,

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,096
a scientist at MIT,

227
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,176
has created this sleek space suit.

228
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,696
It will keep us together,

229
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,960
block radiation and keep us warm.

230
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,056
So let's think about this for a minute.

231
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
we can do this.

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
We really can.

234
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,840
But it's still a little complicated
and a little difficult.

235
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,616
So that leads to the next big --

236
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,216
really big step --

237
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,056
in living the good life on Mars.

238
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,880
And that's terraforming the planet:

239
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,456
making it more like Earth,

240
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,320
reengineering an entire planet.

241
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,016
That sounds like a lot of hubris,

242
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,256
but the truth is

243
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,160
that the technology to do everything
I'm about to tell you already exists.

244
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,920
First we've got to warm it up.

245
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,096
Mars is incredibly cold
because it has a very thin atmosphere.

246
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,456
The answer lies here, at the south pole
and at the north pole of Mars,

247
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,736
both of which are covered

248
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,936
with an incredible amount
of frozen carbon dioxide --

249
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,416
dry ice.

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,776
If we heat it up,

251
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,376
it sublimes directly into the atmosphere

252
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,216
and thickens the atmosphere
the same way it does on Earth.

253
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,456
And as we know,

254
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,120
CO2 is an incredibly
potent greenhouse gas.

255
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,776
Now, my favorite way of doing this
is to erect a very, very large solar sail

256
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,016
and focus it --

257
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,776
it essentially serves as a mirror --

258
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,176
and focus it on the south pole
of Mars at first.

259
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,216
As the planet spins, it will heat up
all that dry ice, sublime it,

260
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,496
and it will go into the atmosphere.

261
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,016
It actually won't take long

262
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,296
for the temperature
on Mars to start rising,

263
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,880
probably less than 20 years.

264
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,776
Right now,

265
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,776
on a perfect day at the equator,

266
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,896
in the middle of summer on Mars,

267
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,376
temperatures can
actually reach 70 degrees,

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,816
but then they go down
to minus 100 at night.

269
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,416
(Laughter)

270
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,080
What we're shooting for
is a runaway greenhouse effect:

271
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,616
enough temperature rise
to see a lot of that ice on Mars --

272
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,080
especially the ice in the ground -- melt.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
Then we get some real magic.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,176
As the atmosphere gets thicker,
everything gets better.

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,816
We get more protection from radiation,

276
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,936
more atmosphere makes us warmer,
makes the planet warmer,

277
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,656
so we get running water

278
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,280
and that makes crops possible.

279
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,896
Then more water vapor goes into the air,
forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.

280
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
It will rain and it will snow on Mars.

281
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,416
And a thicker atmosphere
will create enough pressure

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,976
so that we can
throw away those space suits.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,376
We only need about five pounds
of pressure to survive.

284
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,680
Eventually, Mars will be made
to feel a lot like British Columbia.

285
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,376
We'll still be left
with the complicated problem

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,136
of making the atmosphere breathable,

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
and frankly that could take
1,000 years to accomplish.

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,936
But humans are amazingly smart
and incredibly adaptable.

289
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,936
There is no telling what our future
technology will be able to accomplish

290
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,730
and no telling what we can do
with our own bodies.

291
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,256
In biology right now,

292
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,496
we are on the very verge of being
able to control our own genetics,

293
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,056
what the genes
in our own bodies are doing,

294
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,216
and certainly,

295
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
eventually, our own evolution.

296
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,536
We could end up with a species
of human being on Earth

297
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,600
that is slightly different
from the species of human beings on Mars.

298
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,536
But what would you do there?
How would you live?

299
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,000
It's going to be
the same as it is on Earth.

300
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,816
Somebody's going to start a restaurant,

301
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
somebody's going to build an iron foundry.

302
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,056
Someone will make
documentary movies of Mars

303
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,480
and sell them on Earth.

304
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,576
Some idiot will start a reality TV show.

305
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
(Laughter)

306
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,936
There will be software companies,

307
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,360
there will be hotels, there will be bars.

308
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,176
This much is certain:

309
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,416
it will be the most disruptive
event in our lifetimes,

310
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,800
and I think it will be the most inspiring.

311
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,856
Ask any 10-year-old girl
if she wants to go to Mars.

312
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,200
Children who are now in elementary school
are going to choose to live there.

313
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Remember when we landed
humans on the Moon?

314
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,096
When that happened,
people looked at each other and said,

315
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,800
"If we can do this, we can do anything."

316
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,880
What are they going to think
when we actually form a colony on Mars?

317
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,296
Most importantly,

318
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,696
it will make us a spacefaring species.

319
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,176
And that means humans will survive
no matter what happens on Earth.

320
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,296
We will never be the last of our kind.

321
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,536
Thank you.

322
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,140
(Applause)
