0
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,360
Why bother?

1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,800
The game is rigged.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,440
My vote won't count.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,960
The choices are terrible.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,080
Voting is for suckers.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,416
Perhaps you've thought
some of these things.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,869
Perhaps you've even said them.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,960
And if so, you wouldn't be alone,
and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,056
The game of public policy today
is rigged in many ways.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,056
How else would more than half
of federal tax breaks

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,560
flow up to the wealthiest
five percent of Americans?

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
And our choices indeed are often terrible.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,536
For many people
across the political spectrum,

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,720
Exhibit A is the 2016
presidential election.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,296
But in any year, you can look
up and down the ballot

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,000
and find plenty to be uninspired about.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,976
But in spite of all this,
I still believe voting matters.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,896
And crazy as it may sound,

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,160
I believe we can revive the joy of voting.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,320
Today, I want to talk
about how we can do that, and why.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,256
There used to be a time
in American history when voting was fun,

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,480
when it was much more than just
a grim duty to show up at the polls.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,496
That time is called
"most of American history."

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,936
(Laughter)

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,936
From the Revolution
to the Civil Rights Era,

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,536
the United States had a vibrant,

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,800
robustly participatory
and raucous culture of voting.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,616
It was street theater, open-air debates,
fasting and feasting and toasting,

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,696
parades and bonfires.

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,256
During the 19th century,
immigrants and urban political machines

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
helped fuel this culture of voting.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,920
That culture grew with each
successive wave of new voters.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,976
During Reconstruction,
when new African-American voters,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,720
new African-American citizens,

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,576
began to exercise their power,

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,816
they celebrated in jubilee parades

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,200
that connected emancipation
with their newfound right to vote.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,840
A few decades later, the suffragettes

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,776
brought a spirit
of theatricality to their fight,

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
marching together in white dresses
as they claimed the franchise.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,216
And the Civil Rights Movement,

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,015
which sought to redeem
the promise of equal citizenship

42
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,039
that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,277
put voting right at the center.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,736
From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,976
that generation of activists
knew that voting matters,

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,096
and they knew that spectacle
and the performance of power

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,080
is key to actually claiming power.

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
But it's been over a half century
since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,856
and in the decades since,

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,176
this face-to-face culture of voting

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,176
has just about disappeared.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,136
It's been killed by television

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,696
and then the internet.

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,016
The couch has replaced the commons.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,016
Screens have made
citizens into spectators.

56
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,336
And while it's nice to share
political memes on social media,

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,520
that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,200
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle
calls "being alone together."

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,816
What we need today

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,696
is an electoral culture
that is about being together together,

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,936
in person,

62
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,176
in loud and passionate ways,

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,456
so that instead of being
"eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"

64
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,456
voting can feel more like "join the club"

65
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,160
or, better yet, "join the party."

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,696
Imagine if we had,
across the country right now,

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,656
in local places but nationwide,

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,336
a concerted effort
to revive a face-to-face set of ways

69
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
to engage and electioneer:

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,456
outdoor shows in which candidates
and their causes are mocked

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,176
and praised in broad satirical style;

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
soapbox speeches by citizens;

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,160
public debates held inside pubs;

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,656
streets filled with political art
and handmade posters and murals;

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,720
battle of the band concerts in which
competing performers rep their candidates.

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,416
Now, all of this may sound
a little bit 18th century to you,

77
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,776
but in fact, it doesn't have to be
any more 18th century

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,016
than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
which is to say vibrantly contemporary.

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
And the fact is that all around the world,

81
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:23,256
today, millions of people
are voting like this.

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,536
In India, elections are colorful,
communal affairs.

83
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,320
In Brazil, election day
is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.

84
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,456
In Taiwan and Hong Kong,
there is a spectacle,

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,736
eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,040
to the street theater of elections.

87
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,456
You might ask, well,
here in America, who has time for this?

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,736
And I would tell you

89
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,840
that the average American
watches five hours of television a day.

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,536
You might ask, who has the motivation?

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,776
And I'll tell you,

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,936
any citizen who wants to be seen and heard

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,256
not as a prop, not as a talking point,

94
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,600
but as a participant, as a creator.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,080
Well, how do we make this happen?

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
Simply by making it happen.

97
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,776
That's why a group of colleagues and I

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,880
launched a new project
called "The Joy of Voting."

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,336
In four cities across the United States --

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,016
Philadelphia, Miami,

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,496
Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,456
we've gathered together
artists and activists,

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,216
educators, political folks,
neighbors, everyday citizens

104
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,976
to come together and create projects

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,560
that can foster this culture
of voting in a local way.

106
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,296
In Miami, that means
all-night parties with hot DJs

107
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,654
where the only way to get in
is to show that you're registered to vote.

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,176
In Akron, it means political plays

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,736
being performed
in the bed of a flatbed truck

110
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,880
that moves from neighborhood
to neighborhood.

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,176
In Philadelphia,

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,136
it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt
all throughout colonial old town.

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,176
And in Wichita, it's making
mixtapes and live graffiti art

114
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
in the North End to get out the vote.

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,256
There are 20 of these projects,

116
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,136
and they are remarkable
in their beauty and their diversity,

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,736
and they are changing people.

118
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,816
Let me tell you about a couple of them.

119
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,816
In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,

120
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,856
a young artist named Atomico,

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
to create some vivid and vibrant images
for a new series of "I voted" stickers.

122
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,400
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.

123
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,776
He wasn't even registered.

124
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,296
So as he got to work on creating
this artwork for these stickers,

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,456
he also began to get over
his sense of intimidation about politics.

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,096
He got himself registered,

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,416
and then he got educated
about the upcoming primary election,

128
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,736
and on election day he was out there
not just passing out stickers,

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,336
but chatting up voters
and encouraging people to vote,

130
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,640
and talking about
the election with passersby.

131
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,496
In Akron, a theater company
called the Wandering Aesthetics

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,296
has been putting on
these pickup truck plays.

133
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,096
And to do so, they put out
an open call to the public

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,616
asking for speeches,
monologues, dialogues, poems,

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,976
snippets of anything
that could be read aloud

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
and woven into a performance.

137
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,040
They got dozens of submissions.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,616
One of them was a poem

139
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,776
written by nine students in an ESL class,

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,936
all of them Hispanic migrant workers

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
from nearby Hartville, Ohio.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,000
I want to read to you from this poem.

143
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
It's called "The Joy of Voting."

144
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,016
"I would like to vote for the first time

145
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,080
because things are changing for Hispanics.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,136
I used to be afraid of ghosts.

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,400
Now I am afraid of people.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,280
There's more violence and racism.

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
Voting can change this.

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
The border wall is nothing.

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just a wall.

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,640
The wall of shame is something.

153
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,696
It's very important to vote

154
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,080
so we can break down this wall of shame.

155
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,880
I have passion in my heart.

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,520
Voting gives me a voice and power.

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
I can stand up and do something."

158
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,896
"The Joy of Voting" project
isn't just about joy.

159
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,456
It's about this passion.

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,816
It's about feeling and belief,

161
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,040
and it isn't just our organization's work.

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,496
All across this country right now,

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,896
immigrants, young people, veterans,
people of all different backgrounds

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,416
are coming together to create
this kind of passionate, joyful activity

165
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,856
around elections,

166
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,816
in red and blue states,
in urban and rural communities,

167
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,936
people of every political background.

168
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,656
What they have in common is simply this:

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,200
their work is rooted in place.

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Because remember,
all citizenship is local.

171
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,256
When politics becomes
just a presidential election,

172
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,880
we yell and we scream at our screens,
and then we collapse, exhausted.

173
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,296
But when politics is about us

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,096
and our neighbors
and other people in our community

175
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,480
coming together to create experiences
of collective voice and imagination,

176
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,880
then we begin to remember
that this stuff matters.

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
We begin to remember
that this is the stuff of self-government.

178
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Which brings me back to where I began.

179
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,080
Why bother?

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,545
There's one way to answer this question.

181
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Voting matters because it is
a self-fulfilling act of belief.

182
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,840
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest
that makes any society thrive.

183
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,616
When we vote, even if it is in anger,

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,600
we are part of a collective,
creative leap of faith.

185
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,360
Voting helps us generate
the very power that we wish we had.

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,056
It's no accident
that democracy and theater

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
emerged around the same time
in ancient Athens.

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Both of them yank the individual
out of the enclosure of her private self.

189
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,080
Both of them create great
public experiences of shared ritual.

190
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,736
Both of them bring the imagination to life

191
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,056
in ways that remind us
that all of our bonds in the end

192
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,920
are imagined, and can be reimagined.

193
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,960
This moment right now,

194
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,216
when we think about
the meaning of imagination,

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
is so fundamentally important,

196
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,656
and our ability to take that spirit

197
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,256
and to take that sense

198
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,336
that there is something greater out there,

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,136
is not just a matter
of technical expertise.

200
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,216
It's not just a matter of making the time
or having the know-how.

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,520
It is a matter of spirit.

202
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,656
But let me give you an answer
to this question, "Why bother?"

203
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
that is maybe a little less spiritual
and a bit more pointed.

204
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,216
Why bother voting?

205
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,136
Because there is
no such thing as not voting.

206
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,976
Not voting is voting,

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,896
for everything that you
may detest and oppose.

208
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,656
Not voting can be dressed up

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,696
as an act of principled,
passive resistance,

210
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,656
but in fact not voting

211
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,896
is actively handing power over

212
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,256
to those whose interests
are counter to your own,

213
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,816
and those who would be very glad
to take advantage of your absence.

214
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,160
Not voting is for suckers.

215
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,496
Imagine where this country would be

216
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,616
if all the folks who in 2010
created the Tea Party

217
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,576
had decided that,
you know, politics is too messy,

218
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,856
voting is too complicated.

219
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,680
There is no possibility
of our votes adding up to anything.

220
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,616
They didn't preemptively
silence themselves.

221
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,416
They showed up,

222
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
and in the course of showing up,
they changed American politics.

223
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,256
Imagine if all of the followers
of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders

224
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,976
had decided not to upend
the political status quo

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,056
and blow apart the frame
of the previously possible

226
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,696
in American politics.

227
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,680
They did that by voting.

228
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,376
We live in a time right now,

229
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,936
divided, often very dark,

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,576
where across the left and the right,
there's a lot of talk of revolution

231
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,680
and the need for revolution
to disrupt everyday democracy.

232
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,736
Well, here's the thing:

233
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,760
everyday democracy already
gives us a playbook for revolution.

234
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,816
In the 2012 presidential election,

235
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,576
young voters, Latino voters,

236
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,856
Asian-American voters, low-income voters,

237
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,400
all showed up at less than 50 percent.

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,256
In the 2014 midterm elections,
turnout was 36 percent,

239
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
which was a 70-year low.

240
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,816
And in your average local election,

241
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,200
turnout hovers
somewhere around 20 percent.

242
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,560
I invite you to imagine 100 percent.

243
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,360
Picture 100 percent.

244
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,216
Mobilize 100 percent,

245
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
and overnight, we get revolution.

246
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,056
Overnight, the policy priorities
of this country change dramatically,

247
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,616
and every level of government
becomes radically more responsive

248
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
to all the people.

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
What would it take
to mobilize 100 percent?

250
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,016
Well, we do have to push back
against efforts afoot

251
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,776
all across the country right now

252
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
to make voting harder.

253
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,976
But at the same time,

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,136
we have to actively create
a positive culture of voting

255
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,776
that people want to belong to,

256
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,336
be part of, and experience together.

257
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,976
We have to make purpose.

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,320
We have to make joy.

259
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,816
So yes, let's have that revolution,

260
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,336
a revolution of spirit, of ideas,

261
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,376
of policy and participation,

262
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,536
a revolution against cynicism,

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
a revolution against the self-fulfilling
sense of powerlessness.

264
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,856
Let's vote this revolution into existence,

265
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,216
and while we're at it,

266
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,776
let's have some fun.

267
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,016
Thank you very much.

268
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,320
(Applause)
