00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:16,192
War has been a part of my life
since I can remember.

1
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:20,955
I was born in Afghanistan,
just six months after the Soviets invaded,

2
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:24,807
and even though I was too young
to understand what was happening,

3
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:28,152
I had a deep sense of the suffering
and the fear around me.

4
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,341
Those early experiences had a major impact
on how I now think about war and conflict.

5
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,487
I learned that when people
have a fundamental issue at stake,

6
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,763
for most of them,

7
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,419
giving in is not an option.

8
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,583
For these types conflicts --

9
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,392
when people's rights are violated,

10
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,186
when their countries are occupied,

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,428
when they're oppressed and humiliated --

12
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:52,610
they need a powerful way
to resist and to fight back.

13
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,571
Which means that no matter how destructive
and terrible violence is,

14
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:00,019
if people see it as their only choice,

15
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,500
they will use it.

16
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:05,650
Most of us are concerned
with the level of violence in the world.

17
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,499
But we're not going to end war

18
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:10,231
by telling people
that violence is morally wrong.

19
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:13,282
Instead, we must offer them a tool

20
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,645
that's at least as powerful
and as effective as violence.

21
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,060
This is the work I do.

22
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:21,256
For the past 13 years,

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,565
I've been teaching people

24
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:25,697
in some of the most difficult
situations around the world

25
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:29,088
how they can use nonviolent
struggle to conduct conflict.

26
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:34,803
Most people associate this type of action
with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

27
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:39,302
But people have been using
nonviolent action for thousands of years.

28
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:44,163
In fact, most of the rights
that we have today in this country --

29
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,338
as women,

30
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,513
as minorities,

31
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,885
as workers,

32
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,475
as people of different sexual orientations

33
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:52,957
and citizens concerned
with the environment --

34
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,838
these rights weren't handed to us.

35
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:57,386
They were won by people
who fought for them

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,232
and who sacrificed for them.

37
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:01,776
But because we haven't learned
from this history,

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,841
nonviolent struggle as a technique
is widely misunderstood.

39
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:09,610
I met recently with a group
of Ethiopian activists,

40
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,784
and they told me something
that I hear a lot.

41
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:15,134
They said they'd already
tried nonviolent action,

42
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:16,576
and it hadn't worked.

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,936
Years ago they held a protest.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,668
The government arrested everyone,
and that was the end of that.

45
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:27,262
The idea that nonviolent struggle
is equivalent to street protests

46
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:28,684
is a real problem.

47
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:33,604
Because although protests can be a great
way to show that people want change,

48
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:36,498
on their own, they don't
actually create change --

49
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,490
at least change that is fundamental.

50
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:39,702
(Laughter)

51
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,835
Powerful opponents are not going to give
people what they want

52
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,791
just because they asked nicely ...

53
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,396
or even not so nicely.

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,553
(Laughter)

55
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:51,621
Nonviolent struggle works
by destroying an opponent,

56
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,330
not physically,

57
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:57,764
but by identifying the institutions
that an opponent needs to survive,

58
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,970
and then denying them
those sources of power.

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,234
Nonviolent activists
can neutralize the military

60
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:05,482
by causing soldiers to defect.

61
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:08,781
They can disrupt the economy
through strikes and boycotts.

62
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,492
And they can challenge
government propaganda

63
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,382
by creating alternative media.

64
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,673
There are a variety of methods
that can be used to do this.

65
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:20,176
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,827
has identified 198 methods
of nonviolent action.

67
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,951
And protest is only one.

68
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,373
Let me give you a recent example.

69
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,354
Until a few months ago,

70
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,595
Guatemala was ruled
by corrupt former military officials

71
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,430
with ties to organized crime.

72
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,864
People were generally aware of this,

73
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:43,238
but most of them felt powerless
to do anything about it --

74
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,482
until one group of citizens,
just 12 regular people,

75
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:51,248
put out a call on Facebook
to their friends

76
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,511
to meet in the central plaza,
holding signs with a message:

77
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,431
"Renuncia YA" --

78
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,440
resign already.

79
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,608
To their surprise,

80
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,392
30,000 people showed up.

81
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:06,482
They stayed there for months
as protests spread throughout the country.

82
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,088
At one point,

83
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,300
the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs
to various government buildings

84
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,491
with a message:

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,846
"If you don't have the huevos" --

86
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,076
the balls --

87
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,154
"to stop corrupt candidates
from running for office,

88
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,636
you can borrow ours."

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,319
(Laughter)

90
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,698
(Applause)

91
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,988
President Molina responded

92
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,148
by vowing that he would never step down.

93
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:36,275
And the activists realized
that they couldn't just keep protesting

94
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,313
and ask the president to resign.

95
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,333
They needed to leave him no choice.

96
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,724
So they organized a general strike,

97
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,395
in which people throughout
the country refused to work.

98
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,821
In Guatemala City alone,

99
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,794
over 400 businesses
and schools shut their doors.

100
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,548
Meanwhile,

101
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:54,201
farmers throughout the country
blocked major roads.

102
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,703
Within five days,

103
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,904
the president,

104
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,651
along with dozens of other
government officials,

105
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,144
resigned already.

106
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,451
(Applause)

107
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,078
I've been greatly inspired

108
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:11,005
by the creativity and bravery
of people using nonviolent action

109
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,252
in nearly every country in the world.

110
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:14,869
For example,

111
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,450
recently a group of activists in Uganda

112
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,607
released a crate of pigs in the streets.

113
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,534
You can see here that the police
are confused about what to do with them.

114
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,594
(Laughter)

115
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,234
The pigs were painted
the color of the ruling party.

116
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:29,895
One pig was even wearing a hat,

117
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,799
a hat that people recognized.

118
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,384
(Laughter)

119
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,633
Activists around the world
are getting better at grabbing headlines,

120
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,320
but these isolated actions do very little

121
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,527
if they're not part of a larger strategy.

122
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:45,153
A general wouldn't march
his troops into battle

123
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,308
unless he had a plan to win the war.

124
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:50,443
Yet this is how most of the world's
nonviolent movements operate.

125
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:55,216
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex
as military warfare,

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,438
if not more.

127
00:05:56,462 --> 00:06:00,657
Its participants must be well-trained
and have clear objectives,

128
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,513
and its leaders must have a strategy
of how to achieve those objectives.

129
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:08,508
The technique of war has been developed
over thousands of years

130
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,079
with massive resources

131
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,349
and some of our best minds
dedicated to understanding

132
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,098
and improving how it works.

133
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:20,190
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle
is rarely systematically studied,

134
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,224
and even though the number is growing,

135
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,033
there are still only a few dozen people
in the world who are teaching it.

136
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,142
This is dangerous,

137
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,334
because we now know that our old
approaches of dealing with conflict

138
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,776
are not adequate for the new
challenges that we're facing.

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,883
The US government recently admitted

140
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:40,820
that it's in a stalemate
in its war against ISIS.

141
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,062
But what most people don't know

142
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,600
is that people have stood up to ISIS
using nonviolent action.

143
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,930
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,

144
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:54,685
they announced that they were putting
in place a new public school curriculum,

145
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,839
based on their own extremist ideology.

146
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,096
But on the first day of school,

147
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:01,358
not a single child showed up.

148
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,044
Parents simply refused to send them.

149
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:08,260
They told journalists they would rather
homeschool their children

150
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:09,840
than to have them brainwashed.

151
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,698
This is an example
of just one act of defiance

152
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,077
in just one city.

153
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,104
But what if it was coordinated

154
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,750
with the dozens of other acts
of nonviolent resistance

155
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,829
that have taken place against ISIS?

156
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:25,288
What if the parents' boycott
was part of a larger strategy

157
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:29,538
to identify and cut off the resources
that ISIS needs to function;

158
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,653
the skilled labor needed to produce food;

159
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:36,266
the engineers needed
to extract and refine oil;

160
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,883
the media infrastructure
and communications networks

161
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,880
and transportation systems,

162
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,408
and the local businesses
that ISIS relies on?

163
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,032
It may be difficult
to imagine defeating ISIS

164
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,967
with action that is nonviolent.

165
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,619
But it's time we challenge
the way we think about conflict

166
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,058
and the choices we have in facing it.

167
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:58,465
Here's an idea worth spreading:

168
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:01,644
let's learn more about where
nonviolent action has worked

169
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:04,185
and how we can make it more powerful,

170
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,253
just like we do with other
systems and technologies

171
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:10,836
that are constantly being refined
to better meet human needs.

172
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:14,905
It may be that we can improve
nonviolent action

173
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,180
to a point where it is increasingly
used in place of war.

174
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:22,913
Violence as a tool of conflict
could then be abandoned

175
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,344
in the same way that bows and arrows were,

176
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:28,712
because we have replaced them
with weapons that are more effective.

177
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:34,306
With human innovation, we can make
nonviolent struggle more powerful

178
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,954
than the newest and latest
technologies of war.

179
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,473
The greatest hope for humanity
lies not in condemning violence

180
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:44,860
but in making violence obsolete.

181
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,516
Thank you.

182
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,935
(Applause)
