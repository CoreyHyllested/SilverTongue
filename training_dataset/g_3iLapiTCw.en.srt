00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

1
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:17,787
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.

2
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,930
where we are looking to find

3
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,470
alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,278
That's what we're after.

5
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,458
And we do this because we actually believe

6
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,732
that silicon technology today is mostly about

7
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,484
a culture of excess.

8
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,657
It's about the fastest and the most efficient

9
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:38,087
and the most dazzling gadget you can have,

10
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:40,985
while about two-thirds of the world

11
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:44,669
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology

12
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,252
to even address fundamental needs in life,

13
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,420
including health care, education

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,499
and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.

15
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:57,744
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,

16
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:01,767
a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.

17
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,954
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.

18
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:06,060
He is an outstanding person,

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,202
because he's a small entrepreneur.

20
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,944
He runs a little shop

21
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,947
in one of the back streets of Mumbai.

22
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,995
He has this little 10-square-meter store,

23
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:17,145
where so much is being done.

24
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,050
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes

25
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,533
when I once just happened to bump into him.

26
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,658
Basically, what he does is, he has all these services

27
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,411
for micro-payments and booking tickets

28
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:29,744
and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,

29
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:31,933
but he does it for people offline

30
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,930
and connects to the digital world.

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,435
More importantly, he makes his money

32
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:38,028
by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,

33
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:40,303
for the prepaid subscriptions.

34
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:43,544
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook

35
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:46,117
with a few of his employees

36
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:48,701
where they can fix almost anything.

37
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:51,959
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,077
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,

39
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,246
and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"

40
00:01:57,246 --> 00:01:59,564
"Yes." (Laughter)

41
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,504
I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided

42
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:06,137
to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)

43
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:11,352
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering

44
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:16,304
and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.

45
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,895
They have figured out everything that's required

46
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:20,921
to dismantle, take things apart,

47
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,880
rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,847
do whatever you want to with the phone,

49
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,416
and they can fix anything so quickly.

50
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,416
You can hand over a phone this morning

51
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,336
and you can go pick it up after lunch,

52
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,256
and it was quite incredible.

53
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,827
But then we were wondering whether this is

54
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:38,369
a local phenomenon, or is truly global?

55
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,619
And, over time, we started understanding

56
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,338
and systematically researching

57
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,454
what this tinkering ecosystem is about,

58
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,059
because that is something that's happening

59
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,091
not just in one street corner in Mumbai.

60
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,205
It's actually happening in all parts of the country.

61
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,466
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,

62
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,513
in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.

63
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:58,708
Even here in Doha I found this little nook

64
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,595
where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,

65
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,796
and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.

66
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:06,909
You've got to try it on your own to believe it.

67
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,463
But what fuels this?

68
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:11,971
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts

69
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:15,277
and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,

70
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:19,043
and then redistributed to basically service this industry,

71
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:21,214
and you can even buy salvaged parts.

72
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,370
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,833
brand new things. You have condemned computers

74
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,140
that are stripped apart,

75
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,710
and you can buy salvaged components

76
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,531
and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.

77
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:36,012
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?

78
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:37,932
That's the real question, because this is something

79
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:40,157
that's been there, part of every society

80
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:42,523
that's deprived of enough resources.

81
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,420
But there's an interesting paradigm.

82
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,912
There's the traditional crafts,

83
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,915
and then there's the technology crafts.

84
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,123
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.

85
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,195
They're not something that's been established.

86
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,862
It's not something that's institutionalized.

87
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,633
It's not taught in universities.

88
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,356
It's taught [by] word of mouth,

89
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:00,265
and it's an informal education system around this.

90
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:03,067
So we said, "What can we get out of this?

91
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,801
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"

92
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,146
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,

93
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,486
which is fantastic because it means that your product

94
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,531
or your service doesn't have to go through

95
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:15,139
a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.

96
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,218
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,

97
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,250
so it means that you can do a lot more with it.

98
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,564
And then, the most important thing is,

99
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,940
it gives us large math for low cost.

100
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,269
So it means that you can actually embed

101
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,794
pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds

102
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:34,452
of extendable ideas into really simple devices.

103
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:39,260
So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.

104
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,206
It's basically what was the system or the paradigm

105
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,670
before the industrial revolution is now re-happening

106
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,678
in a whole new way in small digital shops

107
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,759
across the planet in most developing countries.

108
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,893
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,

109
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,571
and we said, "What can we do with this?

110
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,099
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"

111
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,519
So one of the first things we did is this thing called

112
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,915
a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.

113
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,666
Basically one of the contexts that we studied was

114
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:10,153
schools in very remote parts of India.

115
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:13,412
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,

116
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,114
which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker

117
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,591
who teaches this amazing little social setting.

118
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,128
It's an informal school,

119
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,287
but it's really about holistic education.

120
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,525
The only thing that they don't have

121
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,919
is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook

122
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,746
sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.

123
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:32,250
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher

124
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,062
to do more?" How to access the digital world?

125
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,624
Instead of being the sole guardian of information,

126
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:40,028
be a facilitator to all this information.

127
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,412
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"

128
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:46,067
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,

129
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,599
and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform

130
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,591
that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"

131
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,934
So we walked around.

132
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,224
We went and scavenged the nearby markets,

133
00:05:56,224 --> 00:06:00,245
and we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"

134
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,772
So the thing that we got

135
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:05,979
was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector

136
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,316
that comes for about 60 dollars.

137
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,772
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,

138
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,562
and a bunch of small speakers.

139
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,860
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us

140
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,784
a connected multimedia platform.

141
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:20,269
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files

142
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,620
of different formats and play them.

143
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,646
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,

144
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:28,637
and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,

145
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,853
and the lunch box is a nice little package

146
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,900
in which you can put everything inside,

147
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,463
and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of

148
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:35,881
amplify the sound large enough.

149
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:39,420
Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.

150
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,013
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,

151
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:43,673
and you really have to get above that.

152
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,394
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup

153
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,484
of a mobile phone repair shop,

154
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:49,912
and then the magic happens.

155
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,293
We dismantle the whole thing,

156
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,650
we reassemble it in a new configuration,

157
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,828
and we do this hardware mashup,

158
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,437
systematically training the guy how to do this.

159
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:01,892
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.

160
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:08,718
(Applause)

161
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,736
And we systematically field tested,

162
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:14,104
because in the field testing we learned some

163
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,621
important lessons, and we went through many iterations.

164
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,316
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.

165
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:23,294
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.

166
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,846
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough

167
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,974
darkness in the classroom to do these things.

168
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:31,816
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,

169
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:34,394
and the next version we came up with was a box

170
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:36,774
that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,

171
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:39,573
but most importantly connect to a car battery,

172
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:42,567
because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power

173
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,774
in places where there's not enough electricity

174
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,734
or erratic electricity.

175
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,703
And the other key thing that we did was

176
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:51,165
make this box run off a USB key, because we realized

177
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:54,519
that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,

178
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,094
at least, in theory, it was much more efficient

179
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:00,984
to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.

180
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,824
It might take a few days to get there,

181
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:05,198
but at least it gets there in high definition

182
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,413
and in a reliable quality.

183
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,695
So we made this box, and we tested it again

184
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,230
and again and again, and we're going through

185
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,779
multiple iterations to do these things.

186
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,748
But it's not limited to just education.

187
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:17,614
This kind of a technique or metrology

188
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,626
can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,

189
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,534
and I'm going to tell you one more little story.

190
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,989
It's about this little device called a medi-meter.

191
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:27,356
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.

192
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:30,683
In India, there is a context of these amazing people,

193
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,962
the health care workers called ASHA workers.

194
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,379
They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system

195
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,763
who live in the local community and are trained

196
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,331
with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,

197
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:44,093
and the main purpose is basically to inform people

198
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:47,626
to basically, how to lead a better life, but also

199
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,854
to divert or sort of make recommendations

200
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,528
of what kind of health care should they approach?

201
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,240
They are basically referral services, essentially.

202
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,548
But the problem with that is that we realized

203
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:02,738
after a bunch of research that they are amazing

204
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:05,218
at referring people to the nearest clinic

205
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:08,091
or the public health care system, but what happens at the

206
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:12,169
public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines

207
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,979
and too many people who overload the system

208
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,545
simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities

209
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:19,747
for the population that's being referred.

210
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:21,866
So everything from a common cold

211
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,526
to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same

212
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:27,570
level of attention, and there's no priorities.

213
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,641
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way

214
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,442
of doing this for sure."

215
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:34,019
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker

216
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,950
that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,

217
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,465
but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral

218
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:43,946
system that allows load balancing of the network,

219
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:47,885
and directs patients to different sources of health care

220
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,765
based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"

221
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,746
So the real key question was,

222
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,414
how do we empower this woman?

223
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,341
How do we empower her with simple tools

224
00:09:57,341 --> 00:10:00,292
that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature

225
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:04,072
so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?

226
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,100
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,

227
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,018
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of

228
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:12,938
distances that people need to travel, often sometimes

229
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:15,611
seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,

230
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:21,074
to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental

231
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,528
in the sense that it really dissuades people

232
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,537
from getting access to health care.

233
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,572
So if there was something that she could do,

234
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:28,681
that would be amazing.

235
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:31,742
So what we did was that we converted this device

236
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,559
into a medical device.

237
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,835
I want to demo this actually,

238
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,508
because it's a very simple process.

239
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,917
Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)

240
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:46,119
Come along. (Applause)

241
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:49,044
So, what we're going to do is that

242
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:52,016
we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,

243
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:54,871
including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen

244
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,744
that's there in your blood.

245
00:10:56,744 --> 00:11:00,035
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.

246
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,809
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?

247
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,475
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.

248
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:07,483
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.

249
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:11,833
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.

250
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,845
So ... (Laughter)

251
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:18,236
So I take it into the start position, and then

252
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:21,848
I press the read button. (Beeps)

253
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:27,329
So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)

254
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:30,107
And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.

255
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,382
Let's see what happens here.

256
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,465
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.

257
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:39,301
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)

258
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,646
VV: So ... (Applause)

259
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:44,863
So the thing about this is that

260
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:48,968
if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,

261
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,814
we would have to rush you to a hospital.

262
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:54,934
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange

263
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,763
or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,

264
00:11:57,763 --> 00:12:00,807
sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.

265
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,158
So that was a very simple three-step screening process

266
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,273
that could basically change the equation

267
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:08,013
of how public health care works in so many different ways.

268
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,910
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.

269
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,303
(Applause)

270
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:17,743
So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,

271
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,033
because that's the more interesting part.

272
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,727
So essentially, the three things that are required

273
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:27,255
to make this conversion from this guy to this guy

274
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:31,384
is a cheap remote control for a television

275
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,295
that you can almost find in every home today,

276
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,009
some parts from a computer mouse, basically,

277
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,872
something that you can scavenge for very low cost,

278
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:44,783
and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.

279
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:47,184
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few

280
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,979
extra components that can be shipped for very little cost

281
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,972
across the world, and that's what is all required

282
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,363
with a little bit of local tinkering talent

283
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,150
to convert the device into something else.

284
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,546
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests

285
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:04,596
to basically ascertain whether something like this actually

286
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,163
makes sense to the ASHA worker.

287
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:09,707
We are going through some reference tests to compare it

288
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:13,165
against professional equipment to see if there's a degree

289
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,487
of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact

290
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:18,095
in people's lives. But most importantly,

291
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,890
what we are trying to do right now

292
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,144
is we are trying to scale this up, because there

293
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,831
are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground

294
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,568
who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can

295
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:31,128
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,

296
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:34,086
it just changes the way the economics of public health care

297
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:37,097
works, and it changes the way systems actually function,

298
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:41,363
not just on a systematic planning level,

299
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,548
but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.

300
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:47,349
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.

301
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:50,507
Thank you. (Applause)

302
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:59,153
(Applause)
