    <h1><u>Confidence</u></h1>
    <h2>Filler word rate</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/filler_word_rate.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}

<!--    This metric measures how often you say any of the following:
    'so', 'like', 'um', 'okay', and 'just'.  Sure, there are legitimate uses for all
    those words, and in TED talks there's an average of around one of them every
    minute.  But in general these words are used to fill in gaps when the
    speaker doesn't know what they want to say next. -->
    <h2>Repeated word rate</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/repeated_word_rate.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}{{session}}/repeated_word_rate.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% endif %}
<!--    Similar to using filler words, it's easy to get tripped up in the middle of
    a statement not knowing where you're headed and repeat a word while you sort
    out your thoughts.  TED speakers have this habit pretty well eradicated. -->
    <h1><u>Pacing</u></h1>
    <h2>Average words per minute</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/avg_wpm.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}{{session}}/avg_wpm.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% endif %}
<!--    Finding the optimal speaking speed is a balance between clarity, energy, and
    information transfer.  Speak too quickly and people start to lose you.
    Speak too slowly and people start to get bored.  TED speakers tend to speak
    at about 150 words per minute, but there's a wide range of speaking rates
    represented in TED talk, so don't worry if you're a bit off that mark. -->
    <h2>Speed variation</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/wpm_variation.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}{{session}}/wpm_variation.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% endif %}
<!--    Barreling through your talk at a constant speed risks leaving the audience
    shell-shocked.  To keep your audience engaged, you want to speak more
    quickly at some point to raise the energy level, but slow down to emphasize
    an important point.  TED speakers tend to vary their speed by about 20% on
    average. -->
    <h1><u>Dynamism</u></h1>
    <h2>Pitch variation</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/pitch_variation.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}{{session}}/pitch_variation.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% endif %}
<!--    A monotone presentation can be painful to watch, but a wildly excited
    speaker can be equally off-putting.  The sweet spot in pitch variation for
    TED speakers is around 25%. -->
    <h1><u>Clarity</u></h1>
    <h2>Average word clarity score</h2>
    {% if not ready %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}references/average_word_score.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% else %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = '') }}{{session}}/average_word_score.png" width="640"/><br>
    {% endif %}
<!--    This metric, powered by SpeechAce, listens to the individual sounds of each
    word the speaker says and compares them to the accepted pronunciation of
    that word.  Consequently, this score will also be reduced when the speaker
    says 'um' or something similar just before a word.  Even TED speakers only
    reach a 90% clarity score on average, so don't worry about getting your number
    up to 100%.  That would probably require you to speak much more slowly than
    is optimal.  Find a balance that works for you! -->
